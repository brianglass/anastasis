Commemoration of our Venerable Father, Antony the Great.

You were enlightened by the rays of the Spirit when love inspired by God
set you aflame and gave wings to your soul to long for the true highest
point of love. Then you despised both flesh and blood and, united to
this love by great ascetic toil and stillness, you lived far from the
world. Therefore, Antony, you were filled, as you had sought, with good
things from there, and, like a shining Star, gave light to our souls.

[([Twice]{style="color:red;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic"})]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"}

[By the grace of GodÂ’s Spirit you smashed the arrows and darts of the
demons, and you unmasked their wickedness and ambush for all by godlike
teachings, as you blazed with godlike radiance and became the brightest
beacon of monastics, and the first ornament of the desert, most
experienced and revered physician of the sick and archetypal model of
virtuous living, Father Antony.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;

[Filled with GodÂ’s gifts of grace, Christ, having found you as an
unsullied mirror of the manifestations of God, made the bright lightning
flashes of his own light blaze for you. From this you appeared as an
unstinted source of healings, nourishment for the starving and quenching
through abundant rains the desire of the thirsty, while seeing the
dispositions of souls, by your word you wisely made them better for God.
Implore him to save and enlighten our
souls.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"}

Pure in soul and heart, an Angel on earth, a heavenly mortal, teacher of
virginity, accurate measure of self-mastery, blessed Antony, united to
your Master and bringing to him with the Angels, all the holy Ascetics
and Martyrs the never silent hymn of glory, free from dread dangers and
faults all those who ever celebrate your sacred memory.

[Glory]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-style:normal"}[.

[Having preserved unblemished that which is according to GodÂ’s image,
by ascetic endeavour determining the mind as leader against destructive
passions, you ascended as far as possible to that which is according to
GodÂ’s likeness. For bravely overmastering nature, you hastened to
submit the worse to the better, and to make the flesh the slave of the
spirit. Therefore you were named Â‘summit of monasticsÂ’, Â‘founder of
the desertÂ’[[\[1\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn1){#_ftnref1}, Â‘trainer
of those who run wellÂ’, Â‘most accurate rule of virtueÂ’, and now in
heaven, Antony, where mirrors are abolished, you look directly at the
holy Trinity[[\[2\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference

with no intermediary on behalf of those who honour you with faith and
love.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;

duality of persons, but known without confusion in a duality of natures.

**At the Liti, Idiomel Stichera.\
Tone 2. By the Studite.**

Constructing an ascetic gymnastic school on earth, Venerable Antony, you
blunted all the assaults of the passions with the stream of your tears.
Your godly way of life was acknowledged for all as a ladder leading up
to heaven; for by it you displayed the fruits of true religion, and
through them you the diseases of the passions of those who cry to with
faith, Â‘Hail, radiant golden star of the East, torchbearer and shepherd
of Monastics! Hail, fairest offspring of the desert, and unshakeable
bulwark of the Church! Hail, great guide of those who gone astray! Hail,
our boast, and bright glory of the inhabited world!

[Same Tone]{style="color:red"}

Let us honour Antony, Angel on earth and man of God in heaven, ornament
of the world, delight of the good and of the virtues, boast of ascetics;
for planted in the house of God, he flowered righteously and, like a
cedar in the desert, he multiplied the flocks of ChristÂ’s rational
sheep with holiness and justice[[\[3\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn3){#_ftnref3}.

[Same Tone]{style="color:red"}

Venerable Father, from childhood you practised virtue assiduously and
became an instrument of the Holy Spirit; receiving from him power to
work wonders, you persuaded men to despise pleasures; while now, as you
shine more brightly by the divine light, enlighten our minds also,
Father Antony.

[Tone 3. By Anatolios]{style="color:red"}

Venerable Antony, as though at rest among non-material things, you
accomplished the ardent and courageous life of the strictest discipline,
and bravely resisting the assaults of demons, you triumphed over their
weakness and their soul-destroying error; while you displayed the force
and invincible power of the SaviourÂ’s Cross; and girded with its power,
you defeated all those who reject ChristÂ’s divine manifestation through
the flesh. Implore him that our souls may be given his great mercy.

Glory. [Tone 5.]{style="color:red"}

Venerable Father, when you heard the voice of the LordÂ’s Gospel you
abandoned the world, reckoning its wealth and glory to be nothing. And
so you cried to all, Â‘Love God, and you will find everlasting grace.
Prefer nothing to his love, so that when he comes in his glory, you may
find rest with all the Saints. At his intercessions, O Christ, guard and
save our souls.

Both now. [Theotokion. Same Tone.]{style="color:red"}

Virgin Mother of God, we the faithful call you blessed and glorify you
as is fitting, the unshakeable city, the unbreachable wall, the
indestructible protection and refuge of our souls.

[**At the Aposticha Prosomia Stichera.\
Tone 5. Hail, of ascetics.**]{style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"}

[Hail, prince of ascetics and their undefeated champion, for cutting out
the roots of the passions and withstanding the assaults of the demons,
you triumphed over their enfeeblements and their soul-destroying error.
You displayed the unconquerable power of the SaviourÂ’s Cross. Clothed
in it you conquered all those who reject ChristÂ’s divine manifestation
through flesh. Implore him to grant our souls his great
mercy.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"}

[Hail, Antony, companion of the angelic choirs in the highest, for you
truly lived their way of life on earth, practising virtue, and you
appeared as a pure unsullied mirror, reflecting the dazzling lightning
flashes of the Holy Spirit, all-happy Father. And so you were illumined
and saw what was to come, foretelling all things, initiated by the
divine light of ChristÂ’s manifestation. Implore him to grant our souls
his great mercy.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"}

[Established by virtues, you became a pillar formed of light and an
overshadowing cloud for those in the desert, leading those who see God
from earth to heaven. With the staff of the Cross you divided the sea of
the passions, while by routing the spiritual Amalek you found the
unimpeded ascent to heaven, O blessed of God, and an unsullied lot with
the Bodiless Powers, as you stand with greatest joy before the throne of
Christ, implore him to grant our souls his great
mercy[[\[6\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference

[We multitudes of monastics honour you as our teacher and guide, for
through you we have learned to walk the truly straight path. Blessed are
you, for enslaved to Christ you triumphed over the power of the foe,
companion of Angels and comrade of Paul the Theban. With them intercede
with the Lord to have mercy on our souls.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;

All-unblemished, who grant to all purification of faults. Now receive
our supplications and implore that we may all be

the Baptist by straight paths, our Father Anthony; you became the
founder of the desert and strengthened the whole world by your prayers.

souls from death.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"}
