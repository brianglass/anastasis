INTRODUCTION

In present practice the Marriage rites of the Orthodox Church comprise
two services that are celebrated together, that of Betrothal, or the
exchange of rings, and that of Crowning, or the marriage itself.
Originally these were quite distinct services, separated in time by
months, or even years.

It is usual nowadays for marriages to be celebrated outside the Divine
Liturgy, although originally Crowning took place in the course of the
Eucharist, and this is still sometimes done in contemporary use. It is
generally thought that the ‘Common Cup’, which the Bride and Groom drink
from at the end of the ceremony, is a survival of the original setting
in the Liturgy. This is not certain, however, and a rubric in the tenth
century Euchologion from Grottaferrata, G.b.VII, suggests otherwise. It
runs, ‘**And he \[the priest\]** **makes them partake of the life-giving
communion, and having taken a cup of wine and blessed it with the sign
of the Cross, he says the following Prayer of the Common Cup’, i.e. the
one in the present rite.**

There are numerous local customs surrounding weddings that are not
mentioned in the official texts, some of which are extremely
interesting, some of which would be better abandoned, or confined to the
secular celebrations following the service in church. None of these is
given here.

The translation published here has been made from the current Greek
text, from which the Slavonic differs little, most notably in the
provision of a formal questioning of the couple as to their freedom and
intent at the beginning of the service.

There is a number of problems of translation in these texts, some of
which are listed here, in order not to clutter the translation with
footnotes.

> 1.  At the beginning of the rite of Crowning the older rubric simply
>     says, ‘**If they wish to be crowned on the same occasion, they
>     enter the Church with lighted candles. The Priest goes ahead with
>     the censer singing the Psalm as follows.’ This suggests that, as
>     one would expect, the Betrothal should take place in the narthex
>     and not in the body of the church.**
> 2.  It is worth noting that in a number of places, particularly where
>     the reference is to Genesis 2 and 3, the Greek word ‘anthropos’ is
>     used to refer to the man, and is not gender inclusive.
> 3.  I use ‘wedlock’ in the first prayer of the Crowning for ‘syzygia’,
>     since the Greek word suggests marriage and the number of English
>     words for ‘uniting’ is somewhat limited.
> 4.  The Greek words ‘gynÃª’ and ‘aner’ ** present difficulties for the
>     translator, since they mean both ‘man’ and ‘husband’, and ‘woman’
>     and ‘wife’*.* In the citation from Genesis 2,23 the play in Hebrew
>     on ‘ish’, ‘man’ and ‘ishah’, ‘woman’ cannot be reproduced in
>     Greek, but is possible in Latin by the use of ‘vir’ and ‘virago’,
>     and in English, though in the latter the idea of ‘husband’ and
>     ‘wife’ is obscured.
> 5.  The formulae for the actual exchange of rings and for the crowning
>     present problems. In each case the verb is Middle or Passive in
>     form and is followed by the accusative. The latter fact makes it
>     unlikely that the verbs are passive, unless one assumes that the
>     accusatives are very peculiar accusatives ‘of respect’. The verb
>     ‘arravonizomai’, which is not classical, is deponent and means ‘to
>     give a pledge’, or ‘guarantee’. This makes perfectly good sense,
>     like the archaic English, ‘to plight one’s troth’. The verb is
>     used as a passive with the sense of ‘receive a pledge’. It does
>     not, however, mean ‘is betrothed’. On the other hand the verb
>     ‘stepho’, which is used predominantly in poetry in the classical
>     language, does have an active form and means ‘to wreathe’, or
>     ‘crown’, and the fact that here it has a direct object suggests
>     that it is Middle rather than Passive. Indeed it would be an
>     almost classical use of the Middle. The tendency for English
>     versions of these rites to use passives stems, I suspect, by false
>     analogy from the formula for Baptism, where, it is worth pointing
>     out, the verb is a true passive, with no direct object. It is also
>     worth noting that the formula of Crowning is later than that for
>     Betrothal, and in the earlier forms of the rite most frequently
>     took the form of appropriate verses from the Psalms.
> 6.  In the final prayer there are two points worth noting. 1. The word
>     translated ‘life-creating’ is not ‘zoopoios’ but ‘zoarchikos’,
>     which does therefore mean ‘source/origin of life’ and hence may
>     legitimately be rendered ‘life-creating’. 2. Since the Greek word
>     ‘basileia’ refers to the Holy Trinity it can hardly be translated
>     ‘Kingdom’*.* Like its Hebrew counterpart, the Greek is both less
>     concrete and at the same time wider in its reference than the
>     English ‘kingdom’, and should often be translated by ‘kingship’ or
>     by a similar word.
> 7.  The Prayer for the Untying of Crowns presents a number of
>     problems. In Greek the only finite verb is in the 1st person
>     plural, which means that the three participles that precede it
>     cannot refer to the newly married couple, but rather to the priest
>     \[and people\]. The Slavonic, however, has the verb in the 3rd
>     person. ‘Your servants’ then must refer to the couple. The meaning
>     of the third phrase is not clear. Since the first two participles
>     are aorist and the third present, it seems that this phrase refers
>     to the present ceremony. Both the Greek and Slavonic verbs convey
>     the idea of ‘removing’, though none of the senses given for the
>     former in either Liddell and Scott or Lampe seems to be precisely
>     apposite, and I think that the reference must be to the removal of
>     the crowns.

At the end of the rite of Crowning will be found the short rite for the
Untying of Crowns, the rite for a Subsequent Marriage and that for
Renewing a Marriage, after divorce.
