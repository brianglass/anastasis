Anastasis
=========
Archimandrite Ephrem (Lash) was well known for his translations of Orthodox liturgical and patristic texts. 
With his passing (may his memory be eternal!), easy access to his translations were lost. I have attempted to begin
a correspondence with the appropriate people in order to make sure this repository is permitted, but am making 
these texts available here in the interim.

Please begin with [Archimandrite Ephrem's Index](index.md).
