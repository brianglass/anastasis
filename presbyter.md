[O God, without beginning and without end, you are older than all
creation, and have honoured with the title of Â‘PresbyterÂ’ those who
have been found worthy of this rank to minister the word of your truth.
Master of all things, be well pleased for this man, who, because of his
unblemished way of life and unswerving faith, you have been well pleased
to be appointed through me, to receive this great grace of the Holy
Spirit. Show your servant to be perfect, by being well-pleasing to you
in all things, and living in a manner worthy of this great honour of the
Priesthood that has been given him by your providential power. Because
yours is the might, and yours is the Kingdom, and the power, and the
glory of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and
to the ages of ages.
