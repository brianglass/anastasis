there will be a remnant in Sion and a remnant in Jerusalem, they will
all be called Â‘HolyÂ’ who are inscribed for life in Jerusalem. Because

cleanse the blood of Jerusalem[[\[1\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference

Jerusalem, and people[[\[5\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference

I shall take out its hedge, and it will be for plundering; and I shall
pull down its wall, and it will be for trampling under foot. And I will
abandon my vineyard, and it will not be pruned or dug; and thorns will
come up on it, as on fallow land; and I shall command the clouds not to
shower rain on it. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of
Israel, and a man of Juda the beloved plant.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;

Cain brought from the fruits of the earth a sacrifice to the Lord. And
Abel also brought from the firstborn of his sheep and of his fatlings.
And God look upon Abel and upon his gifts; while he did not regard Cain

Lord God said to Cain, Â‘Why have you become very sorrowful, and why has
your face fallen? If you offered correctly but did not divide correctly,
did you not sin? Be still; his recourse shall be to you, and you shall

know understanding. For I give you a good gift, do not forsake my law.
For I too was a son obedient to my father and beloved in the sight of my
mother. They taught me and said: Let our word be fixed in your heart,
keep the commandments, do not forget, do not neglect the speech of my
mouth, do not forsake it, and it will cling to you; love it, and it will
watch over you. Trench it about and it will exalt you; honour it, that
it may embrace you, that it may bestow on your head a crown of graces,
may shield you with a crown of delight. Hear, my son, and accept my
words, and years of life will be multiplied for you, that ways of life
may become many for you. For I teach you ways of wisdom, I make you go
up on right tracks. For if you journey, your steps will not be
straitened; while if you run, you will not toil. Grasp my instruction;
do not let it go, but guard it for yourself for your life. Do not enter
the ways of the ungodly, do not imitate the ways of transgressors. In
whatever place they pitch camp, do not enter there; keep away from them
and pass by. For they cannot sleep unless they have done evil; sleep has
been taken from them and they do not
slumber[[\[9\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference

bread is the bread of ungodliness, while they are drunk with lawless
wine. But the ways of the just shine like light; they advance and give
light until the day is established. The ways of the ungodly are dark,
they do not know how they stumble. My son, attend to my speech, apply
your ear to my words. So that your springs may not fail you, guard them
in your heart. For there is life for those who find them, and healing
for all flesh.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;

Israel, and the people of Juda the beloved plant. I waited for it to
produce judgement, but it produced iniquity, and not justice, but a cry.
Woe to those who join house to house, and who bring field close to
field, that they may remove something of their neighbourÂ’s! Will you
alone dwell on the land? For these things have been heard by the ears of
the Lord of hosts. For though many houses come into being, great and
fair, they will become a desert, and there will be no inhabitants in
them. For where ten yoke of oxen work, it will produce one jar-full; and
the one who sows twelve bushels will produce one. Woe to those who rise
in the morning and go after strong drink, staying until late; for the
wine will heat them; for with harp and psaltery and drums and flutes
they drink wine, while they do not regard the works of the Lord, and
they do not keep in mind the works of his hands. Therefore my people has
become a prisoner, through not knowing the Lord; and has become a
multitude of corpses, through famine and thirst for water. And Hell has
broadened its soul[[\[10\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference

yourself from the Lord your God in the height or in the depth. And Achaz
said: I shall not ask, nor shall I tempt the Lord. And he said: Hear

Attach them to your soul continually and hang then like a chain round
your neck. When you walk, lead it along and let it be with you; when you
sleep let it guard you, that it may talk with you when you wake. Because
a commandment of the law is a lamp and a light, a way of life and
reproof and instruction to keep you from an unmarried woman and from the
calumny of a strange tongue. Let not desire for beauty conquer you, and
do not be trapped by your eyes, nor captivated by her eyelids; for the
value of a harlot is that of one loaf; while a woman hunts for the
precious souls of men. Will anyone bind fire in his bosom without
burning his clothes? Or will anyone tread on fire without burning his
feet? So is one who goes in to an unmarried woman; he will not be held
guiltless, nor will anyone who touches her. It is not remarkable if some
one is caught stealing; for he steals to fill his soul when he is
hungry; but if he is caught he will repay sevenfold and deliver himself

brings destruction on his soul; he bears pains and dishonours, and his

The Hebrew is using the word in its Â‘literalÂ’ sense of Â‘throatÂ’, but
LXX has misunderstood this. So have the Vulgate and the AV. In Hebrew
all the pronouns are feminine and refer to
Sheol.]{style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

The Hebrew simply has, Â‘And Cain said to his brother AbelÂ’, but the
LXX is supported by the Syriac, the Samaritan, the Vulgate and the
Targums. AVÂ’s Â‘And Cain talked with AbelÂ’ is an attempt to disguise
the problem in the

LXX takes the noun Â‘her endÂ’ as an adverb, and hence has no noun for
the next clauses to refer to, but the adjectives are neuter, not

The Hebrew again plays on the name, which one could reproduce in English

The Triodion, like the Alexandrinus and the corrector of the Sinaiticus,
omits the negative in this sentence. The pious baronetÂ’s note should be

Note the song of the Seraphim, in the biblical text, is in the third
person. Since Â‘LordÂ’ represents the proper name YHWH, many scholars
take Â‘SabaothÂ’ as a divine title. The same is true of the Fathers and
the liturgical texts. The usual LXX translation is Â‘almightyÂ’, in
Greek Â‘PantocratorÂ’, but the Isaiah translator keeps the Hebrew word.
The Hebrew word means Â‘armiesÂ’, either the armies of Israel, or the
heavenly hosts, angels, stars and so forth, though its meaning in the
divine title YHWH Sabaoth is less
certain.]{style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

This word, *lavis*, which is singular in Greek, is the one used for the
spoon with which Communion is given. The word does not mean Â‘spoonÂ’.
It is used in this way with direct reference to this verse of Isaias,

Communion.]{style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}
