AT THE LITI

****

Idiomel Stichera
Tone 1. By Monk John

Let heaven and earth today prophetically be glad. Let us, Angels and mortals, spiritually keep festival, for God has appeared in flesh, born from a woman, to those who sit in darkness and shadow. A cave and a manger have received him. Shepherds proclaim him. Magi from the East bring gifts in Bethlehem, while with unworthy lips let us bring him praise, as we sing, like the Angels, Â‘Glory to God in the highest and peace on earthÂ’; for the expectation of the nations has come. He has come, he has saved us from the slavery of the foe.

****

Same Tone. Same author.

Heaven and earth have been made one today, now that Christ is born. Today God has come upon earth, and humanity gone up to heaven. Today for humankind the One who by nature is unseen is seen. Therefore let us too give glory as we cry to him, Â‘Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth, with which your Coming has rewarded us. Our Saviour, glory to you!Â’

****

Same Tone. Same author.

Â‘Glory to God in the highestÂ’, I hear in Bethlehem today, sung by the Bodiless Powers, to the One who has been well-pleased for there to be peace on earth. Now the Virgin is wider than the heavens; for light has dawned for those in darkness, and has exalted the lowly, who like the Angels sing, Â‘Glory to God in the highest!Â’

****

The same.

When he saw that the one in his image and likeness had fallen away through transgression, Jesus bowed the heavens and came down and made his dwelling in a virgin womb without change, that in it he might refashion corrupted Adam as he cried, Â‘Glory to your epiphany, my Redeemer and my God!Â’

Glory.

**Tone 5.
By Monk John.**

Magi, Persian Kings, having clearly learnt that the heavenly King had been born on earth, drawn by a bright star arrived in Bethlehem, bringing chosen gifts, gold and incense and myrrh. And falling down they worshipped, for they saw lying in the Cave the Timeless as a babe.

Both now.

**Tone 6.
By Germanos.**

All the Angels in heaven dance and rejoice today, while all creation leaps for joy for the Saviour Lord who has been born in Bethlehem; because all the error of idols has ceased and Christ reigns to the ages.

****

At the Aposticha, Idiomel Stichera.
By Germanos. Tone 2.

A great and mighty wonder has been accomplished today! A Virgin gives birth and her womb suffers no corruption; the Word takes flesh and is not separated from the Father. Angels with Shepherds give glory, and we cry out with them, Â‘Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth!Â’

****

Verse:

The Lord said to my Lord, Â‘Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feetÂ’.

Today the Virgin gives birth to the Maker of all. Eden offers a cave and a star reveals Christ, the Sun, to those in darkness. Enlightened by faith, the Magi worship with gifts, and Shepherds see the wonder, while Angels sing in praise and say, Â‘Glory to God in the highest!Â’

****

Verse:

From the womb before the morning star I have begotten you. ****

The same. By Anatolios.

When the Lord Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, Magi came from the East and worshipped God become man. Eagerly opening their treasures, they offered precious gifts, refined gold, as to the King of the ages, and incense, as to the God of all things; while as to one dead for three days, myrrh to the Immortal. Come all you nations, let us worship the One who was born to save our souls.

Glory.

**Tone 4.
By Monk John.**

Jerusalem be glad and all you who love Sion keep festival. Today the ancient bond of AdamÂ’s condemnation has been loosed; Paradise has been opened for us and the serpent vanquished, for he now sees that the one he trampled on of old has become the Mother of the Creator. O the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God! The one who was the cause of death for all flesh, the instrument of sin, has, through the Mother of God, become the source of salvation for all the world. For a child, is born from her, the All-perfect God, and through his birth he seals her Virginity, loosing the bonds of sins through swaddling clothes; and through his becoming a child, he heals the pangs of Eve in childbirth. Therefore let all creation dance and leap for joy, for Christ has come to call it back and to save our souls.

Both now.

**The same.
By Anatolios.**

Your made you dwelling in a cave, Christ our God, a manger received you, while Shepherds and Magi worshipped you. Then was the proclamation of the Prophets fulfilled; and the Angelic Powers marvelled, as they cried out and said, Â‘Glory to your condescension, only lover of humankind!Â’

****

Apolytikion. Tone 4.

Your Nativity, Christ our God, has made the light of knowledge dawn on the world, for by it those who adored the stars were taught by a star to worship you, the Sun of justice, and to know you the Dayspring from on high. Lord, glory to you!
