Blessed are you, and it will be well with you.

May the Lord bless you from Sion, and may you see the good things of
Jerusalem all the days of your life.

Glory to you, our God, glory to you.

Lord, have mercy. ****

The Priest says the following Prayer aloud:

God most pure, Author of all creation, through your love for mankind you
transformed the rib of our forefather Adam into a woman and blessed them
saying, ‘Increase and multiply and have dominion over the earth’, and
declared them both to be one through wedlock, ‘for because of this a man
will abandon his father and mother and be attached to his own wife, and
the two shall become one flesh’ and ‘those whom God has joined together,
let no human separate’.  
You blessed your servant Abraham and opened Sara’s womb, making him the
father of many nations.  
You gave Isaac to Rebecca and blessed her offspring.  
You joined Jacob with Rachel and from him revealed the Twelve
Patriarchs.  
You yoked together Joseph and Aseneth and gave them as the fruit of
their union Ephraim and Manassee.  
You accepted Zachary and Elisabeth and declared their offspring to be
the Forerunner.  
You made the Ever-Virgin spring from the root of Jesse according to the
flesh, and from her you became incarnate and were born for the salvation
of the human race.  
Through your ineffable gift and great goodness you were present in Cana
of Galilee and blessed the marriage there, to show that lawful wedlock
and the begetting of children that comes from it is your will.

All-holy Master, accept the entreaty of us, your suppliants, and, as you
were present there, be present here also with your invisible protection.

Bless this marriage and grant to these servants of yours,

**N**. and **M**., a peaceful life, length of days, chastity, love for
each other in the bond of peace, long-lived offspring, grace in their
children and an unfading crown of glory.  
Grant that they may see their children’s children.  
Preserve their marriage bed unassailed.  
Give them of the dew of heaven from on high and of the richness of the
earth.  
Fill their houses with wheat, wine and oil and every good thing, so that
they may also share them with those in need.

Grant also to those here with them all their requests that are for
salvation. Because you are a God of mercy and compassion and love for
humankind, and to you we give glory, together with your Father who has
no beginning, and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and
for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy. ****

The Priest says the following prayer out loud:

Blessed are you, Lord our God, sacred Celebrant of the mystical and most
pure marriage, Lawgiver of bodily marriage, Guardian of incorruption,
loving Steward of our livelihood. In the beginning, Master, you
fashioned man and established him as king of creation, and said, ‘It is
not good for man to be alone on the earth. Let us make him a helper like
himself.’ And taking one of his ribs you fashioned a woman. When Adam
saw her he said, ‘Now this is bone from my bones and flesh from my
flesh. She will be called ‘woman’ because she was taken from her man.
For this reason a man will leave behind his father and mother and be
joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’. And ‘Those whom
God has joined together, let no human separate’. Now, Master, Lord our
God, send down your heavenly grace also on these servants of yours,

**N**. and **M**., and grant that this handmaid of yours may be subject
in all things to her husband and that this servant of yours may be the
head of his wife, so that they may live in accordance with your will.

Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Abraham and Sara.  
Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Isaac and Rebecca.  
Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Jacob and all the Patriarchs.  
Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Joseph and Aseneth. Bless them,
Lord our God, as you blessed Moses and Sepphora. Bless them, Lord our
God, as you blessed Joachim and Anna.  
Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Zachary and Elisabeth.

Preserve them, Lord our God, as you preserved Noë in the Ark. Preserve
them, Lord our God, as you preserved Jonas in the belly of the whale.  
Preserve them, Lord our God, as you preserved the three holy Youths from
the fire, by sending down on them dew from heaven.

And let the joy come upon them that the blessed Helen had when she found
the precious Cross.

Remember them, Lord our God, as you remembered Enoch, Sem and Elias.  
Remember them, Lord our God, as you remembered the holy Forty Martyrs,
sending down on them crowns from heaven.  
Remember also, Lord our God, the parents who have brought them up, for
the prayers of parents make firm the foundations of households.  
Remember, Lord our God, your servants the groomsmen and bridesmaids, who
have come together to share this joy.  
Remember, Lord our God, your servant

**N**. and your servant **M**., and bless them.

Give them the fruit of the womb, fair offspring, concord of soul and
body.  
Exalt them like the cedars of Lebanon, like a well-cultured vine.  
Grant then rich harvest, so that, having all sufficiency for themselves,
they may overflow into every good work that is also well-pleasing to
you, and that they may see their children’s children like newly planted
olive trees all around their table. And, having been well pleasing to
you, may they shine like beacons in heaven, in you our Lord, to whom
belong all glory might, honour and worship, now and for ever, and to the
ages of ages.

****

Singers:

Amen.

**Deacon: Let us pray to the Lord.**

**Singers: Lord, have mercy.**

****

And again the Priest says the following prayer aloud:

Holy God, who fashioned man from dust, and from his rib built up a woman
and yoked her to him as a helper like himself, for it was not pleasing
to your greatness for man to be alone on earth, do you, Master, now send
forth your hand from your holy dwelling, and link \[

**Here the Priest joins their right hands.**\] your servant N. and your
servant M., because it is by you that a wife is linked to her husband.
Yoke them together in likeness of mind. Crown them into one flesh. Grant
them fruit of the womb, enjoyment of fair offspring. For yours is the
might, and yours the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
****

People:

Amen. ****

The Priest takes the Crowns  
and first crowns the Bridegroom, saying:

The servant of God,

**N**., takes as his crown the servant of God, **M**., in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. ****

He says this three times  
as he makes the sign of the Cross on each of them.

Then the Priest crowns the Bride, saying:

The servant of God,

**M**., takes as her crown the servant of God, **N**., in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. ****

He says this three times  
as he makes the sign of the Cross on each of them.

Then he places the crowns on the heads of the Bride and Groom, chanting
three times:

Lord our God, crown them with honour and glory.

B

rethren, give thanks at all times for all things to God the Father in
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, making yourselves subject to one
another in the fear of Christ. Wives be subject to your own husbands as
to the Lord, because the husband is head of the wife, as Christ too is
head of the Church, and he is the Saviour of the body. But as the Church
is subject to Christ, so wives must be also to their own husbands in
everything. Husbands love your own wives, as Christ loved the Church and
gave himself for her, that he might sanctify her, having purified her
with the washing of water with a word, that he might present the Church
to himself glorious, without spot or wrinkle or anything similar, but
that she might be holy and unblemished. Thus husbands must love their
own wives like their own bodies. One who loves his own wife loves
himself, for no one hates their own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes
it, as the Lord does the Church, because we are members of his body,
from his flesh and from his bones. ‘For this reason a man will abandon
his father and mother and be attached to his wife, and the two shall
become one flesh.’ This is a great mystery, I mean concerning Christ and
the Church. However let each one of you love his wife as himself, and
let the wife respect her husband. ****

A

t that time, there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of
Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the
marriage. When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, ‘They have
no wine’. Jesus said to her. ‘Woman, why do you trouble me? My hour has
not yet come.’ His mother said to the servants, ‘Whatever he tells you,
do it.’ Now there were six stone water jars standing there for the
Jewish ritual of purification, holding twenty or thirty gallons each.
Jesus said to the servants, ‘Fill the jars with water.’ And they filled
them to the brim. He said to them, ‘Now draw some out, and take it to
the chief steward of the feast. They took it. When the chief steward
tasted the water that had become wine and did not know where it had come
from — but the servants who had drawn the water knew — he summoned the
bridegroom and said to him, ‘Everyone puts out the good wine first, and
when people are drunk, then he puts out the worse. But you have kept the
good wine until now.’ This was the beginning of the signs that Jesus did
in Cana of Galilee and he manifested his glory and his disciples
believed in him. ****

Singers:

Glory to you, Lord, glory to you.

Deacon: Let us all say, with all our soul and with all our mind, let us
say.

****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy.

Deacon: Lord almighty, the God of our fathers, we pray you, hear and
have mercy.

****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy.

Deacon: Have mercy on us, O God, according to your great mercy, we pray
you, hear and have mercy.

****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy. **Three times.**

Deacon: Again we pray for mercy, life, peace, health, salvation,
visitation, pardon and forgiveness of sins for the servants of God,

**N**. and **M**., and for the people here present, who await your great
and rich mercy. ****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy. **Three times.**

Priest (Aloud)

For you, O God, are merciful, and love mankind, and to you we give
glory, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and
to the ages of ages.

****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy. ****

The Priest says this prayer:

Lord, our God, who in your saving dispensation were pleased in Cana of
Galilee to declare marriage honourable by your presence, now too
preserve in peace and concord your servants,

**N**. and **M**., whom you have been well-pleased to be joined to each
another. Declare their marriage honourable; keep their marriage bed
undefiled; be well pleased for their life together to be without spot;
and grant that they may reach a ripe old age, carrying out your
commandments with a pure heart.

For you are our God, a God who has and who saves, and to you we give
glory, together with your Father who has no beginning, and your
all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the
ages of ages.

****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Deacon:

Help us, save us, have mercy on us and keep us, O God, by your grace.
****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy.

**Deacon: That the whole day may be perfect, holy, peaceful and sinless,
let us ask of the Lord.**

****

Singers:

Grant this, O Lord. And so after each of the following petitions. ****

Deacon:

An angel of peace, a faithful guide, a guardian of our souls and bodies,
let us ask of the Lord.

Pardon and forgiveness of our sins and offences, let us ask of the Lord.

Things good and profitable for our souls, and peace for the world, let
us ask of the Lord.

That we may live out the rest of our days in peace and repentance, let
us ask of the Lord.

A Christian end to our life, painless, unashamed and peaceful, and a
good defence before the dread judgement seat of Christ, let us ask.

Having asked for the unity of the faith and the communion of the Holy
Spirit, let us entrust ourselves and one another and our whole life to
Christ, our God.

****

Singers:

To you, O Lord. ****

Priest (aloud):

And count us worthy, Master, with boldness and without condemnation to
dare to call upon you, the God of heaven, as Father, and to say: ****

People:

Our Father in heaven,/ may your name be hallowed,/ your kingdom come,/
your will be done/ on earth as in heaven./ Give us today our daily
bread,/ and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;/ and do not
lead us into temptation,/ but deliver us from the evil one.

****

Priest (aloud):

For yours is the Kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Priest:

Peace to all. ****

Singers:

And to your spirit. ****

Deacon:

Let us bow our heads to the Lord. ****

Singers:

To you, O Lord. ****

The common Cup is offered.

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy. ****

The Priest, blessing the Cup, says this prayer:

O God, who made all things by your strength, who made the inhabited
world firm and adorned the crown of all that had been made by you, bless
too with your spiritual blessing this common Cup, which you grant to
those who have been joined in the communion of marriage.

For blessed is your name and glorified your kingdom, of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Then the Priest, taking the Cup in his hands, gives them to drink from
it three times; first to the husband and then to the wife, as he chants
in the 1st Tone:

I will take the cup of salvation and I will call on the name of the
Lord.

****

And the Priest at once takes them, while the Best man holds the crowns
behind and over them, and leads them in a circle round the table three
times.

Meanwhile the Singers chant the following Troparia.

****

Tone 5.

Isaias dance: the Virgin has conceived and given birth to a Son,
Emmanuel, who is both God and man. Orient is his name, whom we magnify
as we call the Virgin blessed.

****

Tone 7.

Holy Martyrs, who fought the good fight and were crowned, intercede with
the Lord to have mercy on our souls.

Glory to you, Christ God, boast of Apostles, joy of Martyrs whose
preaching was the consubstantial Trinity.

****

Then the Priest raises the crowns.  
First that of the Groom, saying:

Bridegroom, be magnified like Abraham, blessed like Isaac and multiplied
like Jacob, as you go your way in peace and carry out in righteousness
the commandments of God.

****

Then that of the Bride, saying:

And you, Bride, be magnified like Sara, and rejoice like Rebecca and be
multiplied like Rachel, rejoicing in your own husband, keeping the
limits of the law, for so God has been well-pleased.

****

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy. ****

And the Priest says this prayer:

God, our God, who were present in Cana of Galilee, and blessed the
marriage there, bless these servants of yours also, who by your
providence have been joined in the communion of marriage. Bless their
goings out and their comings in. Fill their life with good things. Take
up their crowns \[**Here the Priest takes the crowns from the heads of
the couple and places them on the table\] in your Kingdom, unspotted and
unblemished, and keep them without offence to the ages of ages.**

****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Priest:

Peace to all. ****

Singers:

And to your spirit. ****

Deacon:

Bow your heads to the Lord. ****

Singers:

To you, O Lord. ****

The Priest prays:

May Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the all-holy, consubstantial Trinity,
origin of life, the one Godhead and Kingship, bless you and grant you
long life, fair offspring, progress in life and faith, and fill you with
every good thing on earth, and count you worthy of the promised good
things of the enjoyment \[of heaven\], at the prayers of the Mother of
God and of all the Saints.

****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Glory to you, Christ God, our hope, glory to you. ****

Glory to the Father, and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit,  
both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Priest

May he who by his presence at Cana declared marriage honourable, Christ
our true God, through the prayers of his all-pure Mother, of the holy,
glorious and all-praised Apostles, of the holy Sovereigns crowned by God
and Equals of the Apostles, Constantine and Helen, of the holy great
Martyr Prokopios and all the Saints, have mercy on us and save us, for
he is good and loves mankind.

Through the prayers of our holy fathers Lord Jesus Christ our God have
mercy on us.

**PRAYER FOR THE UNTYING OF CROWNS

Lord our God, who blessed the crown of the year and granted that the
present crowns be placed on those who are joined with one another by the
law of marriage and apportion to them, as it were, the reward of chaste
living, for those who have been joined together in the marriage which

RULINGS ON SECOND MARRIAGES

Ruling of Nikephoros, Patriarch of Constantinople, the Confessor.

One who marries for a second time is not crowned, but is forbidden to
partake of the most pure Mysteries for two years; but one who marries
for a third time for five.

From the answers of the blessed Niketas,  
Metropolitan of Herakleia,  
to the questions of Bishop Constantine.

Strictness did not permit those who married for a second time to be
crowned, and the custom of the Great Church does not disregard such
things, but nevertheless bestows marriage crowns on those who marry for
a second and on those who do so for a third time. They are however
forbidden to receive Holy Communion for one or two years. But the Priest
who has celebrated their wedding is not allowed to dine with them, in
accordance with the 7th canon of the Synod of Neoceasarea.

pardon the offences of your suppliants, calling them to repentance,
granting them pardon of faults, mercy for sins, forgiveness of offences,
voluntary and involuntary. You, our Fashioner and Creator, who know the
weakness of human nature; who pardoned Rahab the harlot and accepted the
Publican’s repentance, do not remember our sins of ignorance since our
youth. If you, Lord, should mark iniquities: O Lord, who will stand?
What flesh will be justified in your presence? For you alone are just,
without sin, holy, great in mercy, great in compassion and repent over
the sins of humankind. Do you, Master, who have made your servants,
**N.** and ****M****, your own, unite them to each other with love. Give
them the repentance of the Publican, the tears of the Harlot, the
confession of the Thief, so that, through repentance from their whole
heart, practising your commandments in harmony and peace, they may be
found worthy of your heavenly kingdom.

The Priest prays:

Lord Jesus Christ, who were lifted up on the precious and life-giving
Cross, tore up the record against us and delivered us from the dominion
of the devil, be merciful to the iniquities of your servants, because
they, unable to bear the heat and burden of the day and the burning
fever of the flesh, are now entering together the communion of a second
marriage, as you made it lawful through the Apostle Paul, your vessel of
election, saying for the sake of us in our lowliness, ‘It is better to
marry in the Lord, than to burn’. As you are good and love mankind, have
mercy, pardon, show pity, remit, forgive our debts, for you took our
sicknesses on your own shoulders, for no one is sinless or without
stain, not even were their life but one day, but you alone, who wore
flesh without sin and granted us eternal dispassion.

For you are God, God of those who repent, and to you we give glory,
Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy. ****

And the Priest says the prayer:

Holy God, who fashioned man from the dust**…**

Then the Crowning follows and the rest of the service for a first
marriage.

-----

SERVICE FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE MARRIAGE  
OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DIVORCED

Deacon:

Master, give the blessing. ****

Priest:

Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
****

People:

Amen. ****

Then the following verses, after each of which the Singers chant:  

Glory to you, Lord, glory to you\!

Blessed is one who fears the Lord, for God is great and fearful over all
those who surround him.

The Lord will preserve his mercy for ever and his covenant is sure.

Glory and riches are in his house; for the hand of the Lord will help
him and his arm strengthen him.

You wife like a fruitful vine on the sides of your house. Your children
like newly planted olive trees all around your table.

May the Lord bless you from Sion, and may you see the good things of
Jerusalem all the days of your life.

Blessed be the name of the Lord, from this time forth and for ever more.

****

Deacon:

In peace, let us pray to the Lord. ****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy. **And so after each petition.**

Deacon:

For the peace from on high and for the salvation of our souls, let us
pray to the Lord.

For the peace of the whole world, for the welfare of the holy Churches
of God, and for the union of all, let us pray to the Lord.

For our Archbishop **N.**, for the honoured order of presbyters, for the
diaconate in Christ, for all the clergy and the people, let us pray to
the Lord.

For the servants of God, **N.** and **M.**, who are being reunited in
marriage, and for them to be granted a life without reproach, without
blame, without condemnation, let us pray to the Lord.

For them to be granted a life together in concord, peace and love,
progress in good works and length of days, let us pray to the Lord.

For their and our deliverance from all affliction, wrath, danger and
constraint, let us pray to the Lord.

Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by your grace.

Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most blessed and glorious Lady, Mother
of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, with all the Saints, let us entrust
ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God.

****

Singers:

To you, O Lord. ****

Priest (aloud):

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy. ****

The Priest says the following Prayer

Master, lover of mankind, King of the ages and Creator of all things,
who destroyed the middle wall of enmity and granted peace to the human
race, we pray and implore you, look on your servants, **M.** and **N.**,
pour your blessing upon them. Restore the peace that had been troubled
and plant in their hearts love for each other. Bestow richly on them
spiritual calm and life unassailed, so that, having lived out their days
in calm of soul, they may enjoy your own good things and glorify you,
alone God of love and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom belong
all glory, honour and worship, now and for ever, and to the ages of
ages.

****

Singers:

Amen. ****

And then the usual Dismissal

Priest:

Glory to you, Christ God, our hope, glory to you. ****

Reader:

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now
and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen. Lord, have mercy. Lord,
have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Father, give the blessing. ****

Priest:

May Christ our true God, through the prayers of his all-pure and holy
Mother, by the power of the precious and life-giving Cross, through the
protection of the honoured, Bodiless Powers of heaven, through the
intercessions of the honoured, glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist,
John, of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles, of the holy,
glorious and triumphant Martyrs, of our venerable and God-bearing
Fathers and Mothers, of the holy, glorious and triumphant Great Martyr
Prokopios, of the holy and righteous forebears of God, Joachim and Anna,
and of all the Saints, have mercy on us and save us, for he is good and
loves mankind.

Through the prayers of our holy fathers, Lord Jesus Christ, our God,
have mercy upon us.

****

People:

Amen. ****
