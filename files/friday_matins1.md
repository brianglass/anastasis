<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">The godlike Children did not wor­ship creation instead of the Creator, but bravely trampling on the threat of fire, rejoicing they sang: O highly exalted Lord and God of our fathers, blessed are you! </span>

**Troparia.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">The enemy was routed and thrown headlong as a corpse, when Christ was raised on the tree and he who of old was condemned was saved and cried to him: O Lord and God of our fathers, blessed are you!. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">By dying on a tree you made me, who was slain through a tree, divine, and by your divine wounds you healed the wounds of my heart. O highly exalted Lord and God of our fathers, blessed are you! </span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Martyrs of Christ, your bodies were disfigured, struck by countless scourges, but the beauty of your souls was shown to be truly lovelier, as you cried: O Lord God, blessed are you! </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Shipwrecked in your blood the enemy with his myriads was destroyed; but you, all-honoured Martyrs, sang out with joy: O Lord and God of our fa­thers, blessed are you! </span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">All-pure One, you were shown to be a spotless Bride, a palace for the Creator, a throne formed of fire, earth untilled; therefore we cry to you: Hail Sovereign Lady who made mortals divine by your divine child-bearing. </span>

**Of the Mother of God. Another Ir­mos.**

<span style="color:windowtext">\[<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">You saved in the fire your Youths, of Abraham’s line, and destroyed the Chaldaeans with the snare with which they had unjustly trapped the just. O Lord highly exalted, the God of our Fathers, blessed are you.\] </span></span>

**Troparia.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">The Word who was in the beginning dwelling in your womb, O Virgin, took flesh, calling us back who were imprisoned, he the Lord who loves mankind, the blessed God of our fa­thers. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">You appeared as the spiritual Gate of the Dayspring from on high who ap­peared for mankind on earth from you, O Bride of God, beyond reason and understanding, he the blessed God of our fathers. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Clothed in a robe of many virtues you stood at the right hand of the King of all who became incarnate from your blood, O Bride without bridegroom, who intercede unceasingly that we be delivered from every constraint. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">By your mother’s boldness, O Virgin, break the chains of the offences of those who sing with devotion and love to your Offspring: O highly ex­alted Lord and God of our fathers, blessed are You! </span>

**Ode 8. Irmos.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">The Offspring of the Mother of God saved the innocent Youths in the fur­nace. Then he was prefigured, but now in reality he gathers the whole world which sings: All you works praise the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages. </span>

**Troparia.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Master beyond time, you loose me from timeless bonds, becoming sub­ject to time and given up of your own will and banishing the proud foe in indissoluble bonds, and you save me by your Cross and Passion: therefore I bless you, O Christ, to all the ages. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">O Word, highly exalted, without be­ginning, invisible, you were willingly raised on the Cross, raising all crea­tion with you and making a spectacle of all the principalities and powers of darkness, O Christ, by your Passion; therefore we praise you to all the ages. </span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Martyrs of all the world, you mounted your own blood like a chariot and were carried to dwellings above the world, receiving fitting prizes from Christ, and crying: Praise the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Raised on gallows and hurled into pits, thrown to beasts and torn apart by fire and water the victorious Mar­tyrs sang with joy: You works praise the Lord and highly exalt him to all the ages. </span>

**Cross-Theotokion.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">When she saw you sleeping on the Tree, who grant divine and saving awakening to all, your all-pure Mother loudly lamenting cried out: What is this newest wonder? He who gives life to all is dying willingly. </span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">**Of the Mother of God. The same Irmos.** </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">The Creator, who is unapproachable by all the ranks above, dwelt in your womb, keeping you unharmed by fire and incorrupt after child-birth; to him we now cry out: You works praise the Lord and highly exalt him to all the ages. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Pure of stains and taints and a shrine of all holiness you bore the all-holy Word, who makes all things holy and is without beginning with the Father; therefore, O Virgin, we praise and highly exalt you to all the ages. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Knowing you by mouth and mind to be Mother of God we confess you, O immaculate; for you gave birth, all-pure, to the Creator clothed in flesh, Christ the Lord and King; therefore, O Virgin, we praise and highly exalt you to all the ages. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">O Mother of God, the all-holy Ark, overshadowed by the divine Spirit, who bore the eternal and everlasting Word, who through ineffable com­passion became incarnate, we praise and highly exalt you to all the ages. </span>

**Ode 9. Irmos.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Let all born of earth bearing torches, in spirit leap for joy; let the nature of the immaterial spirits hon­our and celebrate the wondrous sa­cred festival of the Mother of God, and let them cry: Hail, all-blessed Mother of God, pure and Ever-Virgin! </span>

**Troparia.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">He stands judged who is going to judge the universe, O Lover of man­kind; you willingly bind on a crown of thorns, O Saviour, plucking up the thorn of disobedience by the roots, O Christ, and implanting in all the knowledge of your compassion </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Oh how does the unjust people, darkened by envy, betray you to a cross, O just and blameless and Giver of life. Seeing your passion the sun grows dark and the splendour of the Temple is rent and the foundations of the earth are shaken. </span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Holy Martyrs, you are called compan­ions of the sufferings of Christ and fellow heirs of the King­dom and the glory; therefore, O wise ones, give light to those who hymn you, scattering the gloom of sin and manifold disasters. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Already, wise Martyrs, you have made your dwelling in heaven itself, receiving eternal glory and deified by sacred participation in God’s life; remember us all who honour with faith your all-sacred and revered memory, O all-praised. </span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Enlighten, O pure one, those who hymn and magnify you with longing; destroy the darkness of our passions, O Maiden; end the tempest; take from our midst the stumbling blocks of the evil one; subdue the children of Hagar to our devout King by your prayers. </span>

**Of the Mother of God. Another Irmos.**

<span style="color:windowtext">\[<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Eve by the sickness of disobedience gave entrance to the curse; but you, Virgin Mother of God, by the offshoot of your child-bearing made blessing flower for the world; therefore we all magnify you.\]</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Pure Bride of God, the spiritual coal which Isaias saw you carry in your arms, O Mother of God, united with our form and a beacon of salvation for the world; therefore we all mag­nify you. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">The Prophets proclaimed in advance the symbols of your birth-giving, in­structed in these mysteries from afar, and by the divine inspiration of the Spirit proclaiming them loudly to the world; at whose fulfilment we now marvel. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Lovely in his beauty and fairer than all is he fruit of your womb, for you, Virgin Mother of God, gave birth to God incarnate that he might save mankind; therefore we all magnify you. </span>

**Aposticha of Lauds. Of the Cross.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">May your Cross be a wall for us, Jesu our Saviour; for we faithful have no other hope but you who were nailed to it and who grant us your great mercy. </span>

**Model melody.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">You have given as a sign to those who fear you, Lord, your precious Cross, through which you triumphed over the principalities and powers of darkness and brought us back to our ancient blessedness; therefore we glorify your loving dispensation, O Jesu all-powerful, the Saviour of our souls. </span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Who is not amazed, holy Martyrs, seeing the good fight that you fought; how while still in the body you con­quered the bodiless foe, confessing Christ and armed with the Cross? Therefore you were fittingly named routers of demons and enemies of barbarians, as you intercede unceas­ingly that our souls may be saved. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Glory. Both now. <span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Cross Theotokion.</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;
color:red">As noblest of Martyrs. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">When the Virgin, your Mother, saw You hanging on the Cross, O Lord, she was amazed and cried out with yearning: My Son, so well-beloved, why have you been fixed to the tree of the Cross, O Long-suffering One? Why have your hands and feet been nailed by lawless men, O Word? Why have you shed your blood, O Master? </span>

<span style="font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">AT THE LITURGY </span>

<span style="text-transform:uppercase;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">**The Beatitudes** </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Through a tree Adam became an ex­ile from Paradise, but through the Tree of the Cross the Thief made Paradise his home; the one by tasting rejected the commandment of his Maker, the other, crucified with him confessed the hidden God, crying: Remember me in your kingdom. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">The Powers of heaven, at a loss through fear, were amazed seeing you stretched on the Cross, O only Long-suffering; the earth was shaken and the beauty of the great lights was quenched; Adam the condemned was justified when you were judged un­justly, O Lover of mankind, and he praised your loving kindness. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Lifted up on Calvary you destroyed the curse of the foe; by dying on the Tree you gave life to those who had died through the fruit of the tree, O Master, and declared them citizens of Paradise, who ceaselessly sing your praise, Christ our God, and cry to you: Remember us also in your king­dom. </span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Holy Martyrs, having taken up the Cross as a weapon you marched out with noble intent against the ranks of the foe, and having destroyed them you were garlanded with victors’ wreathes and gained glory and divine splendour, O admirable ones; there­fore with faith we all call you blest. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Glory. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">To show your compassion for us openly, O Saviour, who are one with the Father and the Spirit, you were nailed to the Cross; and endured the sponge and reed, blows and stripes, for you wished to deliver from ever-living fire us who cry: Remember us also in your kingdom. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Both now. <span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Theotokion.</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">The wholly uncontainable dwelt without constraint in your holy womb, O Mother of God, immaculate Lady, and by dying on a Tree became a source of life for the world. Implore him to slay our carnal thoughts and save us all as he loves mankind. </span>
