TONE 7

ON SUNDAY EVENIN

G ****

At

Lord, I have cried **Prosomia.**

Tone 7. Today Judas watches.

Lift your eye, my soul, and gaze on the condescension and compassion of God, how, having bowed the heavens, he came upon earth that he might exalt you from the wretchedness of your passions, and stand up on the rock of the faith. Ah, dread wonder! Glory to your self-emptying, Lover of mankind!

Look on your lawless deeds, my soul, and marvel; how can earth support you? How does it not strike you with thunderbolts? How do wild beasts not devour you? But how too did the Sun which never sets and ever shines on you not cease? Rise up, repent, cry out to the Lord: I have sinned against you, I have sinned, have mercy on me!

Having all our hope in you, all-powerful Lord, we implore you to rescue us from dangers of every kind and from the tempest of the passions; so that we may pass our life peacefully, and having lived in purity, may find you kindly and merciful Master, on the day of judgement.

****

Other Stichera of the Bodiless Powers.

The tree of life.

You made your Angels a flame of fire, O Christ, showing to us their burning heat and depicting against the swift spirit. All-powerful Lord, glory to you.

Save us, Lord, by the protection of the Angels; wash away the filth of our offences, wiping out the scars of sin, that we may cry: Lord, glory to you.

The Seraphim, Cherubim, Angels and Powers, Thrones, Principalities, all Dominations with Archangels and radiant Authorities, cry to you: Lord, glory to you.

Glory. Both now*.*

**Theotokion, same melody.**

All nature born of earth cries aloud to you, Mother of God, ‘Hail’, as to her who became cause of their salvation by your giving birth, O Mother of God.

****

Aposticha of Compunction.

Like the Prodigal Son, I too come, O Compassionate. Receive me as I fall down as one of your hired servants, O God, and have mercy on me.

Like the one who fell among thieves and was wounded, so I too have fallen through my sins, and my soul is wounded. To whom shall I, the guilty, flee unless to you the compassionate physician of souls? Pour out upon me, O God, your great mercy.

Glory to you, Christ God, boast of Apostles, joy of martyrs, whose preaching is the consubstantial Trinity.

Glory. Both now*.*

**Theotokion. Today Judas watches.**

You surpassed the ranks of Angels, as you gave a body to God; while I, who have vanquished all in sins, alas! quake and tremble. Therefore I do not dare to call on you for help Sovereign lady, Mother of God. Do not then despise me, but hasten, save me guiding me to the straight way.

ON MONDAY EVENING

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **Prosomia.**

Tone 7. Today Judas watches.

Master and God all-compassionate, by the judgements which you know, grant that my heart may possess your fear, grant that I may love you with my whole soul; grant that I may loathe the deeds of the boaster and do your saving will. For you are our God who said: Ask and you will receive.

I have become the laughing stock of the demons and the shame of mortals, lamentation of the Just, grief of the Angels, pollution of air, land and water, for I have defiled my soul and ruined my mind with outrageous deeds; I have become an enemy to God. Alas, Lord, I have sinned against you, I have sinned, pardon me.

I beseech you, Master, be patient with me, though I bear no fruit, and do not cut me down like the fruitless tree by the felling of death, consigning me to fire. But, I implore you, make me fruitful, giving me time for repentance, as you love mankind, that I may wash away my many sins, O Saviour Christ.

****

Others, of the Forerunner. Having despised.

As escort to the bride with words you led forward the Church of Christ, wise Saint, as an unblemished bride and set her beside the Master as his subject. But as you now have power, defend her and appear as her champion, rescuing her from every wickedness of the devil, O All-blessed.

Shining with spiritual light on my humble soul, O Forerunner, drive far from it all the fog of soul-destroying pleasures and passions of the body. And as you now have power, defend me too, and appear as my protector, rescuing me from every constraint and dread circumstance.

O summit of the Prophets and seal of the Law of types; O holiness greater than all born of earth; O godly Herald and Forerunner of the coming of Christ; O Teacher of repentance; O image of purity: save your servants rescuing us from every constraint and dread circumstance.

Glory. Both now.

Glory. Both now*.*

**Cross-Theotokion.**

****

Others, of the Mother of God. Today Judas watches

Bend your loving ear to me as I implore, All-Blameless, and do not cast me from your presence, not send me far from your help. For by trickery the trickster strives to destroy me; stirs my heart with irrational passions. But do you keep me wholly safe from his harm.

The can no advantage from matter, O my soul, for which you strive for emptiness of life, for which you melt yourself with cares. So cast all your care on the Lord, who is coming to judge you, and cry out with tears: Master who love mankind, save me at the prayers of her who gave you birth.

Having put the name of true devotion right outside me, O Virgin, within I am a plaything of fornication, and despised as a laughing stock of imposture. For through my heedlessness I faced by two wild beasts as opponents. Therefore deliver me, for you are the joy and assurance of my soul.

Glory. Both now*.*

**Cross-Theotokion.**

Once at your birth, my Child, I heard words that bring joy, through which I looked to be filled with joy, and to bring joy to afflicted souls; but these things have been manifestly turned to grief by your crucifixion, grief overcomes me and I would rather die, for grief fills my soul.

Earth, tremble and be shaken, said the All-pure through her tears.

You were known as a Mother beyond nature, O Mother of God; you remained a Virgin beyond reason and understanding; no tongue can expound the marvel of your child-bearing; for while your conceiving, Pure One, was wondrous, the manner of your bearing child cannot be comprehended, for wherever God wills the order of nature is overthrown. Therefore as we all acknowledge you to be Mother of God we implore you insistently: Intercede that our souls may be saved.

Of the Dead.

Verse:

Blessed are those whom you have chosen and taken.

At the beginning you fashioned mankind in your image and likeness, you placed him in Paradise to rule over your creatures; but deceived by the envy of the devil, he shared the food and became a transgressor of your commandments; and so you condemned him to return again to the earth from which he had been taken, Lord, and to ask for rest.

****

Verse:

Their souls will dwell among good things.

Give rest, O Saviour giver of life, to our brothers whom you have translated from temporary things and who cry: Lord, glory to you!

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Daniel saw you as a holy, divine mountain, honoured one, and wise Isaias proclaimed you to be Mother of God, who contained God in flesh who fashioned Adam; the Cherubim tremble at him incarnate, as they hymn and glorify him with the never-silent thrice holy song; but ask him that our souls may be saved.
