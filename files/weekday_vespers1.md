WEEKDAY VESPERS TONE 2
======================

<span style="font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">ON SUNDAY EVENING</span>

<span style="color:red">At</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">Lord, I have cried,</span> <span style="color:red">Prosomia of the Lord.</span>

<span style="color:red">Tone 2. When from the Tree.</span>

Give me the thought of repentance, give too the desire for compunction to my lowly soul; rouse me from the sleep of dread hardness, drive away the darkness of sloth, and banish the fog of despair, that I, poor wretch, may raise my head and cling to you, O Word, and walk in your wishes.

O Christ, alone easy to be entreated, comÂ­passionate Word, alone supremely good and alone forbearing, I fall before you, I fervently implore you; in supÂ­plication I cry to you, Â‘I have sinned, save, save me, the Prodigal,<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[1]</span></a> in your compassion, that with thanksgiving I may cry: Lord, give me pardon, and I shall walk in your goodnessÂ’.

All that I have sinned against you, my God,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in words and deeds and in desires, all I confess, now I tell you all; for I have passed through the day and the whole time, but reached the night, full of wickedness; therefore I fall before you as I cry, Â‘My Master, Master and Saviour, I have sinned, pardon and save meÂ’.

<span style="color:red">Others, of the Bodiless Powers. Same melody.</span>

Come, let us praise in spiritual songs the princes of the Angels, for, as leaders of all the Bodiless choirs, they are both called Chief Captains and Archangels; for Gabriel is ruler of grace,<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[2]</span></a> and the prince of Archangels, Michael, is recognized as comÂ­mander of law and those before Moses.<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[3]</span></a>

Hail, beacon of the Bodiless Powers, hail, Chief Captain of the immaterial choir, initiate and chief messenger of the ineffable mysteries of God, all-blessed Michael, eye-witness of things on high. We entreat you to rescue from all difficulties and dangers those who have recourse to you. For we all present you to the Lord as our kindly defender.

Hail, Captain of the Angels, initiate of ineffable mysteries and minister of God; exalted prince of the Bodiless Choirs, most glorious Gabriel; for you appeared as servant of dread mysteries of the secret, mystical counsel; for you came down to announce to us beforehand for our salvaÂ­tion the supreme condescension of God towards humankind.

<span style="color:red">Aposticha of Compunction.</span>

I have sinned against you, O Saviour, like the Prodigal son, receive me repentant, my Father, and have mercy on me, O God<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[4]</span></a>.

I cry to you, Christ Saviour, with the words of the Publican, Â‘Be merciful to me, as to him, and have mercy on me, O GodÂ’<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[5]</span></a>.

<span style="color:red">Verse 1.</span> To you I lift up my eyes, to you who are enthroned in the heavens. As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master: or as the eyes of a maid toward the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God: until he show us his mercy.

<span style="color:red">Of the Martyrs.</span>

Having no love for earthly enjoyment, the Champions were found worthy of heavenly good things, and have become fellow citizens of Angels. Lord, at their intercessions have mercy and save us.

<span style="color:red">Verse 2. </span>Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we have our fill of derision; our soul has its fill. Mockery for those at ease: and derision for the proud.

<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Glory. Both now.</span> <span style="color:red">Theotokion*.*</span>

Gate mystically sealed, through which none may pass,<a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[6]</span></a> blessed Virgin Mother of God, receive our supplications and bring them to your Son and God, that through you he may save our souls.

<span style="color:red">At</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">Lord, I have cried</span> <span style="color:red">Prosomia of the Lord.</span>

<span style="color:red">Tone 2. When from the Tree.</span>

O Christ, alone without sin, alone forbearing, alone source of goodness, see my constraint, see my affliction and wipe away all the scars of my wounds; and in mercy save your servant; that when I have driven the clouds of despondency far away I may glorify you, my Saviour supremely good.

Look, O my miserable soul, see your deeds, how utterly defiled they are; see your nakedness, alas, and your isolation, for you are about to be parted from God and Angels and cast into unending torment. Be vigilant, rouse yourself, hurry, cry out, Â‘I have sinned, O Saviour, grant me pardon and save meÂ’.

I have dreadfully defiled my body, I have corrupted my soul and heart with foul thoughts; I have wounded all my senses, I have befouled my eyes, stained my ears, polluted my tongue with words, and I possess all that is base. Therefore I fall down before you and cry, Â‘Master Christ, I have sinned, I have sinned. Pardon and save meÂ’.

<span style="color:red">Others of the Forerunner. Same melody.</span>

Hasten, rescue me from temptations, glorious Prophet of the Lord, I implore you; for in vain have the harsh demons who make war on me been moved against me, as they seek to snatch away the soul of your servant like a pitiable sparrow. Do not finally abandon me, but rather let them know that you are my refuge.

All-holy shoot of a barren mother, fair blossom of the wilderness, fair swallow, sweet-voiced nightingale, golden dove, make my ever barren, wretched soul fruitful of good deeds, that it may bring forth a ear that bears a hundredfold,<a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[7]</span></a> blessed Saint, and offer you praise inspired by God.

Deliver me, I implore you, O Forerunner, from eternal fire, darkness without light, constraint and every affliction, every misery, every tribulation, and show me, who am self-condemned by my offences, to have my part with the saved by your prayers, blessed Saint, where the choirs of the saints are found and where there is inexpressible joy.

<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Glory. Both now.</span> <span style="color:red">Theotokion. The same.</span>

Afflictions and dread assaults, and passions of many kinds buffet my miserable soul, Maiden who knew not wedlock, Mother of Christ God. Appear to me as pilot in the sea of life and calm the tempest that assails me, guiding to a calm harbour of repentance one who takes refuge under your divine protection.

<span style="color:red">Aposticha of Compunction.</span>

I have sinned against you, Saviour, like the Prodigal Son. Accept me, Father, as I repent and have mercy on me, O God.<a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[8]</span></a>

I cry to you, Christ Saviour, in the words of the Publican: Be gracious to me as to him, and have mercy on me, O God.<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[9]</span></a>

<span style="color:red">Of the Martyrs.</span>

As the holy Martyrs intercede for us and praise Christ, every error is ended and the human race is saved by faith.

<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Glory. Both now.</span> <span style="color:red">Theotokion.</span>

All my hope I set on you, Mother of life, guard me beneath your protection.

<span style="color:red">At </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">Lord, I have cried,</span> <span style="color:red">we insert Prosomia of the Cross.</span>

<span style="color:red">Tone 2. When from the Tree.</span>

Saviour, when you were nailed to the Cross, the sun, seeing it, was darkened from fear of you and the veil of the Temple was rent, the earth was shaken and the rocks likewise were split apart in terror, not having strength to see their Creator on the Tree, suffering unjustly by his own counsel and mocked by lawless men.<a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[10]</span></a>

The all-evil serpent was utterly cast down to earth, utterly routed and lay a lifeless corpse, when you were lifted up on the Tree, O Lover of mankind. Adam is freed from the curse, and he, before condemned, is saved.<a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[11]</span></a> Therefore, we beg, save us too, take pity on all and make us worthy of your Kingdom.

You accept judgement, only King, who are going to judge the universe at your coming; while you wore a crown of thorns, Saviour, Lover of humankind, by your power plucking out the thorn of deception by the roots, implanting the knowledge of your compassion in all those who sing the praise of your crucifixion.

<span style="color:red">Others, of the Mother of God. When from the Tree.</span>

Wealth of the beggared, delight and refuge of the poor and hope of orphans are you, Sovereign Lady, and we glorify you, crying out in affliction, Â‘Holy of Holies, come now and rescue your servants from all assaults of demons, dread punishment and eternal condemnationÂ’.

Truly the multitudes of my offences engulf my head, Pure Maiden, my iniquities are greatly multiplied and I, wretch and uncorrected, have acquired insupportable and numberless burdens. Therefore, only correction of sinners, by your fervent intercession, come now and save me.

As to a harbour I hasten under your holy protection, pure Virgin Mother, and I beg: have compassion, do not reject me, your servant, but deliver me from my present tribulation, for you are by nature compassionate. Mother of God most high, as you ever intercede, save your servants from troubles.

Glory. Both now.<span style="color:red"> Cross-Theotokion. Same melody.</span>

Pure Virgin, when you saw the ripe grape Cluster<a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[12]</span></a> that you had bore unhusbanded in your womb hanging upon the Tree, lamenting you bewailed him and cried out, Â‘My Child, who drop down sweetness; Benefactor, through whom may all the drunkenness of the passions be abolished by divine consolations, through me who gave you birth, for you are compassionateÂ’.

<span style="color:red">Aposticha of the Cross.</span>

Save me, Christ Saviour, by the power of the Cross, who saved Peter in the sea,<a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[13]</span></a> and have mercy on me, O God.

You have revealed the Tree of your Cross as a tree of life,<a href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[14]</span></a> Christ our God, to us who believe in you; and through it you destroyed the one who held the might of death and made us, who had been slain by sin, alive. And so we cry to you: Benefactor of all, Lord, glory to you.

<span style="color:red">Of the Martyrs.</span>

Choirs of Martyrs stood before the tyrants saying, Â‘We are soldiers for the King of powers. Even if you destroy us by fire and torments, we will not deny the power of the TrinityÂ’.

<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Glory. Both now.</span><span style="color:red"> Cross-Theotokion. When from the Tree.</span>

Having endured many pains by the crucifixion of your Son and God, with tears and lamentations you groaned, O Immaculate, Â‘Alas, my sweetest Child, how do you suffer, wishing to redeem those born of earth from Adam?Â’ Therefore, all-holy Virgin, we entreat you in faith, make him merciful to us.

##### <span style="font-size:18.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ON WEDNESDAY EVENING</span>

<span style="color:red">At </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">Lord, I have cried<span style="color:red">,</span></span> <span style="color:red">Prosomia of the Apostles.</span>

<span style="color:red">Tone 2. When from the Tree.</span>

When the Word had appeared upon earth, godly Apostles, you were seen like trumpets, you made his salvation manifest to all and you gathered peoples to the inspired Faith, laying waste the fortresses of error. Therefore, blessed ones, you have worthily received the honours and crowns of victory.

Companies of Angels, truly rejoicing, clapped their hands on high as they saw the sacred Disciples proclaiming with boldness the incarnation of the Lord and crying out to all, Â‘This is our God, who is before the ages; he has willingly taken flesh, yet he is enthroned with the Father and equal in honour with the SpiritÂ’.

Fishermen of the inhabited world, speedily rescue my soul, caught on the hook by the devices of the foe, and save me now, who am in despair, giving me strength, godly Apostles, to bear fruits of repentance, so that I may not experience the fire of hell, but be found worthy of the Kingdom of heaven.

<span style="color:red">Others of St Nicolas. Same melody.</span>

Surrounded by a multitude of temptations, hemmed in by the waves of life, drowning in a swell of troubles and tossed about by griefs, I place all my hope in you, Father Nicolas; grant me deliverance from all perils by your prayers, blessed Saint, by your entreaties to your Master.

A dark cloud of despair and a fog of misery now hide me, affliction on affliction troubles me, while fear of dangers seizes me. I beg you, save me, blessed of God, for I name you my defender, and send me your help, Father, as I call on you.

Having received grace from God, you give healings to all who have recourse to you beneath your protection, holy Nicolas. For you put to flight the incurable passions of the demons, while by your intercession you heal all. Therefore we also beseech you, intercede with the Lord that those who sing your praise may be rescued from harm

<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Glory. Both now. </span><span style="color:red">Theotokion. The same.</span>

You are the whole strength of our life and our refuge, Immaculate Mother. You are the assistance of all who sing your praise. May those who boast against your servants not count on your protection; for you have been given as protection towards God. Therefore, Sovereign Lady, do not disdain to save your servants.

<span style="color:red">Aposticha of the Apostles.</span>

You have magnified the names of the Princes of the Apostles in the inhabited world, O Saviour. They learned the ineffable mysteries of heaven, they gave healings to those on earth, and their shadows<a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[15]</span></a> alone cured the passions. The one who was a fisherman worked wonders; the one who was a Jew taught the doctrines of grace. Through them, O Compassionate, grant us your great mercy.

We who are warred upon from every side and take refuge in you, who alone are truly God, offer you the words of your Disciples as we say, Â‘Save us, Teacher, we are perishingÂ’.<a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[16]</span></a> Show now also to our enemies, we beg, that you protect your people and, at the intercession of the Apostles, save them from dangers, overlooking their sins through your great goodness. Lord, glory to you.

<span style="color:red">Of the Martyrs.</span>

Great the glory that you gained through faith, O Saints! For not only did you defeat the foe when you suffered, but after death also you drive out spirits; you heal the infirm, O physicians of souls and bodies. Intercede with the Lord to have mercy on our souls.

<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Glory. Both now. </span><span style="color:red">Theotokion. When from the Tree.</span>

You protect all those who with faith take refuge in your mighty hand, loving Lady; for we sinners, bowed down by many faults, have no other constant mediation but you before God in dangers and afflictions, Mother of God most high. Therefore we fall down before you, Â‘Deliver your servants from every disasterÂ’.

Saviour, when you were nailed to the Cross, the sun, seeing it, was darkened from fear of you and the veil of the Temple was rent, the earth was shaken and the rocks likewise were split apart in terror, not having strength to see their Creator on the Tree, suffering unjustly by his own counsel and mocked by lawless men.<a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[17]</span></a>

The all-evil serpent was utterly cast down to earth, utterly routed and lay a lifeless corpse, when you were lifted up on the Tree, O Lover of mankind. Adam is freed from the curse, and he, before condemned, is saved.<a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[18]</span></a> Therefore, we beg, save us too, take pity on all and make us worthy of your Kingdom.<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; letter-spacing: 0pt"> </span>

When, by a Tree, the lawless people, slew you, the life of all, O Saviour, then all creation trembled with fear, the palaces of Hell and the might of death were utterly destroyed by your divine power. Then too Adam the forefather cried out to you with joy, Â‘Glory to your condescension, O Lover of humankindÂ’.

<span style="color:red">Of the Mother of God. Same melody.</span>

Assent to the prayers of your suppliants, Pure Virgin, and grant us springs of tears, that we may wash away the stains of our offences, O All-blameless, and quench the flame of everlasting and most bitter fire. For you fulfil the requests of those who with their whole heart call on you, the Mother of the Master.

Storm-tossed by a tempest of contrary thoughts and by lifeÂ’s waves, borne hither and thither by disordered spirits of the dread ruler of this world,<a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[19]</span></a> I cry to you, O Virgin, Â‘Hasten to rescue me from the dangers that hold me fastÂ’, so that with a thankful heart I may proclaim your mighty deeds to all the faithful, O Full of GodÂ’s grace.

Pure Sovereign Lady, see my weakness and the misery of my wretched soul and the affliction of my heart, and scatter the counsels of invisible foes, who assail me and make fearful war on me. For you, who gave birth to God, can grant redemption to those in mortal dangers.

<span style="color:red">Aposticha of the Cross.</span>

Save me, Christ Saviour, by the power of the Cross, who saved Peter in the sea,<a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[20]</span></a> and have mercy on me, O God.

You have revealed the Tree of your Cross as a tree of life,<a href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[21]</span></a> Christ our God, to us who believe in you; and through it you destroyed the one who held the might of death and made us, who had been slain by sin, alive. And so we cry to you: Benefactor of all, Lord, glory to you.

<span style="color:red">Of the Martyrs.</span>

The Champions did not long for earthly pleasure and so were found worthy of heavenly good things, and the have become fellow citizens of the Angels. Lord, at their prayers have mercy and save us.

<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Glory. Both now.</span> <span style="color:red">Cross-Theotokion. When from the Tree.</span>

Pure Virgin, when you saw the ripe grape Cluster<a href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[22]</span></a> that you had bore unhusbanded in your womb hanging upon the Tree, lamenting you bewailed him and cried out, Â‘My Child, who drop down sweetness; Benefactor, through whom may all the drunkenness of the passions be abolished by divine consolations, through me who gave you birth, for you are compassionateÂ’.

ON FRIDAY EVENING
-----------------

<span style="color:red">At</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">Lord, I have cried</span><span style="color:red">, Prosomia of the Lord.</span>

<span style="color:red">Tone 2. When from the Tree.</span>

When you come in glory, O Christ, with the holy Angels to judge the universe, when all stand naked before you to give a defence of what they have done, then rank me with your sheep, O Word, granting me release from all the offences, by which in my life I have offended.<a href="#_ftn23" id="_ftnref23"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[23]</span></a>

Tear up the cords of my passions, dry up the putrefaction of my soul, only Lover of mankind, give me tears of compunction, enlighten my darkened heart, rescue me, I pray, from trouble, the storm of hostile disasters and from temptations of many kinds, from the dread foe and ruler of the world.<a href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[24]</span></a>

Consider in your mind, my soul, that most dreaded hour of the judgement, when fear will seize all creation and the Most High takes his seat on the fearful throne to exact an account of all that we have done; hurry, be reconciled to the Judge and cry out: I have sinned against you, Lord, save me!

<span style="color:red">Others, of the Mother of God. Same melody.</span>

Wholly enslaved since my youth to shameful passions and great depravity, I have completely blackened that which is in GodÂ’s image<a href="#_ftn25" id="_ftnref25"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[25]</span></a> and I quail, All-praised Lady, at the judgement to come, when I shall stand before your Son and God. Now therefore, before the end, Pure Virgin, give me cleansing of my passions and redemption of offences.

I tremble at the judgement seat, the eternal penalty of the fire, the sentence, against which there is truly no appeal, the gnashing of teeth<a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[26]</span></a> and the savagery of the worm that does not sleep,<a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[27]</span></a> All-blameless Virgin. Therefore in anguish of heart I implore you to deliver me from the fearful condemnation.

When my soul is about to be forcibly parted from my bodyÂ’s limbs, then stand by my side and scatter the counsels of my bodiless foes and smash the teeth of those who implacably seek to swallow me down, so that I may pass unhindered through the rulers of darkness who wait in the air,<a href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[28]</span></a> O Bride of God.

The shadow of the law<a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[29]</span></a> has passed away now that grace has come, for as the Bush in flames was not burned,<a href="#_ftn30" id="_ftnref30"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[30]</span></a> so as a virgin you bore a child and remained a virgin; instead of a pillar of fire<a href="#_ftn31" id="_ftnref31"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[31]</span></a> the Sun of justice<a href="#_ftn32" id="_ftnref32"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[32]</span></a> has dawned, instead of Moses Christ, the salvation of our souls.

<span style="color:red">Aposticha of the Martyrs.</span>

As the holy Martyrs intercede for us and sing ChristÂ’s praises, all error has ended and the human race is saved by faith.

<span style="color:red">Verse 1:</span> ** God is wonderful in his Saints.

<span style="color:red">Verse 2:</span> For the Saints in his land the Lord has done wonders.

Great is the glory that you have gained through faith, O Saints; for not only did you conquer the foe by suffering, but also after death you drive out spirits, you heal the sick, O physicians of souls and bodies. Intercede with the Lord to have mercy on our souls.

<span style="color:red">Verse 3:</span> Blessed are those whom you have chosen and taken; they will dwell in your courts.
