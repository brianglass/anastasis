**Ode 1. Tone 8. Irmos.**

You fixed the sea, Lord, drowning boastful Pharao with his chariots; you saved the people dry-shod and led them to the mountain of sanctification, as they cried: Let us sing a song of victory to our God, the mighty in wars.

**Troparia.**

Nations clap your hands, Hebrews lament, for Christ the giver of life has torn asunder the chains of Hell, and raised the dead, and healed the sick with a word. This is our God, who gives life to those who believe in his name.

You showed a wonder by changing water into wine, O Master, who changed the rivers of Egypt into blood. And you raised the dead, perfecting this second sign. Glory, O Saviour, to your counsel, glory to your abasement, through which you have made us new.

O Lord, you are an ever-flowing stream of true life, you are our resurrection; willingly you toiled, my Saviour; and as you wished you thirsted, subject to nature’s laws; and coming in the flesh to Sychar you sought water to drink of the woman of Samaria.

Loaves you blessed, fish you multiplied, O God beyond understanding; you satisfied the hunger of peoples without stinting and You promised an ever-flowing spring of wisdom to the thirsty. You, Saviour, are our God, who give life to those who believe in your name.

Glory.

Three I glorify, alike without beginning and alike in majesty: the Father, God without beginning, the Son alike without beginning and the Spirit co-eternal with the Son: one Being in three Persons. I honour in hymns one first Principle beyond beginning of a Godhead and Essence without beginning.

Both now*.* **Theotokion.**

You alone, pure Mother of God, contained your creator in your womb and inexpressibly carried Him in the flesh, and you remained a Virgin, your virginity quite unharmed; beseech him, your Son and God, always and without ceasing on behalf of your flock.

**Ode 3. Irmos.**

My heart has been established in the Lord; my horn has been exalted in my God; my mouth has been enlarged against my foes; I have been glad in my salvation.

**Troparia.**

Do not judge according to appearance, O Jews, said the Master, as he stood teaching in the temple, as it is written, at the mid-point of the feast according to the law.

Do not judge according to appearance, O Jews; for Christ has come, whom the Prophets declared would come from Sion, and call back the world.

If you do not believe the words, O Jews, be convinced by the Master’s works: why do you err, rejecting the Holy One of whom Moses wrote in the Law?

If the Messias must surely come, O Jews, now that Christ the Messias has come, why do you err, and reject the Just One, of whom Moses wrote in the Law?

Glory.

We worship you, Father in Essence without beginning; we hymn your Son alike without beginning, and devoutly praise the all-holy Spirit, as Three, one God by nature.

Both now*.* **Theotokion.**

Being one of the Trinity, you were seen to have become flesh without changing your Essence, Lord, or burning the incorrupt womb of her who bore you, though you are wholly God and fire.

**Ode 4. Irmos.**

The Prophet Avvakum, O Lord, foresaw your coming with the eyes of the mind, and therefore he cried out: God will come from Theman. Glory to you, O Christ, glory to your condescension.

**Troparia.**

If the Messias must come; but the Messias is Christ, lawless ones, why do you not believe him? See, he has come and what he does bears witness: he made water wine and braced the paralytic with a word.

Not understanding the Scriptures, you are all in error, lawless Hebrews: for Christ has truly come and enlightened all, and among you he has shown many signs and wonders; and vainly you deny true life.

One work I showed you and you all marvel, cried Christ to the Jews: you yourselves circumcise a man even on the Sabbath, he says: why then do you attack me for raising a paralytic with a word?

I have done many works, and for which work do you stone me? Christ cried out, as he reproached the Jews. Was it because I made a man whole with a word? Humans, do not judge by appearances.

O Christ, the offspring of the Father’s nature, working with the Spirit in the Apostles and resting in the Prophets, you have led all the nations to knowledge of you through your signs.

Glory*.*

Trinity undivided Unity, Father without beginning, Son and Holy Spirit; Trinity in Unity; God, in honour the same, coequal in majesty, life-giving, uncreated save those who hymn you, and deliver them from dangers and troubles.

Both now*.* **Theotokion.**

In your womb, Bride of God, pure Virgin-mother, you contained God, yet he was not circumscribed. Do not cease to intercede for us, that we may be delivered from troubles; for we ever flee to you for refuge.

**Ode 5. Irmos.**

O Lord, our God, give us peace. O Lord, our God, possess us. O Lord, we know no other but you, we name you by name.

**Troparia.**

By wonders you made your Apostles shine, by marvels you magnified your Disciples, glorifying them in all the world, our Saviour, and giving them your kingdom.

All the ends of the earth your Disciples enlightened with wonders and teachings, as they proclaimed in divers ways, Christ Saviour, the word of your kingdom.

We give praise to your kingdom, we offer a hymn to you who appeared on earth for our sake and enlightened the world and called back Adam.

Glory**.**

Glory to you, holy Father, God unbegotten; glory to you, Word beyond time, only-begotten; glory to you divine Spirit, co-eternal and consubstantial with the Father and the Son.

**Theotokion.**

Your womb became a holy table, having the heavenly bread, from which all who eat will not die, as he the nourisher of all has said, O Mother of God.

**Ode 6. Irmos**

Like waves of the sea, O Lover of mankind, the waves of life assail me; therefore like Jonas I cry to You, O Word: Bring my life up from corruption, compassionate Lord.

**Troparia.**

O Jesu, who control the ends of the earth, you went up and taught the crowds in the temple the word of truth at the mid-point of the feast, as John declares.

You opened your lips, Master, and proclaimed to the world the immaculate Father and the all-holy Spirit, keeping your identity of nature with them even after the incarnation.

You completed the Father’s work, you confirmed your words by works, O Saviour, performing cures and signs, making the Paralytic stand upright, cleansing lepers and raising the dead.

The Son without beginning became a beginning, taking our nature he became man; and at the middle of the feast he taught, saying: Run to the unfailing source to draw life.

Glory.

We all glorify one Godhead in Trinity, Being in three Persons, uncreated, inseparable, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, as being three yet one.

**Theotokion.**

As Virgin after childbirth we hymn you; as alone Virgin and Mother we glorify you, pure Maiden, bride of God; for from you God was truly incarnate, making us new.

**Ode 7. Irmos.**

The Chaldeans’ furnace, ablaze with flames, was bedewed with spirit by God’s authority, while the Children sang: Blessed is the God of our fathers.

**Troparia.**

The repose of all, you toiled in the flesh; the source of wonders, you thirsted willingly; you asked for water, Jesu, promising living water.

You spoke, Lord, with a woman of Samaria, reproving the folly of the lawless Hebrews; for she believed you to be Son of God, while they denied.

Saviour, the ever-living spring, you promised to give living water, welling up, water of incorruption, to those who receive in faith your Spirit, who proceeds from the Father.

You nourished thousands of the hungry with five loaves, O Saviour, and you made the remains of that fullness abound for other tens of thousands, showing your glory to your sacred Disciples.

He who eats your bread will live eternally, and he who drinks your blood, O Saviour, abides in you, and you abide in him, and you will raise him at the last instant.

You showed the marvel of your dispensation, Master, confirming the divine authority by marvels: you expelled diseases, raised the dead, gave sight to the blind as God.

You cleansed the lepers, made the lame walk, braced the paralysed, healed the woman with an issue of blood; You walked on the sea, showing your glory to your sacred Disciples.

Glory*.*

O Lord, we worship your Father without beginning, and the grace of the Spirit which, being God, you distributed to your Apostles and sent them out to preach.

**Theotokion.**

You contained in your womb the uncontainable Word, you suckled at your breasts the nourisher of the world, you carried in your embrace the maker of all, pure Mother of God.

**Ode 8. Irmos**

The one who is borne upon a throne of glory, and unceasingly glorified as God, Angels and heavens bless, praise and highly exalt to all the ages!

**Troparia.**

Come, peoples, see the one who is hymned upon a throne of glory blasphemed by lawless peoples, and seeing, hymn the Messias who was foretold by the prophets.

You are truly the Christ who is coming into the world, from whom are salvation and forgiveness of ancestral faults; you are the true life of those who believe in you.

The Wisdom of God, so it is written, came to the temple at the mid-point of the feast and taught; for he was truly the Messias, Christ, from whom is salvation.

On the Sabbath, and on all days, Christ showed the works of the signs, healing completely the sick from divers diseases; but the erring people bore grudging anger.

This man, it says, cured the Paralytic, who had been lying sick for many years, on the Sabbath, and so transgressed the Law. Thus the Jews bitterly reviled Christ.

Did not Moses, who gave you the law, not command you to be circumcised? And he circumcised a man on the Sabbath, that the law of the fathers might in no way be abolished, says Christ to the Jews.

The ever ungrateful, who of old dwelt in the desert, enviously begrudged their benefactor, blaspheming, wagging their tongues and meditating vain things

Glory*.*

The Trinity is one God; the Father does not come to sonship, nor the Son to procession, but separately and together light, I glorify God, the three, to the ages.

**Theotokion.**

Say how you gave birth to him who shone forth eternally from the Father and is hymned with the holy Spirit? As he knows, who alone was well-pleased to be born of you, O Mother of God.

**Ode 9. Irmos**

Alien to mothers is virginity, and foreign to virgins is child-bearing: in you Mother of God both are effected. Therefore all the tribes of the earth unceasingly call you blest.

**Troparia.**

At the mid-point of the feast of the Jews you came, my Saviour, to your temple, and you taught all: but the Jews marvelled, and said: Whence does this man know letters, never having learned?

Pouring out gifts of healings, my Redeemer performed signs and wonders, banishing diseases, healing the sick; but the Jews were maddened by the multitude of his wonders.

My Redeemer confounding the unbelieving Jews cried out: Do not judge by appearances; but judge just judgement: for the Law orders every man to be circumcised even on the Sabbath.

You granted your Disciples greater marvels, O Saviour, as you had promised, when you sent them to proclaim your glory to the nations: while they began to proclaim to the world your Resurrection, your grace and your incarnation.

If you circumcise a man on the Sabbath, yet the law is in no way violated; why do you upbraid me because I made a man whole with a word? You judge according to the flesh, says Christ to the Jews.

O Word, who cured the withered hand with a word, cure the long withered land of my heart, and make me fruitful, that I too, Saviour, may produce fruits by fervent repentance.

Purify my leprous heart, O Word, and give light to the eyes of my soul; stand me upright, who am lying on a bed of pain, as you raised the Paralytic as he lay on his bed.

Glory.

Alien it is to the lawless to honour the Trinity without beginning, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the uncreated omnipotence, through which the whole universe is established by the might of Its strength.

Both now*.* **Theotokion.**

You contained within your womb, Virgin Mother, one of the Trinity, Christ the Giver of life, whom all creation hymns, before whom tremble all the thrones above; beseech him, all blessed one, that our souls may be saved.
