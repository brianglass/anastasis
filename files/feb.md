THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY
=====================

****

(Having 28 days, in Leap Years 29. The day has 11 hours and the night 13)

1. Prefeast of the Meeting of our Lord Jesus Christ, and commemoration of the holy Martyr Tryphon.

He was martyred in 250, in the reign of Decius.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 4.

Your Martyr, O Lord, by his struggle obtained the crown of incorruption from You, our God; for with your might he destroyed tyrants, and shattered the feeble insolence of the demons: at his prayers, O Christ God, save our souls.

****

Another, of the Prefeast. Tone 1.

A heavenly choir from the vaults of heaven bending towards earth and seeing the First-born of all creation being carried to the temple as an infant at the breast by a Mother who has not known man, amazed with dread now sings with us a prefestal hymn.

****

Kontakion of the Martyr. Tone 8.

By the strength of the Trinity you drove polytheism from the ends of the earth, honoured Martyr, and became precious in the Lord; and having conquered tyrants through Christ the Saviour, you received the crown of your martyrdom and gifts of divine healings, as invincible.

****

2. The Meeting of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

When the forty days of the purification of the most pure Mother and ever-virgin Mary was complete, she brought her first born Son to Jerusalem on this day, which is the fortieth from his Nativity, that she might present him in the temple and fulfil the law of Moses that every first born male shall be dedicated to God, and that she might offer the sacrifice prescribed for this, a brace of pigeons or two young doves \[Lk 2.22-24; Ex 13.2; Lev 12.6-8\]. On the same day and hour the devout and just Symeon, a very old man, was present there, guided by the Holy Spirit. He had long been waiting for the salvation of God and had been informed by a divine revelation that he would not die until he had seen the Lord’s Christ. When he had seen him and taken him in his aged arms he gave glory to God and sang the third and final canticle of the New Testament, ‘Now, Master, you dismiss your servant’, and confessed that he closed his eyes in death with joy, since he had seen the light for revelation to the gentiles and the glory of Israel \[Lk 2.25-32\].

****

No work and permission for fish.

Apolytikion. Tone 1.

Hail Mother of God, Virgin full of grace! For from you the Sun of justice has dawned, Christ our God, who enlightens those in darkness. Be glad too, just Elder, for you received in your embrace the Liberator of our souls, who grants us also the Resurrection.

****

Kontakion. Tone 1.

You sanctified a virgin womb by your birth, and fittingly blessed Symeon’s hands, You have come now too and saved us, O Christ God; but give peace to your commonwealth in times of war, and strengthen our Rulers, whom You have loved, who alone love mankind.

He was from Alexandria and became a disciple of St John Chrysostom. He became a monk of the monastery at Mt Pelusium, hence he was nicknamed Pelousiotis. He became Abbot of the monks there. He wrote a great deal, particularly Letters. according to some 10,000, according to others 3,000, full of divine and human grace, and extremely useful. He died on the 5th of February 440.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 8.

In you, Father, was preserved unimpaired that which is according to the image, for you took up the cross, and you followed Christ; and by your deeds you have taught us to despise the flesh, for it passes away; but to care for the soul, which is a thing immortal; and therefore your spirit, holy Isidore, rejoices with the Angels.

****

Kontakion. Tone 4.

Finding in you, glorious Father, another Morning Star, shining with the dazzling radiance of your words, the Church cries out to you: Hail all blest Isidore, inspired by God.

5. Of the holy Martyr Agatha.

She was from Palermo in Sicily, a virgin of outstanding beauty and sobriety. After many excruciating tortures she died in prison in 251, unwilling to submit to the passion of Cydianus, the Governor of Sicily.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 4.

O Jesu, your lamb cries aloud: O my Bridegroom, I long for You; and seeking You I struggle, and I am crucified and buried with You in your baptism; and I suffer for your sake, that I may reign with You; and I die for You, that I may live in You; but as a spotless victim now accept one who with longing is slain for You. Through her prayers, as You are merciful, save our souls!

****

Kontakion. Tone 4.

Let the Church today robe itself in glorious purple, dyed from the chaste blood of the Martyr Agatha as it cries: Hail boast of Catania!

He was ordained by John the Evangelist and left as his successor Polycarp.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 4.

The truth of your actions proclaimed you to your flock as a rule of faith, an image of meekness and a teacher of self-control; and so you gained through humility the things on high, through poverty riches, O Father and high priest Voukolos; intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.

7. Of Saint Parthenios, Bishop of Lampsacus; and of the venerable Luke of Steirion in Greece.

The former flourished in the reign of Constantine the Great, about 318. Luke flourished around the middle of the tenth century, his ancestors were from Aegina. Mount Steirion is in Phocis and the nearby city is called Steiris or Stiris.

Armed with the faith and grasping the word of God as a lance with courage of soul you mortally wounded the foe, Theodore, glory of Martyrs; with them do not cease to intercede with Christ God for us all.

****

11. Of the holy Bishop and Martyr Blaise, and of the holy Augusta \[Empress\] Theodora.

He was Bishop of Sebaste \[in Armenia\]. The divine grace through which he cured the diseases of men and animals, and especially those of children, made his name well known. He suffered under Licinius in 316. The revered Empress Theodora came from Paphlagonia, daughter of a Chiliarch named Marinos. She became the wife of the iconoclast Emperor Theophilos and adorned her diadem through virtue and piety. She restored the holy Images after the death of her husband \[1st Sunday of the Fast\]. She guided the throne with great wisdom for fifteen years, while her son Michael was still a minor. In 857 she abdicated and entered a woman’s monastery called Gastria, where she lived holily for the rest of her life and fell asleep in the Lord. Her sacred relics are located today in Corfu, in the Church of the Metropolis dedicated to the Archangel Michael \[Dec.22nd\].

****

Permission for wine and oil.

Apolytikion. Tone 4.

You shared their way of life and you succeeded to the Apostles’ thrones; you found the action, O God-inspired, to climb the heights of contemplation; rightly directing the word of truth; and in faith you struggled to shedding of blood, Bishop and Martyr Blaise; intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.

****

Godly shoot, unfading flower, most fruitful branch of Christ’s vine, god-bearing Blaise, fill with joy those who honour your memory in faith as you intercede without ceasing for us all.

12. Of our Father among the Saints Meletios, archbishop of Antioch the Great.

This inspired father was from Melitine in Little Armenia, a blameless, just, god-fearing, sincere and reasonable man. He was chosen as Bishop of Sebaste in 357, but was expelled from his throne and departed to Beroea in Syria, which is now called Aleppo, according to some. He was translated to the throne of Antioch in 360, but banished shortly after by Constantius the Arian, son of Constantine the Great. After the passing of time he was recalled once more to the same throne, but was exiled a third time under Valens. He survived until the 2nd General Council of Constantinople which was summoned under Theodosios the Great in 381. He was present at it and was admired by all, and by the Emperor himself, but fell ill there and died shortly after. He was mourned by all the bishops of the Council as their own father.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 4.

The truth of your actions proclaimed you to your flock as a rule of faith, an image of meekness and a teacher of self-control; and so you gained through humility the things on high, through poverty riches, Father and high priest Meletios; intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.

****

Kontakion. Tone 6.

Fearing your spiritual boldness the apostate Macedonius flees, while we your servants fulfilling your priestly ministry have recourse to you with longing, Meletios equal of the Angels, the fiery sword of Christ our God, which slaughters all the godless, and we hymn you as the which enlightens the universe.

13. Of our venerable Father Martinianos.

He was from Caesarea in Palestine and flourished around the beginning of the 5th century. From his youth he practised the ascetic life in the deserts, but falling into temptation he moved to a certain island, but there too he suffered the same temptations, and from then on fled from place to place, saying to himself: Fly, Martinianos, and save yourself.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 8.

You quenched the flame of temptations with streams of tears, blest Father, and you bridled the waves of the sea and the assaults of wild beasts as you cried out: You have been glorified, O All-powerful, who have saved me from fire and storm.

****

Kontakion. Tone 2.

With hymns let us worthily praise the ever-honoured Martinianos as a tried practitioner of piety, by free choice an honoured athlete, a stout-hearted citizen and accomplice of the desert; for he has trampled down the serpent.

14. Of our venerable Father Auxentios.

He was from the East, under Theodosios the Less, when he was enrolled in the fourth military rank of the Scholarii, so called because they devoted themselves \[*scholazein*\] to guarding the court of the Emperor and Empress. Later he became a monk on a mountain in Bithynia and Archimandrite of the monks gathered there. He was seen to be most resolute in asceticism and most orthodox in faith. He died in the reign of Leo the Thracian, who reigned from 447 to 474.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 1.

Citizen of the desert and Angel embodied, and wonder-worker you have been declared, O God-bearing father Auxentios; by fasting and by vigil and by prayers, receiving gifts of grace from heaven, you heal the sick and the souls of those who have recourse to you in faith. Glory to Him who gave you strength; glory to Him who crowned you; glory to Him who through you works healing for all.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 4.

Your Martyrs, O Lord, by their struggles obtained crowns of incorruption from You, our God; for with your might they destroyed tyrants, and shattered the feeble insolence of the demons: at their prayers, O Christ God, save our souls.

****

Kontakion. Tone 4.

In the face of fearful tortures the Lord’s true athletes rejoiced with unflinching mind and confronted them, reckoning nothing to the flesh; therefore they have inherited everlasting glory and ever intercede for us who praise their struggles.

****

17. Of the holy Great Martyr Theodore the Recruit.

He was from Amasia in Pontus. He suffered under Maximian and Maximin in 297. He was nicknamed Tiron (from the Latin *Tiro*, which is also spelt *Tyro*), because scarcely had he been enlisted in the ranks of the Tiros, that is of the newly enlisted or first-time soldiers, he boldly declared the faith of Christ and underwent the death of martyrdom by fire.

****

Permission for wine and oil.

Apolytikion. Tone 2.

Great are the achievements of faith! In the fountain of flame, as by the water of rest, the holy Martyr Theodore rejoiced; for wholly consumed by fire he was offered to the Trinity like sweet bread. At his intercessions, Christ God, save our souls.

****

The truth of your actions proclaimed you to your flock as a rule of faith, an image of meekness and a teacher of self-control; and so you gained through humility the things on high, through poverty riches, Father and high priest Leo; intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.

****

Kontakion. Tone 3.

Seated on a priestly throne, glorious Father, you stopped the mouths of rational lions with god-inspired doctrines of the holy Trinity and shed the light of the knowledge of God on your flock; therefore you have been glorified as a godly initiate of God’s grace.

He first became bishop of Beroea (Aleppo); then in 325, after being present at the First General Council, he was translated by it to the throne of Antioch. But Constantine the Great, believing the Arians’ accusations against him, exiled him to Traianoupolis in Thrace, where he died in 337, according to some; but others extend his life to 360.

This Apostolic and Prophetic man and model of faith and truth was the disciple of John the Evangelist and successor of Voukolos (Feb.6th). He was very old, 95 years, when the fifth persecution of the Christians broke out under Marcus Aurelius who was called the Antonine philosopher. Polycarp was arrested by the proconsul of Smyrna and when urged to blaspheme Christ he said: ‘I have served Him for eighty six years and He has done me no wrong; how can I blaspheme the King who has saved me?’ But the tyrant, enraged at these words, gave orders for him to be cast into the fire. And so he perished gloriously in the year 166, having always taught, according to Eusebius, what he had learned from the Apostles, what the Church hands down, which alone is true (Eccles. Hist. IV.14 and 15).

****

Apolytikion. Tone 4.

Then in 784 he was elected Archbishop of Constantinople by the Empress Irene and her son the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus. He worked for the assembling of the 7th General Council concerning the holy images. He became the sweet fragrance of his Church and the light of the clergy under him. He died in 806.

****

27. Of our venerable Father and confessor Prokopios the Dekapolite.

He and his fellow ascetic and athlete—below on the 28th—Basil flourished around the middle of the eighth century, in the time of Leo the Isaurian, by whom they also suffered much for their reverence for the holy Icons. They ended their lives as monks.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 8.

With the streams of your tears you cultivated the barren desert, and with your deep groans your made your toils bring forth fruit a hundredfold, and you have become a beacon, shining in all the world by your wonders: Venerable Father Prokopios, intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.
