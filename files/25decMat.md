**After the 1st Reading from the Psalter, Kathisma.**

Tone 4.

Come, believers, let us see where Christ is has been born. Let us follow where the star guides with the Magi, kings of the East. Angels sing praises there without ceasing. Shepherds abiding in the fields offer a fitting hymn, saying: Glory in the highest to him who has been born today in a cave from the Virgin and Mother of God, in Bethlehem of Juda. (

**Twice**) ****

After the 2nd Reading of the Psalter, Kathisma

Same Tone.

Why, Mary, do you wonder? Why marvel at what is done in you? Because I have born in time a timeless Son, she says. But I do not understand how he was conceived. I have not known man; how then can I bear a son? Who has ever seen a birth without seed? But as it is written: where God so wills the order of nature is overcome. Christ has been born from the Virgin in Bethlehem of Judea. (

How is he contained in a womb, whom nothing can contain? How held in his Mother’s arms, he who is in the Father’s bosom? This is all as he knows, as he wished and as he was well pleased. For being without flesh, willingly he was made flesh; and He Who Is, for our sake has become what he was not; without departing from his own nature he shared in our matter; wishing to fill the world on high, Christ was born in two natures.

Verse:

The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.

The Reading is from the holy Gospel according to Matthew.

(

**1:18-25**)

Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, but before they had come together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, ‘Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.’ All this took place to fulfil what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: ‘See, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,’ which means, ‘God is with us.’ When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife, but he did not know her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus.

The Canons.

They are sung to 8 and 6 and both Irmi are sung as Katavasias. The first, by St Kosmas, has the following Acrostic:

Christ becomes mortal. God, that he was, remains.

****

Ode 1. Tone 1. The Irmos.

‘Christ is born, give glory! Christ comes from heaven, go to meet him! Christ is upon earth, be exalted! Sing to the Lord all the earth; and all you peoples raise the hymn with joy, for he has been glorified’.

Ruined through transgression, the one made in God’s image became wholly subject to corruption, fell stumbling from a better and divine life. Him the wise Creator now refashions, for he has been glorified.

The Creator, seeing humanity that he had made with his own hands perishing, bowed the heavens and came down; but he took its whole being from a divine, pure Virgin, being made truly flesh; for he has been glorified.

Wisdom, Word and Power, Son of the Father and his Radiance, Christ God, unknown to the powers beyond the world and to those on earth and having taken human nature, won us back again; for he has been glorified.

****

Another Canon, in Iambics, by Monk John, having an Acrostic in elegaic couplets:

With songs of eloquence these hymns proclaim
God’s Son for mortals’ sake on earth now born,
Abolishing the world’s grim miseries.
But, King, deliver preachers from these pains.

****

Ode 1. The same Tone. The Irmos.

‘Of old the Master who works wonders saved a people,
‘Turning the wat’ry waves of the sea into dry land;
‘And now he has been born of his own will from a Maiden,
‘Establishes a path for us to mount to heaven.
‘We glorify him, equal by essence to Father and to mortals’.

Clearly prefigured by the bush unburned
A hallowed womb has borne in it the Word,
God mingled with a mortal form, who now
Frees Eve’s unhappy womb from bitter curse
Of old. Him now we mortals glorify.

A star to Magi clearly showed the Word
Who was before the sun and yet he came
To make an end of sin, in a poor cave:
You, the compassionate, in swaddling clothes.
With joy they saw you, mortal man and Lord.

****

Ode 3. The Irmos.

‘To the Son begotten of the Father without change before the ages, and in these last times without seed made flesh from a Virgin, to Christ God let us cry aloud: You have raised up our horn. Holy are you, O Lord!’

Adam, formed of dust, who had shared in a better breath of life and slipped down to corruption through a woman’s deception, seeing Christ born from a woman cries out: For me you have become as me; glory to you, O Lord!

You have made yourself, O Christ, one in form with a moulding of vile clay, and by sharing in what is worse, our flesh, you grant a share in divine stock, becoming mortal, yet remaining God, and raising up our horn. Holy are you, O Lord!

Bethlehem be glad, palace of Juda’s Princes; for from you Christ, who shepherds Israel and is seated on the shoulders of the Cherubim, coming forth visibly and raising up our horn, reigns over all.

****

Iambic. The Irmos.

‘Accept, O Benefactor, the praises of your servants,
‘Humbling the haughty, despiteful look of the foe,
‘O blessed Lord, who see all, raise us all above sin,
‘And establish your singers, firm and unshaken,
‘Upon the foundation of the faith’.

The shepherd choir, abiding in the fields,
Counted beyond all thought worthy to see
The all-blest Offspring of an all-pure Bride,
Were stunned by the strange sight: an angel host
Praising Christ King, incarnate without seed.

He, who rules heaven’s height, in his compassion
Became as us from Maiden without bridegroom;
Word without matter once, in the last times
Made solid by the flesh, that he might draw
The fallen first created to himself.

****

The Ypakoï. Tone 8.

Heaven, calling the Magi by a star, brought the first fruits of the nations to you, an infant lying in a manger; sceptres and thrones did not astonish them, but utter poverty; for what is meaner than a cave, what humbler than swaddling clothes? In which there shone forth the wealth of your godhead. Lord, glory to you!

****

When we say an Ypakoï we do not say a Kathisma, as we have found in some Typika.

Kathisma. Tone 8.

Let heaven rejoice and let earth be glad, because the Lamb of God has been born on earth, granting redemption to the world. The Word who is in the bosom of the Father has come forth from the Virgin without seed. The Magi were amazed when they saw him in Bethlehem, born as a babe; whom all things glorify.

Glory. Both now.

**The same again.**

Ode 4. The Irmos.

‘Rod out of Jesse’s root, and flower that blossomed from his stem, O Christ, you have sprung from the Virgin, the praised from the mountain overshadowed by forest; you have come made flesh from her who knew not wedlock, yet God not formed of matter. Glory to your power, O Lord!’

O Christ, whom Jacob foretold in days of old as Expectation of the nations, you have dawned from the tribe of Juda, you have come to plunder the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria, turning error into faith beautiful to God. Glory to your power, O Lord!

O Master, by dawning as a star out of Jacob you filled with joy the watchers of the stars, wise interpreters of the words of Balaam the Seer of old, who were brought to you as first fruits of the nations; you received them openly as they offered you their acceptable gifts.

O Christ, you came down into a virgin womb like rain upon a fleece, and as drops falling on the earth. Ethiopians and Tharsians and the isles of the Arabs, rulers of Saba and Medes, of all the earth fell down before you, O Saviour. Glory to your power, O Lord!

****

Iambic. The Irmos.

‘Of old Avvakoum the Prophet was found worthy
‘Ineffably to see the figure of the birth of Christ;
‘And he foretold in song the renewal of mankind;
‘For a young Babe, even the Word, has come forth from the mountain,
‘Which is the Virgin, for the renewal of our race’.

Equal to mortals, O Most High, you came
Forth from a Virgin, having taken flesh,
To cleanse the poison of the serpent’s head,
By nature God, leading from sunless gates
All mortals to life bringing radiance.

Nations that once were in corruption sunk
And have the foe’s destruction wholly fled,
Lift up your hands, clap them in songs of praise,
Honouring Christ alone as Benefactor,
Who in compassion has now come to us.

O Virgin, who have sprung from Jesse’s root,
The bounds of mortal nature you have passed,
Bearing the Father’s pre-eternal Word,
As it was his good pleasure to pass through,
In strange self-emptying, your womb still sealed.

****

Ode 5. The Irmos.

‘As you are God of peace and Father of mercies, you have sent us your Angel of great counsel, who grants us peace; so we are guided by the knowledge of God, watching before dawn we glorify you, only lover of mankind’.

You were enrolled among Caesar’s slaves, obeying his decree, and you have freed us, your slaves, O Christ from foe and sin; Making yourself utterly poor like us, you have made our dust divine through union and participation.

Behold, the Virgin, as it was said of old, has conceived in the womb and borne God made man, and she remains Virgin; through her we sinners, reconciled to God, let us with faith sing her praise as truly Mother of God.

****

Iambic. The Irmos.

‘From the night of deeds of error, in our darkness we keep watch,
‘And sing to you, O Christ, as to our Benefactor:
‘Come to us and grant forgiveness,
‘Make the pathway easy for us,
‘Whereby we may ascend, and so attain to glory’.

The Master by his coming in the flesh
Harsh hate against him utterly cut through,
Strength of the murderer of souls destroyed,
Unites the world to immaterial beings,
Making his Father gentle to creation.

The people that in darkness dwelt before
Saw in broad day light from a beacon fire
On high. The Son to God as heritage
Brings nations; grace ineffable bestows
Where sin once flourished more abundantly.

****

Ode 6. The Irmos.

‘The monster from the deep spat Jonas from its bowels like a new born babe, just as it had received him; while the Word having dwelt in the Virgin and taken flesh, came forth, yet kept her incorrupt, for being himself not subject to decay, he preserved his mother free from harm’.

Christ our God, whom the Father begot from the womb before the morning star and who holds the reins of the immaculate Powers, is laid in a manger of dumb beasts; he is swaddled in rags, but looses the tangled cords of offences.

A young child has been born from Adam’s matter, and a Son has been given to the believers; this is the Father and Ruler of the age to come, and he is called the Angel of great counsel; this is the mighty God who holds by his authority all creation.

****

Iambic. The Irmos.

‘Enclosed in the uttermost depth of the sea,
‘Jonas entreated you to come and still the storm;
‘And I, O Christ, pricked by the dart of the tyrant,
‘Call upon you, the slayer of evil,
‘To come quickly and deliver me from my sloth’.

Who was with God in the beginning, God
The Word, seeing our nature powerless
To guard what it once was, now gives it strength,
Lowers himself, by second fellowship
Showing it once again from passions free.

From loins of Abraham for us he came,
To raise as sons those sadly fallen in
The dark of sins that bowed them low. He dwells
In light, yet in a manger now to dwell
For man’s salvation he has been well pleased.

Today the Virgin gives birth to him who is above all being,

Bethlehem has opened Eden, come, let us see;
We have found delight in secret, come let us receive
The joys of Paradise within the cave;
There the unwatered root has appeared whose blossom is forgiveness,
There has been found the undug well
From which David once wished to drink;
There a Virgin has borne a babe
And has at once quenched Adam’s and David’s thirst.
For this let us hasten to this place where there has been born
**A little Child: God before the ages.**

Synaxarion.

On the 25th day of the same month, the Nativity according to the flesh of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ.

****

Verses.

God the one born, the Mother too a Virgin:
What greater wonder had creation seen?
Mary the Virgin bore God on the twenty fifth day of December.

God, who loves mankind, seeing the human race under the tyranny of the devil, took compassion on it, and sending his Archangel Gabriel, he said to the Mother of God: ‘Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you’. And at once our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son and Word of God, was conceived in her immaculate womb. And when the nine months were completed from her conceiving, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for the whole inhabited world to be enrolled; and Kyrinios was sent to Jerusalem to make the enrolment in Bethlehem. Joseph the guardian of the Mother of God went up with her to be enrolled in Bethlehem. And when the Virgin was about to give birth, not having found lodging due to the great number of people, she entered a poor cave, and there, without corruption, she gave birth to our Lord Jesus Christ, and she wrapped him like a babe in swaddling clothes, and laid down and put in the manger of the irrational beasts the Creator of all things, as he was about to deliver us from our unreason.

On the same day, the worship by the Magi.

****

Verses.

Men from the nations worshipped you, O Word,
Showing your future honour from the Nations.

In those days there was a Seer called Balaam in the country of the Persians who prophesied many things, among which he said: ‘A star will dawn out of Jacob, and will crush the princes of Moab’. The other Seers then, holding this prophecy in succession, taught it to the kings of the Persians. And it came to these men, three in number, and they were keeping watch for when they might see such a star. But being astronomers, when they saw that Christ’s star did not follow a course like the other stars, from east to west, but from north to south, knew that it showed the birth of a great king; and having followed the star, they found Christ the Lord, and falling down they worshipped him and offered him gold, incense and myrrh. And so, on the orders of an Angel, they returned to their country.

Herod, the prince of the Jews, having learned from the Magi that a great king had been born, who was going to subdue the whole world, summoned the Magi secretly and said, ‘Go, inquire diligently about the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may go and worship him’. He said this to learn where he was and that he might send and kill him. Then, having summoned the Scribes, he asked, ‘Where does Scripture say that the Christ will be born?’ They said, ‘In Bethlehem of Judea’. Then he sent his troops to slaughter the boys in Bethlehem of two years and under. Because of this an Angel was sent from God who said to Joseph, ‘Rise, take the Child and his Mother, and flee into Egypt’. Joseph did so, and taking the Child and his Mother he went away into Egypt.

On the same day, Commemoration of the Shepherds who saw the Lord.

****

Verses.

The Shepherds, leaving their own flock behind,
To see Christ the Good Shepherd went with haste.

To him be glory to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Ode 7. The Irmos.

‘The Youths brought up together in godliness, scorning the impious decree, feared not the threat of fire, but standing in the midst of the flame they sang: God of our Fathers, blessed are you!’

Shepherds abiding in the fields had a vision of light which filled them with fear; for the glory of the Lord shone round them and an Angel crying aloud: Sing praises, for Christ is born. God of our Fathers, blessed are you!’

Suddenly, at the word of the Angel, the armies of heaven cried: Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, among men good will, Christ, has shone forth. God of our Fathers, blessed are you!’

What is this word? the Shepherds said. Let us go that we may see what has come to pass, Christ God. Having come to Bethlehem they worshipped him, with her who gave him birth, as they sang out: God of our Fathers, blessed are you!’

****

Iambic. The Irmos.

‘Caught and held fast by love for the King of all,
‘The Young Men despised the impious threats
‘Of the tyrant in his boundless fury;
‘And when the dread fire withdrew from them, they said
‘To the Master: Unto all ages, blessed are you!’

Seething and roaring in its wrath the flame
Burnt up when heated sevenfold the servants,
But the Young Men it saves, as victors crowns.
On whom the Lord, rewarding piety,
Bestows abundantly his cooling dew.

Christ our Defender, you shamed mortals’ foe,
Having your incarnation beyond speech
As shield, in human form bringing the joy
Of being like God; in hope of which we once
Fell from on high into the murky depths.

You have cast down by your almighty power
Fierce sin that raised its head in wanton pride,
And raged blaspheming through a world gone mad.
Those once dragged down today you save from snares,
O Benefactor, by your will made flesh.

****

Ode 8. The Irmos.

‘The furnace moist with dew was the image and the figure of a wonder past nature; for it did not burn those it had received; even as the fire of the godhead did not consume the Virgin’s womb into which it has descended. Therefore in praise let us sing: Let all creation bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages’.

The daughter of Babylon once dragged to herself from Sion David’s children, taken by the spear; now she sends her children, Magi taking gifts, to entreat David’s daughter, who received God. Therefore in praise let us sing: Let all creation bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.

Sorrow silenced the instruments of song, for Sion’s children did not sing among strangers; but Christ, shining forth from Bethlehem, abolishes all the error of Babylon and the harmony of her musicians. Therefore in praise let us sing: Let all creation bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.

Babylon received the spoils of Sion the Queen and her wealth taken by the spear; Christ in Sion draws with a guiding star her treasures, Magi who scanned the stars. Therefore in praise let us sing: Let all creation bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.

****

Iambic. The Irmos.

‘The young men of the old covenant, walking in the fire
‘Unburned are figures of the sealed womb of the Maiden,
‘When she gave birth in fashion past nature;
‘The same grace it was worked both by one wondrous power,
‘And raises the people to sing in praise’.

Fleeing the outrage of becoming God
By error, all creation like the youths
With trembling hymns the everlasting Word
Self emptied; fears to bring a prayer despised;
Subject to change, by wisdom though endures.

The nations Rising, you have come to turn
Back human nature from the desert hills
To pasture rich in flowers. Now destroy
The violent force of mortals’ murderer,
By providence now seen as God and man.

Be glad, you just, heavens rejoice, mountains leap for joy; Christ is born and the Virgin sits like the Cherubim throne carrying in her bosom God the Word made flesh. Shepherds glorify the one that is born; Magi offer gifts to the Master; Angels sing praises, saying: Lord beyond understanding, glory to you!

Glory.

**Tone. 6 By Germanos.**

When the moment came for your coming upon earth a first enrolment of the world took place; then you were about to enrol the names of all who believed in your birth; because of this such a decree was published by Caesar, for the timelessness of your eternal kingdom was newly revealed. And so we too offer beyond tribute in money the wealth of our orthodox faith to you, the God and Saviour of our souls.

Both now.

**2nd Tone. By Monk John.**

Today Christ is born of the Virgin in Bethlehem. Today he who is without beginning begins to be, and the Word is made flesh. The Powers of heaven rejoice, and earth with mankind is glad. The Magi offer gifts; the Shepherds proclaim the marvel, while we cry aloud without ceasing: Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth; good will among men.
