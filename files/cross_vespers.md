THE THIRD SUNDAY IN LENT

****

THE ADORATION OF THE PRECIOUS
AND LIFE-GIVING CROSS

ON SATURDAY EVENING at GREAT VESPERS

****

After the Dismissal of Small Vespers, the Precious Cross is brought from the sacristy and placed with its case on the Holy Table. A candle is lit and left burning in front of it all night.

After the Opening Psalm, we read

Blessed is the man*,* ***t*he first Kathisma.**

At

Lord, I have cried*,* **we insert ten Stichera: six of the Resurrection in the Tone of the week from the Oktoichos, and the following four Prosomia from the Triodion:**

Tone 5. Hail of ascetics

Shine, Cross of the Lord, with the bright darting rays of your grace on the hearts of those who honour you, and with love inspired by God, embrace you, O desire of all the world. Through you our tears of sorrow have been wiped away; we have been delivered from the snares of death and have passed over to unending joy. Show us the splendour of your beauty, granting to us your servants the reward of our abstinence, for we entreat with faith your rich protection and great mercy.

Hail, life-giving Cross! the fair Paradise of the Church, Tree of incorruption that blossoms for us with the enjoyment of eternal glory. Through you the hosts of demons are driven back, the companies of the Angels rejoice with one accord and the congregations of the faithful keep the feast. You are an invincible weapon, an unbroken stronghold; you are the victory of kings and the glory of priests. Grant us also now to draw near to the Passion of Christ and to His Resurrection.

Hail, life-giving Cross! unconquerable trophy of the true faith, door to Paradise, succour of the faithful, rampart set about the Church. Through you the curse has utterly destroyed, the power of death swallowed up, and we are raised from earth to heaven: invincible weapon, adversary of demons, glory of martyrs, true ornament of holy monks, haven of salvation bestowing on the world great mercy.

Come, first-fashioned pair, who fell from the choir on high through the envy of the murderer of humankind, through the bitter pleasure of tasting from the tree. See, the Tree, revered by all, draws near! Run with haste and embrace it joyfully, and cry to it with faith: O all-honoured Cross, you are our succour; partaking of your fruits we have gained incorruption; we are restored once more to Eden, and we have received great mercy.

Glory.

**Tone 3.**

O Christ our God, of your own will you accepted Crucifixion, for the common restoration of humankind. Taking the reed pen of the Cross, out of love for humankind, in the red ink of royalty with bloody fingers you signed our absolution. Do not forsake us, who are in danger once again of being parted from you. Take pity on your people in distress, for you alone are longsuffering. Rise up and fight against our enemies, as you are all- powerful.

Both now.

**Theotokion in the Tone of the week from the Oktoichos.**

Entrance,

O Joyful Light***,* and the Prokeimenon of the day,** The Lord is King. ****

Alphabetical Aposticha in the Tone of the week from the Oktoichos, and then:

Glory. Both now.

**Tone 4.**

Lord, who helped gentle David in the combat and enabled him to overcome the foreigner, come to the aid of our faithful Sovereign and by the weapon of the Cross cast down our enemies. In your compassion show us your mercy as of old, and make them know in truth that you are God, and putting our trust in you may we conquer. At the constant intercessions of your most pure Mother, grant us your great mercy.

****

If there is a Vigil, Apolytikion

Virgin Mother of God **twice,
and that of the Cross once.**

Of the Cross. Tone 1.

Lord, save your people**,** and bless your inheritance, granting to faithful Christians victories over their enemies, and protecting your commonwealth by your Cross.

****

If there is no Vigil, those of the Resurrection, the Cross
and the Theotokion.

When Gabriel addressed you, O Virgin, with his ‘Hail’, as he spoke the Master of all things became incarnate in you the holy Ark, as righteous David sang. You were proclaimed wider than the heavens, for you carried your Creator. Glory to him who dwelt in you, glory to him who came forth from you, glory to him who has set us free through your bearing child.
