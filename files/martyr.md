AT VESPERS
==========

**At** Lord, I have cried**, we sing Prosomia.**

Tone 4. As noble among Martyrs.

You put on the purple garment of your flesh, made scarlet with blood by divine grace, glorious, all wise Martyr, and, having bound your head with a diadem of incorruption and life, holding in your right hand the trophy of the Cross like a sceptre, you reign with Christ rejoicing for ever.

You have become known, revered Martyr, as an invincible warrior, for having armoured yourself with the weapon of the Cross you went out to single combat with the hostile champion and utterly defeated him, triumphing brilliantly and receiving the crown of victory from the only judge and Master of the contest, who reigns as king for ever.

By your honoured sufferings, glorious, invincible Athlete, you were an image of the honoured suffering of Christ, and becoming a victor you dwell with all the saints in the city on high, glad champion, and by participation in God are made divine; and so we celebrate your honoured and holy festival.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

As I sail by sea, travel by road, sleep by night, watch over me; give me the grace of a watchful mind, All-blameless, and grant that I may do the Lord’s will; that on the day of sentence I may find release from all that I have done in life, I who flee to your protection.

****

Or Cross-Theotokion.

When the Ewe-lamb, your Mother, saw you nailed to the Cross, Lord, she was struck with amazement, and cried out: What is this sight, my Son so greatly loved? Is this how the disobedient, lawless people repays your many wonders? But glory, Master, to your ineffable condescension!

AT MATINS

**Accept my eighth ode, O All-blessed. Joseph.
**By Joseph.**

Ode 1. Tone 8. Irmos. Crossing the sea.

\[Crossing the water as on dry land and fleeing the harsh misery of Egypt, the Israelite cried aloud, To our Redeemer and our God now let us sing!\]

****

Troparia.

Revered Martyr of Christ, having accomplished the godly contest, you have been found worthy of the heavenly kingdom, as you intercede on behalf of the world.

By godly struggles you changed the tyrant’s decree; but, brave athlete, I beg you by your mediations take pity on me, who am always being changed for the worse.

You were declared to be a temple of the all-powerful, O Martyr of Christ; by your prayers show those who sing your praises in your honoured shrine to be the dwellings of the Spirit.

****

Theotokion.

He who is full empties himself, O Pure one, in your womb, yet does not empty his Father’s bosom; implore him therefore to grant salvation to those who honour you with faith.

****

Ode 3. Irmos. You are the foundation.

\[You are the foundation, Lord, of those who have recourse to you; you are the light of those in darkness; and my spirit sings your praise.\]

****

Troparia.

Abandoning race and fame, Martyr of Christ, you were eager to die; and so you enjoy eternal life.

Give help, O Martyr, to us who are always endangered by the insults of the world and by fearful troubles.

You have found bliss and are full of every illumination; intercede then, O Champion, that all may be enriched with righteousness.

Theotokion.

You carried the ear of corn that had not been husbanded, O Immaculate, which nourishes the hearts of all of us who faithfully sing your praise.

****

Kathisma. Tone 5. Let us believers praise.

Radiant with the forms of virtues, made beautiful by the light of martyrdom, you shine more brightly than the sun, wise Martyr, strong as steel, and you truly illumine those who faithfully celebrate your light-bearing memorial, all-glorious Champion, and who venerate your relics.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Hail gate of the Lord, through which none may pass; hail wall and protection of those who flee to you; hail haven without storms and who did not know wedlock; who bore in the flesh your Maker and God, do not cease to intercede for those who hymn and worship your offspring.

****

Or Cross-Theotokion. Same melody.

By the Cross of your Son, O full of God’s grace, all the error of idols has been destroyed and the strength of the demons trampled down; and so we faithful, as is fitting, ever hymn and bless you, and confessing you to be Mother of God, magnify you.

****

\[Lord, I have heard the mystery of your dispensation; I have considered your works and glorified your Godhead.\]

****

Troparia.

I have disregarded God’s laws, I have lived in every lawlessness; hasten, holy Martyr, help me, who am under condemnation, I implore you.

Bound for the Lord’s sake, you undid all the wickedness of the foe; from which save, O Martyr, all those who faithfully make their prayer to you.

On the day of judgement, when we stand before the Lord to be judged, become a helper for us who are under condemnation, glorious Martyr.

In accordance with laws you competed; empower us then to keep the laws of the Almighty, glorious Martyr.

****

Theotokion.

Virgin Mother of God, implore your Son to give us pardon of faults and his mercy.

****

\[Be merciful to me, Saviour, for my iniquities are many; and lead me up, I beg, from a deep of evils, for I have cried to you; and hearken to me, God of my salvation.\]

****

Troparia.

Wise Martyr, a light which never sets has dawned for you who struggled, and holy tents of joy received you. As you dwell in them remember those who sing your praise on earth.

Revered Martyr, you accomplished great struggles on earth; by your sacred prayers rescue us from great evils, dangers and tribulations, that we may glorify you with love.

Do not declare me, Jesu, to be one condemned when I stand before your dread throne, O Word; but take pity, save me at the godly mediations of your Saint, O you of many mercies.

Theotokion.

Hallow my mind and guide my soul to light, All-holy Maiden, Mother of God and ever-Virgin who ineffably bore God who rests among the saints.

Troparia.

Joy of Martyrs, save me from the world’s stumbling blocks, the dishonour of passions and every tribulation, and grant that I may sing each day: God of our fathers, blessed are you!

My good protector, do not utterly despise me who am storm-tossed by the troubles of life, but take pity on me by your prayers, and save me who sing: God of our fathers, blessed are you!

Save me, all-blessed one, by your fervent help from foul sloth, dread sin and blackness, for I have recourse to you in faith, that I may faithfully honour you to all the ages.

****

Having squandered the years of my life in great indifference, O Virgin, I fall down before you and cry out: Rouse me, save me, as I cry to your Son: God of our fathers, blessed are you!

Victors over tyrant and flame and by your grace, the Youths who held fast to your commandments cried aloud: All you works of the Lord, bless the Lord!

****

Troparia.

You were tried, O invincible, like gold in a fire of torments, and were revealed as an imprint of the sufferings of Christ as you cried out: All you works of the Lord, bless the Lord!

By your prayers, holy Martyr, save me who am storm-tossed and trapped by the dread deceptions of the Stranger, as I cry out: All you works of the Lord, bless the Lord!

You abolished all the power of the boaster, deliver me, glorious Martyr, from his wickedness as I cry aloud: All you works of the Lord, bless the Lord!

****

Troparia.

That with godly voices we may call you blessed, revered Martyr, who nobly struggled and smashed the goads of the deceiver, save us, who have gained you as our noble protector, from dangers, afflictions and troubles of many kinds.

Like the dawn, like the morning star you have dawned, revered Martyr, and enlightened by your teachings all the ends of the earth, and banished the dread darkness of the demons; and so enlighten me, darkened in soul by sloth.

Establish all those who faithfully ever take refuge under your protection, revered Martyr, lest we be overwhelmed by life’s troubles and the wiles of the evil one, who year by year magnify and glorify you.

Take care, my soul, the great day of judgement has drawn near, when what is made is brought to judgement. And what will you do, as you persist in evil works? Make and cry out: At the prayers of your Saint save me, O Lord!

****

Theotokion.

Wretch that I am, I tremble at your impartial tribunal, O only King; keep me then uncondemned in your compassion, the all-pure Lady, who ineffably gave you a body, implore s you insistently, O Christ of many mercies.

****

Irmos.

Every ear trembled at the ineffable condescension of God: how the Most High willingly came down even to a body, and became man from a virgin womb; and so we faithful magnify the Mother of God.
