SUNDAY OF ALL SAINTS
====================

****

ON SATURDAY EVENING

AT GREAT VESPERS

****

After the Opening Psalm and the 1st Kathisma of the Psalter, at

Lord, I have cried **we insert 10 Stichera and sing 6 of the Resurrection and 4 of the Saints.**

Resurrection Stichera. Tone 8.

We offer you, O Christ, an evening hymn and spiritual worship; because you were well-pleased to have mercy on us through the Resurrection.

Lord, Lord, do not cast us away from your presence; but be well-pleased to have mercy on us through the Resurrection.

Hail holy Sion, Mother of the Churches, dwelling-place of God; for it was you who first received forgiveness of sins through the Resurrection.

****

Other Stichera, by Anatolios

The Word begotten of God the Father before the ages, but in the last times incarnate of her who knew not wedlock, willingly endured the crucifixion of death, and mankind, slain of old, He saved through his own Resurrection.

We glorify your Resurrection from the dead, O Christ, through which you freed Adam’s race from the tyranny of Hell, and as God granted the world eternal life and your great mercy.

Glory to you, Christ Saviour, only-begotten Son of God, nailed to the cross and risen from the tomb on the third day.

****

Others, of All Saints. Tone 6.

The Spirit-inspired preachers, the Disciples of the Saviour, having become by faith instruments of the Spirit, distributed the holy proclamation, sowing it with right belief, to the ends of the earth, from which, by God’s husbandry and grace, have sprung up the armies of Martyrs, who form an image of the holy Passion through many kinds of tortures, scourgings and fire; and with boldness they intercede on behalf of our souls.

Burning with the fire of the love of the Lord, they despised fire, and as lighted godlike coals the holy Martyrs by Christ burned up the brushwood insolence of error; while they stopped the mouths of wild beasts by wise entreaties, and when their heads were cut off they cut down all the regiments of the foe; and valiantly pouring out the streams of their blood they watered the Church, which then blossomed with faith.

The valiant Martyrs wrestled with wild beasts, were struck with swords, raked with claws, their hands were cut off and they were racked; without yielding they were burned with material fire, they were pierced and their joints were severed. They bore all most valiantly, as they looked forward to their coming rest, the pure crowns and the glory of Christ; to whom with boldness they intercede on behalf of our souls.

Let us, as is fitting, praise with sacred songs those who have competed by faith in all the ends of the earth, Apostles, Martyrs, godly-minded Priests, holy Women, a sacred gathering; for earthly beings were united with the heavenly and by suffering received through Christ’s grace dispassion; and now like fixed stars their shed their light on us, as with boldness they intercede on behalf of our souls.

Glory.

**Tone 6.**

Godly choir of Martyrs, foundation of the Church, perfection of the Gospel, you have by deeds fulfilled the Saviour’s words; for in you the gates of Hell, opened against the Church, have been shut; the flow of your blood has dried up the libations poured out to idols; your slaughter has given birth the plenitude of the faithful; you have amazed the bodiless powers; bearing crowns you stand before God, whom you ceaselessly implore on behalf of our souls.

Both now.

**Tone 8.**

The King of heaven through love for mankind appeared on earth and lived among men; for taking flesh from a pure Virgin and coming forth from her with the addition, He is one Son, double in nature, but not in person; therefore proclaiming Him as truly perfect God and perfect man, we confess Christ our God; implore Him, Mother without bridegroom, to have mercy on our souls.

****

Entrance,

O Joyful Light. **After the Prokeimenon of the day, the Readings.**

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Isaias. \[

**43:9-14<sup>a</sup>**\]

Thus says the Lord: All the nations have been assembled and rulers from them shall be assembled; who will declare these things among them? or who will make heard to you the things from the beginning? Let them bring their witnesses and let them be justified, and them hear and let them speak what is true. Be my witnesses, and I too am a witness, says the Lord God, and my servant whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe me, and understand that I AM; before me there was no other God, and after me there will not be. I am God, and apart from me there is none who saves. I have declared and I have saved; I reproved, and there was no strange god among you. You are my witnesses and I am a witness, says the Lord God. Again from the beginning I AM, and there is none who can deliver from my hands; I will make, and who will turn it back? Thus says the Lord God who redeems us, the holy one of Israel.

The Reading is from the Wisdom of Solomon. \[

**3:1-9**\]

The souls of the just are in the hand of God, and no torment will touch them. In the eyes of fools they seemed to die and their departure was reckoned a disaster and their going from us their destruction; but they are at peace. For though in the sight of men they were punished, their hope is full of immortality. Having been disciplined a little, they will receive great good, because God tested them and found them worthy of himself. Like gold in the furnace he tried them and like a whole burnt offering he accepted them. And in the time of their visitation they will shine forth, and will run like sparks through stubble. They will judge nations and rule over peoples, and the Lord will reign over them forever. Those who trust in him will understand truth, and the faithful will abide with him in love, because grace and mercy are upon his holy ones and visitation on his elect.

The Reading is from the Wisdom of Solomon. \[

**5:16-6:3<sup>b</sup>**\]

The just live for ever, and their reward is with the Lord; the Most High takes care of them. Therefore they will receive a glorious crown and a beautiful diadem from the hand of the Lord, because with his right hand he will cover them, and with his arm he will shield them. He will take his zeal as his whole armour, and will arm all creation to repel his enemies; he will put on righteousness as a breastplate, and will wear impartial justice as a helmet; he will take holiness as an invincible shield, and sharpen stern wrath for a sword, and creation will join with him to fight against his frenzied foes. Shafts of lightning will fly with true aim, and will leap from the clouds to the target, as from a well-drawn bow, and hailstones full of wrath will be hurled as from a catapult; the water of the sea will rage against them, and rivers will relentlessly overwhelm them; a mighty wind will rise against them, and like a tempest it will winnow them away. Lawlessness will lay waste the whole earth, and evil-doing will overturn the thrones of rulers. Listen, therefore, O kings, and understand; learn, O judges of the ends of the earth. Give ear, you that rule over multitudes, and boast of many nations. For your dominion was given you from the Lord, and your sovereignty from the Most High.

****

At the Liti we sing the Sticheron of the Saint of the Monastery; then the following Idiomels of All Saints.

Tone 1

In a harmony of faith let us all spiritually celebrate the festival of the whole world of those who from all time have been well-pleasing to God, the honour of the Patriarchs, the assembly of the Prophets, the adornment of Apostles, the company of Martyrs, the boast of Ascetics, the memory of all the Saints; for they intercede without ceasing that peace may be given to the world and to our souls God’s great mercy.

Come, all you faithful, let us praise in psalms and hymn and spiritual songs the all-glorious memory of all the Saints: the Baptist of the Saviour, Apostles, Prophets and Martyrs, Hierarchs, Teachers, Holy Ones, Ascetics and Righteous, and the God-loving company of holy Women, as with reverence we call them blessed in harmony let us cry out: Christ our God, supremely good, at their prayers grant peace to your Churches, victories over enemies to our Christ-loving Sovereign, and to our souls your great mercy.

Come, let us rejoice in spirit at the memorial of the Saints; for see, it has come bringing us gifts of grace in rich abundance; and so with a voice of gladness and a pure conscience let us cry out and say: Hail, company of Prophets, who proclaimed the coming of Christ to the world and foresaw near at hand things far off. Hail, choir of Apostles, who caught the nations in a net, and who are the fishers of mankind. Hail, race of Martyrs, who were gathered from the ends of the into one faith, endured for it fierce torments and finally received the crown of your contest. Hail, swarm of Fathers, who trampled down your own bodies by ascetic struggle, and when you had slain the passions of the flesh you gave wings to your mind with divine love and took flight to heaven, and as you rejoice with the Angels, you enjoy eternal blessings. But, O Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs with Ascetics, insistently implore the one who crowned you that those who celebrate with faith and love your ever-revered memorial may be rescued from enemies visible and invisible.

Glory.

**Tone 5**

Let us the faithful hasten together to the present festival; for a spiritual table and a mystical wine-bowl are set before us, filled with sweet foods of joy: the virtues of the Martyrs; for these brave-hearted ones from the ends of the earth offered to God as a rational sacrifice the many tortures of their bodily extremities and the prime of their years; some had their heads cut off, others were dismembered of hands and of every joint together; all the Saints became partakers of Christ’s sufferings. But Lord, who gave them crowns as rewards of their torments, count us worthy to live according to their example, as you love mankind.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

At the Aposticha Resurrection Stichera. Tone 8.

O Jesu, who came down from heaven, you ascended the Cross; you came, the immortal Life, to death; the true Light, to those in darkness; the Resurrection of all, to those who had fallen. Our illumination and our Saviour, glory to you.

****

Alphabetical.

Let us glorify Christ who rose from the dead: for having taken a body and a soul, he parted them from one another by the passion; for his soul descended into Hell, whom he despoiled, while the holy body of the Redeemer of our souls did not know corruption in the tomb.

We glorify your Resurrection from the dead, O Christ, in psalms and hymns. Through it you have freed us from the tyranny of Hell, and as God granted us eternal life and your great mercy.

You, Master of all things, incomprehensible Maker of heaven and earth, by suffering the Cross became for me the source of dispassion. Accepting burial and rising in glory, you raised Adam with you by your all-powerful hand. Glory to your Rising on the third day, through which you have granted us eternal life and forgiveness of sins, as you alone are compassionate.

Glory.

Come you faithful, let us today strike up a dance and devoutly keep festival and gloriously honour the glorious and revered memory of all the Saints, as we say: Hail, glorious Apostles, Prophets and Martyrs and Hierarchs. Hail, company of Ascetics and of the just. Hail, choir of honoured Women; and intercede with Christ for the world, to grant victories to our sovereign and to our souls his great mercy.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

All-pure Lady, Christ the Lord, my Maker and Redeemer, by coming from your womb and clothing himself in me, freed Adam from the former curse. And so, all-pure, as to her who is truly the Mother of God and Virgin, we cry to you unceasingly the Angel’s ‘Hail’: Hail, Lady, defence, protection and salvation of our souls.

****

Resurrection Apolytikion. Tone 8

You the Compassionate came down from above, you accepted burial for three days, that you might free us from the passions. Our Life and Resurrection, Lord, glory to you!

Glory.

**Of the Saints. Tone 4.**

Clothed as in purple and fine linen with the blood of your Martyrs throughout the world, your Church cries out to you through them, Christ God: Send down your pity on your people; give peace to your commonwealth, and to our souls your great mercy.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

The mystery hidden from all eternity and unknown to Angels has been revealed to those on earth through you, O Mother of God: God being made flesh in a union without confusion, and willingly accepting the Cross for us, through which he raised the first-formed man, and saved our souls from death.

The Blessing of Loaves and the Reading.

AT MATINS

****

After the 1st Reading from the Psalter Kathismata of the Resurrection from the Oktoichos.

Tone 8.

You rose from the dead, the Life of all, and an Angel of light cried to the women: Cease your tears, give the good tidings to the Apostles; cry aloud in hymns that Christ the Lord has risen, who as God was well-pleased to save the human race.

****

Verse:

Arise, O Lord my God, lift up your hand; forget not your poor for ever.

Humans sealed your grave, O Saviour, an Angel rolled the stone from the door. Women saw you risen from the dead, and it was they who gave the good tidings to your Disciples in Sion: The life of all has risen and the bonds of death are loosed. Lord, glory to you.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

You were born of a Virgin for us, and endured crucifixion, O Good One; by your death you despoiled Death, and as God you gave us Resurrection: do not despise those whom you fashioned with your own hand; show us your compassion, O merciful; accept the Mother of God who bore you as she intercedes for us, and save, our Saviour, a people in despair.

****

After the 2nd Reading, Kathismata. Same Tone.

Radiant in snowy white Gabriel stood at the tomb of Christ as in the form of lightning, and rolled away the stone from the grave; and great fear seized your guards, and suddenly all stayed as if dead: the guards from the tomb and the seal from the stone. Be ashamed transgressors; know that Christ has risen.

****

Verse:

I will confess you, Lord, with my whole heart; I will tell of all your marvellous works.

Truly risen from the tomb you ordered the holy women to proclaim the Resurrection to the Apostles, as it is written; and Peter running stood by the grave and seeing the light in the tomb he was struck with amazement: so he both saw the grave clothes in it lying alone, without the divine body, and he believed and cried out: Glory to you Christ our God, for you save us all, our Saviour, for you are the brightness of the Father.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Because of you, O Full of grace, all creation rejoices, the ranks of Angels and the race of men; hallowed Temple and spiritual Paradise, pride of Virgins; from you God was incarnate and He who is our God before the ages became a little child. For he made your womb a throne and caused it to become wider than the heavens. Because of you, O Full of grace, all creation rejoices; glory to you.

****

After Psalm 118, the Evlogitaria and the Ypakoï. Tone 8.

The myrrh-bearing women standing at the grave of the Giver of life were seeking the immortal Master among the dead; and when they received the good tidings of joy from the Angel they revealed to the Apostles that Christ had risen, granting the world his great mercy.

****

The Anavathmi. 1st Antiphon.

From my youth the enemy tempts me, burns me with pleasures; but I, trusting in you, Lord, put him to flight.

Those who hate Sion, let them become like grass before it is dug up; for Christ will cut their necks with a sharp blade of torments.

Glory. Both now.

By the Holy Spirit all things live; Light of Light, mighty God: we hymn Him with the Father and the Word.

****

2nd Antiphon.

Let my humble heart be sheltered by fear of you; lest it fall away from you by being exalted, O all-merciful.

He who has his hope in the Lord will not be afraid when he judges all things by fire and punishment.

Glory. Both now.

By the Holy Spirit every godly man sees and foretells and works the greatest wonders, as he sings one God in three Persons; for though it shines with a triple light, the Divine rules as one.

****

3rd Antiphon.

I have cried to you, Lord, give heed, bend your ear to me as I call and cleanse me before you take me from what is here.

Each one who sinks back upon his mother earth will depart to receive torments or rewards for his life’s actions.

Glory. Both now.

By the Holy Spirit contemplation of God is of a thrice-holy unity; for the Father is without beginning, from whom was the Son beyond time, and the Spirit equal in form and throne, equal in radiance.

****

4th Antiphon.

Behold, what so good, what so pleasant as brothers dwelling together? For in this the Lord promised eternal life.

He who adorns the lilies of the field commands us not to be concerned over our raiment.

Glory. Both now.

By the Holy Spirit, by one single cause all things gain the reward of peace; for He is God exactly consubstantial with both the Father and the Son.

The Canons: of the Resurrection to 4, of the Cross and Resurrection to 2, of the Mother of God to 2 and of the Saints to 6.

Canon of All Saints. The same Tone. Its Acrostic is:

Many the names of the ranks of All Saints in whose honour I sing this. ****

Ode 1.

As I sing the praise of the ranks of your Saints, I beg you by your light to shed your rays on my soul at their prayers. For you are the unapproachable light, dispelling the gloom of ignorance by your torches, O Word of God, Christ giver of light.

As you were lifted up on the Tree, Master, you drew to knowledge of you the whole inheritance of the nations, and made it radiant with the light of the holy Trinity through your holy Apostles, through whom you drove out deception.

Obedient to your commandment, O Christ, your glorious Apostles devoutly renounced everything on earth; and by the light of grace they made bright the whole inhabited world as they preached you through the Gospel.

Rejoicing, the noble Martyrs took up the Cross and unflinchingly imitating your sacred passion, they did not tremble at the threats of tyrants, at fire, sword, scourges, not even starvation or death.

****

Theotokion.

The virgins, having taken up a manly intent, unflinchingly endured the contests of martyrdom, and as in the Psalms, all-pure Virgin, following after you rejoicing together, inspired by God, they were offered to your Son, the king of all.

****

Ode 3.

The Priests and Shepherds, clothed with sacred priesthood, wisely guided it, O Christ, and worthily adorned it, truly enriched with the word of teaching from on high.

Made fair by the beauties of that first created beauty, and revealed as unerring beacons, you made Christ’s Church a heaven, O Saints, each in his place adorning it in varied ways.

Obedient to your law, the companies of the blessed, radiant with virtues of many kinds, have inherited with joy the heavenly mansions; for they all filled them worthily, each one their own.

****

Theotokion.

Mother of God, from a virgin womb for us you gave birth to God the Word from God; whom pure maidens desired in a godlike manner, and in your train they all followed him.

****

Kontakion and Ikos from the Oktoichos.

Kathisma. Tone 8.

As we celebrate the holy memory, Christ God, Forebears, Parents, Patriarchs, Apostles, Martyrs, Hierarchs, Prophets and your Holy Ones, Ascetics and Just, and each one whose name is inscribed in the book of life, we urge them all to intercession, as we beg: Give peace to your world through them, as you love mankind, that we may all cry out to you: O God, glorified in the Council of your Saints, you are truly the one who fittingly glorifies their memory.

****

Glory. Both now. Theotokion.

Let us praise the heavenly gate and ark, the all-holy mountain, the radiant cloud, the heavenly ladder, the spiritual Paradise, the ransom of Eve, the great treasure of the whole inhabited world; because salvation was accomplished in her for the world and forgiveness of ancient offences. Therefore we cry to her: Intercede with your Son and God, to grant forgiveness of faults to those who devoutly worship your all-holy Offspring.

****

Ode 4.

The company of your Saints, joined together through love and sincerely and purely delighting in you, dances in joy with the perpetual dance of the Angels around you, who see all, the God and Lord of all.

Glorious and all-blessed Martyr Priests, once gleaming with the divine anointing of the priesthood, you bound on like youths the Martyrs’ wreath of victory; and so fittingly receiving double crowns, you rejoice with Christ eternally.

Godbearing Fathers, you subjected every fleshly thought to the spirit, withering their unruly assaults by fasting and ascetic discipline; and now aflame with the light of dispassion, you have received the rewards of your labours.

As Martyrs of Christ, the Protomartyr, you endured great torments, bravely and outstandingly, struggling, glorious Saints, as in bodies not your own; and now, revealed as heirs of the kingdom, you are source of healings for the faithful.

****

Theotokion.

Bride of God, you became Mother of God; for you gave birth for us in bodily form to the Word before time, by whom women also have led holy lives and adorned through you by contests of many kinds, they have restored the fall of our Foremother.

****

Ode 5.

As godly Prophets you were found worthy to foresee the things to come, longing for which with nobility of soul you purified your selves by holy living, O Godbearers, enlightened by the strength of the Spirit.

The choir of the Saints is now made bright by divine gifts of grace, all those before the law, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, companies of Martyrs, Ascetics, Teachers and Righteous with Priest Martyrs.

As we see the throng of your Saints shining today, O Saviour, with your brightness, and with unquenchable lamps of grace, we unceasingly sing the praise of your divine riches and unstinted blessings.

****

Theotokion.

All-holy women, filled with love of most wondrous Offspring, reckoned the delights of life as nothing, O all-pure, and desiring passionately his brightness alone and his divine radiance.

****

Ode 6.

The Saints, having found you, Master, in Sion placed as a precious, chosen cornerstone, an unshakeable foundation, built themselves on you as chosen stones.

When your side was pierced streams of blood dropped from it along with deifying water and refashioned the world and summoned a godly throng of all the Saints, O Benefactor.

With hymn most devoutly the inspired cloud of Martyrs, made radiant by grace and shining brilliantly with the purple of their blood and with the crimson of their valiant contest.

****

Theotokion.

We all know you as most truly Mother of God, through whom women’s nature was given strength, O all-blameless, and so competed on behalf of Christ and became filled devoutly with every virtue.

****

Kontakion. Tone 8.

As first fruits of nature, Lord, creation’s Planter, the world offers you, the god-bearing Martyrs; at their intercessions preserve your Church in profound peace, through the Mother of God, O most merciful.

****

The Ikos

Those who bore witness in all the earth and made their home in heaven, those who imitated the sufferings of Christ and who take away our passions, are gathered here today, revealing the Church of the firstborn, who bears the type of the one above, and which cries out to Christ: You are my God; keep me through the Mother of God, O most merciful.

****

The Synaxarion from the Menaion, then the following.

On this day, the Sunday after Pentecost, we celebrate the feast of all the Saints from throughout the inhabited world, in Asia, Libya and Europe, in North and South.

****

Verses

I sing the praise of each friend of my Lord,

If any would, let them now list them all.

Our most godlike Fathers decreed that we should celebrate the present feast after the descent of the All-holy Spirit, as showing in a certain way that the coming of the All-holy Spirit acted through the Apostles like this: sanctifying and making wise human beings taken from our mortal clay and, for the completion of that fallen angelic order, restoring them and through Christ sending them to God, some by the witness of martyrdom and blood, others by their virtuous conduct and way of life; and things beyond nature are achieved. For the Spirit descends in the form of fire, whose natural momentum is upwards; while dust, whose natural momentum is downwards, ascends on high, that dust which forms our mortal clay, the flesh added to and made divine by God the Word, which a short time before, had been exalted and taken its seat at the right hand of the Father’s glory. But he now also draws all those who wish, according to the promise, just as God the Word had manifested the works of reconciliation and what was the end, most suitable to its purpose, of his coming to us through flesh and of his dispensation, namely that he brings those who were rejected before to union and friendship with God — human nature offering to God the ungrateful people from the nations like first fruits —those who were outstandingly well-pleasing to him. This is one reason that we celebrate the feast of All Saints.

A second reason is because, though many people have been well-pleasing to God, they were through outstanding virtue unknown to humanity by name, or for some human reason or other, but nevertheless have great glory in God’s sight. Or again, because there are many who have lived following Christ in India, Egypt, Arabia. Mesopotamia and Phrygia and in the lands beyond the Black Sea, even as far as the British Isles themselves; in short, in both East and West, but it was not easy to honour them all properly because of their vast numbers, in the way that ecclesiastical custom has been received. And therefore, so that we may attract the help of them all, wherever on earth they were well-pleasing to God, and generally for those who would later become Saints, the most godly Fathers ordained that we should celebrate the feast of All Saints, honouring the earlier and later ones, the unknown and the known — all those in whom the Holy Spirit has dwelt he has made holy.

A third reason is this. It was necessary for the Saints who are celebrated individually day by day to be gathered together on one day, in order to demonstrate that, as they struggled for the one Christ and all ran the race in the same stadium of virtue, so they were all fittingly crowned as servants of one God and sustained the Church, having filled the world on high. They stir us also to accomplish the same struggle in its different and many forms, to the degree of power that each of us has to press onwards with all eagerness.

For all these Saints from every age the revered and wise Emperor Leo erected and vast and very beautiful church. This is very near the church of the holy Apostles, within the city of Constantine. He built it originally, it is said, for his first wife Theophano, who was outstandingly well-pleasing to God, which was indeed a marvel in the midst of turmoil and in royal palaces. When he informed the Church of his idea, he did not succeed in making it agree with his wishes

The most wise Emperor, with the approval of the whole Church, dedicated to all the Saints everywhere in the world the building that had been erected, observing that ‘Since Theophano is a Saint, let her be numbered with the rest. ‘

Note that we are celebrating everything that the Holy Spirit, in giving good things, has made holy. I mean the highest and sanctifying Minds, that is to say the Nine Orders; the Ancestors and Patriarchs; the Prophets and sacred Apostles; the Martyrs and Hierarchs; the Priest Martyrs and Ascetic Martyrs; the Ascetics and the Just and all the choirs of holy women and all the other anonymous Saints, with them let there be all who will come afterwards. But before all, in all and with all, the Saint of Saints, the most holy and quite incomparably mightier than the angelic Orders, our Lady and Sovereign, Mary, Ever-Virgin.

At the prayers of your all-pure Mother, Christ God, and of all your Saints from every age, have mercy and save us, for you alone are good and love mankind. Amen.

****

Ode 7.

The ranks of Saints, as they praise in never silent hymns the One who rests among the Saints, now enjoy divine delight, and joyfully they dance and sing: Blessed is the God of our Fathers.

The companies of the Saints, suffused with divine rays of triple-sunned outpouring of light, devoutly proclaim a Unity in number three, the Father without beginning and the Son and the holy Spirit.

When you appear, O God, in your ineffable glory in the midst of the gods, granting to each their desserts and apportioning crowns, then count all worthy to sing to you: Blessed is the God of our Fathers.

With gladness let us make melody to the throng of all the Saints, welded together from every race and rank and way of life, and let us sing with them: Blessed is the God of our Fathers.

****

Theotokion.

All you maidens, having together formed a godly choir, cry out to Mary, the immaculate and all-holy Mother of God: Be glad, who made the source of our joy gush forth.

****

Ode 8.

Rejoice, Martyrs, Prophets, Apostles, honoured company of Martyr Priests, godly choir of the Just, of Ascetics and Teachers, who all make melody with the Myrrhbearing women: youths, bless; priests, praise; people, highly exalt him to all the ages.

Saints, who bear in yourselves the radiance beyond understanding and are filled with divine joy and gladness, you are called gods by your nearness to God; familiar with the rays which sanctify and enlightened by the beams of the ineffable glory, you highly Christ to all the ages.

Appearing as beacons with many lights, O Saints, you make the heaven of the Church radiant with gifts of grace of many kinds, and divers beauties; with justice, sobriety, courage and wisdom, as you cry: Priests, praise, people, highly exalt Christ to the ages.

****

Theotokion.

With joy all women wise in God and made perfect in Christ by the Spirit, as you now stand round the all-pure Virgin and true Mother of God, who ransomed us from the curse of our foremother Eve, hymn her fruit to the ages.

****

Ode 9.

The company of the elect, armed with the breastplate of hope and love and fenced about by faith, rejoiced as they nobly endured all the threats of tyrants, the tortures and scourges, for as outstanding witnesses of truth their wealth was Christ who gives victory in contests.

Let us now fittingly praise a haven of salvation, the Baptist, Apostles, Prophets and Martyrs, with Ascetics, godly Teachers and Priests, the company of Patriarchs and far-famed Martyr Priests, God-loving women, the holy and just.

Tested by the fire of temptations and not allured by pleasures, you rejoice sincerely, glorious company of the Saints, as you stand around the light-formed throne of the Master in heaven, now that mirrors have been abolished and shadow has passed away with the manifestation of the truth.

****

Theotokion.

You appeared as the one who unites things that were parted; for through you humans have truly become companions of the Angels in heaven, and now the ranks of all the Saints bear witness as they hymn your Offspring, Virgin Mother of God, in everlasting songs.

****

Exapostilarion 1, from the Oktoichos. Model melody. Tone 2. Another, of the Saints. Same melody.

Let us as is fitting crown with hymns the Baptist and Forerunner, the Apostles, Prophets, Martyrs, Hierarchs, Ascetics and Holy Ones, with Martyr Priests, God-loving Women and all the Just, and the ranks of Angels, imploring that we may attain the glory which they have from Christ the Saviour.

**Theotokion. Same melody.**

He who on high is divinely glorified by Angels, who ineffably was never parted from his Father’s bosom, O All-pure, lived among those below; while you, pure Maiden, became the cause of this salvation, who beyond reason lent flesh to him from your pure blood; beseech him to give your servants ransom of offences.

****

At Lauds we insert 8 Stichera, and sing 5 of the Resurrection and 3 of the Saints.

Tone 8. Model Melody.

Lord, though you stood at the judgement seat being judged by Pilate, yet seated with the Father you were not absent from your throne; and rising from the dead you freed the world from the slavery of the stranger, as you are full of pity and love mankind.

Lord, though Jews laid you as a corpse in a grave, yet soldiers were guarding you like a sleeping king, and they sealed you with a seal like a treasure-house of life; but you have risen and granted incorruption to our souls.

Lord, you have given us your Cross as a weapon against the devil; for he quails and trembles, unable to bear your power; for you raise the dead and have destroyed death: therefore we worship your Burial and your Rising.

Your Angel, Lord, proclaiming your Resurrection, filled the guards with fear, but he cried to the women and said: Why do you seek the living with the dead? Being God he has risen and given life to the whole world.

****

Another, by Anatolios.

Impassible in your Godhead, you suffered through the Cross; you accepted burial for three days to free us from the slavery of the foe; and having made us immortal to give us life through your Resurrection, O Christ God, the lover of mankind.

Prosomia of the Saints. Tone 4.

The Lord has made his Saints wondrous on earth; for they received his marks and sufferings in the flesh, adorned by them and manifestly arrayed in godlike beauties; whom let us hymn as unfading flowers, as unwandering stars of the Church, as willingly offered sacrifices.

****

Verse:

The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them; and rescued them from all their troubles.

Apostles with Prophets, Teachers with Ascetics, all the Just with Martyr Priests and those among women who struggled as Martyrs and lived the ascetic life with love, the multitude of the Saints and the ranks of the Just, let them be praised with sacred songs, as heirs of the kingdom on high and inhabitants of Paradise.

****

Verse:

God is wonderful in his Saints, the God of Israel.

The Martyrs made the earth heaven by the radiance of their virtues, they imitated the death of Christ, they trod the way which brings immortality, they purified the passions of mortals by the surgery of grace, they competed nobly with their whole soul in all the world: let them be praised.

Glory.
