<span style="font-size:24.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">DECEMBER 11TH </span>

SUNDAY OF THE HOLY FOREFATHERS
------------------------------

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">AT VESPERS</span>

**After the Opening Psalm we recite the whole of the 1st Kathisma of the Psalter.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;color:red">At ‘</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Lord, I have cried<span style="color:red">’, we insert 10 stichera, and sing 3 of the Resurrection, 3 by Anatolios and 4 Prosomia of the Forefathers. </span></span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;
color:red">Tone 8. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Today, as we celebrate the memorial of the Forefathers, let us the faithful raise a hymn to Christ the Redeemer, the Lord who magnifies them among all the nations, and faithfully performs extraordinary wonders, as he is mighty and powerful; and he showed forth from them a rod of power for us, pure Mary the Child of God who alone knew no man, from whom the flower, Christ, came forth, blossoming life for all and pleasure without cost and eternal life. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Master, who delivered the Holy Youths from the fire, and Daniel from the lions’ mouths; who blessed Abraham and Isaac your servant and his son Jacob; who were well pleased to be born from their seed for us, that you might save the Forefathers who had fallen away of old, to be crucified and buried, and you smash all the bonds of death, and you raise all who from every age were among the dead, who worship, O Christ, your eternal Kingdom. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">By the dew of the Spirit God’s Youths rejoicing as in rain walked mystically in the midst of the flame, typifying in advance the Trinity and Christ’s incarnation; and as wise through faith they quenched the power of fire. And the just Daniel appeared as a tamer of lions. Besought by their intercessions, O Saviour who loves mankind, deliver us also from the unquenchable and eternal fire, and make us worthy to gain your heavenly Kingdom. </span>

The faithful, Holy Youths in the furnace of fire, as in dew, mystically prefigured your coming from the Virgin, which shone forth without burning for us. And the just Daniel, wonderful among Prophets, clearly foreshowed your second divine coming when he cried: I see where thrones are set, and the judge has taken his throne, and a river of fire is present; from which at their intercessions may we be delivered, O Master Christ.

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Glory. <span style="color:red">Tone 6. By Anatolios.</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Let us the faithful today praise all the Fathers before the law: Abraham, God’s friend, Isaac, born by promise, Jacob and the twelve Patriarchs; honouring with them meek David and Daniel the Prophet of desires, and the three Children who changed the furnace into dew, asking forgiveness of Christ God, who is glorified in his Saints. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Both now. <span style="color:red">Theotokion. The 1st of the Tone of the Week.</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;
color:red">At the Aposticha the Resurrection stichera of the Tone. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Glory. <span style="color:red">Tone 3. By Germanos.</span> </span>

Come, lovers of festival, let us praise in song the gathering of the Forefathers: Adam the Forefather, Enoch. Noah, Melchisedek, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; after the law Moses and Aaron, Jesus, Samuel and David; with them Isaias, Jeremias, Ezekiel and Daniel, and the Twelve with Elias, Elisaius and them all; Zachary and the Baptist and all who proclaimed Christ, the life and resurrection of our race.

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Both now. <span style="color:red">Theotokion. The same Tone.</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">By the Father’s will without seed you conceived of the Holy Spirit the Son of God, who is from the Father without mother before the ages, but for us he came of you without father; you bore him in the flesh and suckled him as a babe; therefore do not cease to intercede that our souls may be delivered from dangers. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;
color:red">Apolytikion of the Resurrection. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Glory. Both now. <span style="color:red">Of the Forefathers. Tone 2.</span> </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">You justified the Forefathers by faith, through them betrothing in advance the Church from the nations. The Saints will exult in glory, for from their seed there is a glorious fruit, she who bore you without seed. At their intercessions, Christ God, save our souls. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;
color:red">And Dismissal. </span>
