**INTRODUCTION**

This Instruction is no. 14 of the *Large Catechesis*. The list in Migne is confused, since two instructions are numbered ‘7’. The title of the one for the Sunday of the Blind Man is the same as this one, and the reference to spring suggests that it the one meant.

LARGE CATECHESIS 14

**On freedom from affections and on self-mastery.**

My brothers, fathers and children, talking to you and seeing you is for me comfort and consolation, while I am convinced that your reciprocal love and sight of me is the same also for you, since after God I have no one else, not father, not mother, not brothers, not relatives, not friends, apart from you my most dear members and children and brothers and fathers, not have you any except me, an unprofitable sinner. This affiliation is of the Holy Spirit. Flight from the world, alienation, the denial of parents and all fleshly connections<sup>1</sup> have secured this union for us. Therefore this sacred fellowship is acknowledged to be one soul and one will for all. So then I rejoice each time I speak to you and address you, and am filled with zeal and am on fire for your love according to God and your salvation that your work as it progresses may progress, as it increases, may increase, as it shines, may shine to my inexpressible joy.

I beg you then, my children, now too stand steadfast and immovable from hope in God and by tearing apart the tangled wiles of the devil \[ Cf. Eph. 6:11.\] show yourselves to be above the passions as you trample down the pleasures and desires of the flesh and guard from every side your virginity and purity of soul and body. You realize that it is springtime when every animate nature is moved to reproduction. Let your sleep be in moderation, as I said to you before Easter, let your food be regulated as prescribed.<sup>2</sup> It is good, says the Apostle, not to eat meat or to drink wine, or do anything that makes your brother stumble.\[Rom. 14:21.\] And I too, my brothers, say by way of advice, not as a regulation, for the sake of your precious souls, not to the sick but to those who are in good health, it is good not to drink wine, particularly for the younger ones, for through wine the passions are enflamed. We have in ourselves the tempest of the physical pleasures; why then do we add the waves of wine to it? Taste therefore and see that self-mastery in this regard is good. \[Cf. Ps. 33:8.\] For you will see yourself by abstinence from wine rising above thoughts, freed from fever of the soul, awake to the love of God and aroused for those things that are better and abound in salvation. One who abstains from wine is filled with the Holy Spirit; one who drinks water has drunk the streams of compunction. However, as you are able, act thus to preserve your bodily health or in proportion to your toil; for I have not issued an order, but I am giving you advice in the matter. And with regard to foods, my children, I have the same advice, to flee irrational surfeiting and wanton indulgence, from which come dissolute behaviour and the seeds of Sodom.<sup>3</sup> But you are to act with regard to eating and drinking and everything else so as to rule and not be ruled by pleasures; so as to master and not be mastered by the flesh. And this is the best. This is the best formula for soul and body: for the better not be dominated by the worse. Be careful regarding journeys outside and worldly contacts not to bring disturbances to the brotherhood. And those of you who are assigned to the boats for going in and out and bringing in what is needed, do not associate with secular people, neither talk nor shout like them, but let your sailing<sup>4</sup> be seemly, so that God may be glorified by it.

I learn that some people are going down to the gardens and asking the gardener for vegetables to eat and that when, because of the rule, they do not get any, they pick a fight with the gardener. This is utterly satanic and is to occur no longer, since those of you who behave thus will be subjected to punishments. Is what is put before you not sufficient? How are you going to make war on passion if you are defeated by a cabbage? You will become weaker than a feather if you do not fortify yourself by thought through self-mastery. In short people both do become and have become perfect from imperfect, very great from small, healthy from weak, men from boys, and we too at least have become and let us continue to become and let us not be slothful, let us not be sluggish. The Lord gives strength and might. \[Cf Ps. 67:35.\] Spreading his wings he received them and took them on his back. \[Deut. 32:11.\] Thus he loves to save us, thus he is near to those that call on him. \[Ps. 144:18.\] Thus then the Lord of glory will comfort your hearts and firmly establish your souls and tightly gird your loins, beloved children, for the battle line, for war with the adversary, for victory, for the routing of opponents, for glory, for his praise, for inheritance of the kingdom of heaven, for to him belongs glory, with the Father and his all-holy and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

**NOTES**

<sup>1</sup> I take the Greek here to be masculine, not neuter, and to refer to ‘relatives’.

<sup></sup>

2

The word is not in the lexica, but the meaning is clear. This remark of St Theodore’s may explain why the normal fast days were prescribed from Thomas Sunday onwards. <sup></sup>

3

The adjective, sodomitikos, is not attested in the lexica. Here it is linked with asotia, which echoes the parable of the Prodigal Son. The elder brother in the parable asserts that his asotia includes squandering his money on harlots among other things. This suggests that the adjective also has sexual connotations. In view of St Theodore’s earlier remarks about spring this seems the most likely connotation of the word. <sup></sup>

4

Another unattested word.
