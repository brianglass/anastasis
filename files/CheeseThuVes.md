THURSDAY OF CHEESE WEEK
=======================

AT VESPERS
----------

****

At

Lord, I have cried **the Stichera from the Octoichos and the Menaion.**

At the Aposticha, the following Idiomel twice, said with the usual verses.

Tone 2.

The Cross of the Lord for those who worship it unswervingly is a bridle on every pleasure and a law of self-mastery. For as they gaze unceasingly on the One who was nailed to it, they crucify the flesh with its passions and desires. As we too hurry from them through pure fasting, let us become his own, who in love for humankind became our own by the passion and gave us a share in the nature of his own dispassion, he who has great mercy.

****

Verse 1.

To you I lift up my eyes, to you who are enthroned in the heavens. As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master: or as the eyes of a maid toward the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God: until he show us his mercy.

The Cross of the Lord for those who worship it unswervingly is a bridle on every pleasure and a law of self-mastery. For as they gaze unceasingly on the One who was nailed to it, they crucify the flesh with its passions and desires. As we too hurry from them through pure fasting, let us become his own, who in love for humankind became our own by the passion and gave us a share in the nature of his own dispassion, he who has great mercy.

****

Verse 2.

Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we have our fill of derision; our soul has its fill. Mockery for those at ease: and derision for the proud. ****

Of the Martyrs.

The Champions, who did not long for enjoyment on earth, were found worthy of heaven’s good things and have become fellow citizens of Angels. Lord, at their intercessions have mercy and save us.

Glory. Both now*.*

**Cross-Theotokion. When from the Tree.**

Pure Virgin, when you saw the ripe Grape Cluster that you had carried in your womb unhusbanded hanging on the Tree, lamenting you bewailed him and cried out, ‘My Child, drop down sweetness, through which may all the drunkenness of the passions be abolished, O Benefactor, by divine supplications through me who gave you birth, for you are compassionate’.

****

And the rest as on Tuesday.
