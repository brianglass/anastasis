INTRODUCTION

In this preliminary version of the texts for Matins and the Liturgy in Tone 8 I have included all the Irmi of the three canons. Those in square brackets are, of course, not normally sung, but are given here for convenience, since there are, as yet, no standard English incipits of such texts.

The Greek text of the canons presents a number of problems. The four printed editions I have used differ quite seriously in a number of places among themselves. I have also compared them with the Slavonic. The most inaccurate is that published by *Phos*,  which in one place even prints *Despoina*, ’Mistress’, where the reading should be *Despota,* ’Master’.

I hope before long to include elsewhere on these pages a PDF version of these canons with annotation .

AT MATINS

****

After the 1st Reading from the Psalter, Resurrection Kathismata.

Tone 8. Model Melody.

You rose from the dead, the Life of all, and an Angel of light cried out to the women: Cease your tears. Give the good tidings to the Apostles Cry aloud in hymns that Christ the Lord has risen, who as God was well-pleased to save the human race.

****

Verse:

Arise, O Lord, my God, lift up your hand: do not forget your poor for ever. ****

The Wisdom and Word.

When you had truly risen from the tomb you ordered the holy women to proclaim the Resurrection to the Apostles, as it is written; and Peter, coming at full speed, stood by the grave and seeing the light in the tomb was struck with amazement. And so he both saw the grave clothes lying there alone, without the divine body, and he believed and cried out: Glory to you Christ God, because you save us all, our Saviour, for you are the brightness of the Father.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. The same melody.**

Let us hymn the heavenly gate and ark, the all-holy mountain, the cloud of light, the heavenly ladder, the spiritual Paradise, the deliverance of Eve, the great treasure of the world; because salvation for the world and forgiveness of ancient offences were wrought in her; therefore we cry to her: Intercede with your Son and God to grant forgiveness of offences to those who devoutly worship your all-holy Offspring.

****

After the 2nd reading from the Psalter, other Kathismata.

Mortals sealed your grave, O Saviour; an Angel rolled the stone from the door; Women saw you risen from the dead, and it was they who gave the good tidings to your Disciples in Sion: The life of all has risen and the bonds of death are loosed. Lord, glory to you.

****

Verse:

I will give you thanks, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will tell of all your wonders.

The women who brought spices for the burial heard from the tomb an Angel’s voice: Cease your tears, and bring joy instead of sorrow. Cry aloud in hymns that Christ the Lord has risen, who as God was well-pleased to save the human race.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Because of you, O Full of grace, all creation rejoices, the ranks of Angels and the human race; hallowed Temple and spiritual Paradise, pride of Virgins; from you God was incarnate and he who is our God before the ages became a little child. For he made your womb a throne and caused it to become wider than the heavens. Because of you, O Full of grace, all creation rejoices; glory to you.

****

After Psalm 118, the Ypakoï

The myrrh-bearing women standing at the grave of the Giver of life were seeking the immortal Master among the dead; and when they received the good tidings of joy from the Angel they revealed to the Apostles that Christ had risen, granting the world his great mercy.

****

The Anavathmi. 1st Antiphon.

From my youth the enemy tempts me, enflames me with pleasures; but I, trusting in you, Lord, put him to flight.

Those that hate Sion, let them become like grass before it is dug up; for Christ will cut their necks with a sharp blade of torments.

Glory. Both now.

By the Holy Spirit all things live; Light from Light, great God: we sing his praise with the Father and the Word.

****

2nd Antiphon.

Let my humble heart be sheltered by fear of you; lest it fall away from you by being exalted, O most compassionate.

He who has his hope in the Lord will not be afraid when he judges all things by fire and punishment.

Glory. Both now.

By the Holy Spirit everyone that is godly sees and foretells and works the greatest wonders, as they sings one God in three Persons; for though it shines with triple light, the Divine rules as one.

****

3rd Antiphon.

I have cried to you, Lord, give heed, bend your ear to me as I call and cleanse me before you take me from what is here.

Each one who sinks back upon his mother earth will depart to receive torments or rewards for their life’s actions.

Glory. Both now.

By the Holy Spirit contemplation of God is of a thrice-holy unity; for the Father is without beginning, from whom was the Son beyond time, and the Spirit equal in form and majesty, shining forth equally from the Father.

****

4th Antiphon.

Behold, what so good, what so pleasant as brothers dwelling together? For by this the Lord promised eternal life.

The One who adorns the lilies of the field commands us not to be concerned over our clothing.

Glory. Both now.

By the Holy Spirit, by one single cause all things gain the reward of peace; for he is God exactly consubstantial with both the Father and the Son.

****

Prokeimenon \[Psalm 145\].

The Lord will be king for ever;\* your God, O Sion, to generation and generation.

****

Verse:

Praise the Lord, my soul: while I live I will praise the Lord; I will sing to my God for as long as I exist.

Let everything that has breath.

**The Sunday Resurrection Gospel.** Having seen the Resurrection. **Psalm 50.**

Resurrection Canon. Ode 1. Tone 8. Irmos.

Moses’ wonderworking staff, striking and dividing the sea in the figure of a cross, once drowned Pharao the charioteer, while it saved Israel the fugitive as he marched on foot, singing a song to God.

****

Troparia.

How can we not marvel at Christ’s all-powerful divinity? To the faithful it pours out dispassion from his passion, while from his holy side it sheds a fount of incorruption and from his tomb eternal life.

How glorious does the Angel now appear to the Women, wearing the bright symbols of innate and immaterial purity; while by his form he reveals the radiance of the Resurrection as he cries out, ‘The Lord has been raised!’

****

Theotokion.

Glorious things have been said of you in generation after generation, Virgin Mother of God, who, while remaining pure, contained in your womb God the Word. And so we all honour you as our protection after God.

****

Another Canon, of Cross and Resurrection. Irmos.

\[Crossing the water as on dry land and fleeing the harsh misery of Egypt, the Israelite cried aloud, To our Redeemer and our God now let us sing!\]

Hell’s gates of pain have been removed, its gatekeepers quailed in fear when they saw in the lowest depths the One who on high is beyond the nature of all things.

The ranks of Angels were amazed when they saw seated on the Father’s throne humanity’s fallen nature that had been held fast in the lowest depths.

\[Lord who constructed heaven’s vault and builder of the Church, establish me in your love, the pinnacle of all desires, the firm foundation of the faithful, only lover of mankind.\]

When of old I disobeyed your commandment, Lord, who made me, you made me a strange; having formed me and taught me obedience, reconciling me to yourself through the Crucifixion.

O Lord, who in wisdom knew all things beforehand and with understanding framed the things beneath the earth, in your condescension, Word of God, you did not disdain to raise up the one \[created\] according to your image.

****

****

Ode 4. Irmos.

\[You, Lord, are my strength and you are my power, you are my God and you are my joy, who did not leave your Father’s bosom and visited our poverty. Therefore with the Prophet Avvakoum I cry to you, ‘Glory to your power, O Lover of mankind!’\]

****

Troparia.

When I was hostile you loved me greatly. You came down to earth, compassionate Saviour, by a strange self-emptying, not spurning the indignity of my lowest state, and while remaining in the height of your ineffable glory, you glorified the one who had before been dishonoured.

Who now is not amazed, Master, as they see death destroyed through suffering, corruption taking flight through the Cross, Hell emptied of its wealth through death? This is the amazing action of your power, the Crucified lover of humankind.

****

Theotokion.

You are the boast of the faithful, Mother without bridegroom, you are the protection, you are the refuge of Christians, their wall and harbour; for you bring their entreaties to your Son, All-blameless Lady, and you save from dangers those who with faith and love acknowledge you to be the pure Mother of God.

Grant us pardon of our offences, as you are without sin, and give peace to your world, O God, at the entreaties of her who gave you birth.

****

Ode 5. Irmos.

Why have you, the Light that never sets, rejected me from your presence, and why has the alien darkness covered me, coward that I am? But turn me back to the light of your commandments and direct my ways, I implore.

****

Troparia.

You endured being wrapped in a cloak as you were mocked before your Passion, O Saviour, so covering the unsightly nakedness of Adam the First-formed, and being nailed naked to the Cross, stripping off, O Christ, the tunic of death.

Rising out of the dust of death, O Christ, you rebuilt my fallen being and rendered it unageing, displaying it again as a royal image, blazing with the light of incorruption.

The ranks of Angels and the companies of mortals worship your Offspring, Immaculate Mother of God.

Mary Mother of God without bridegroom, bring to naught the expectations of our foes and bring joy to those who sing your praise.

****

Ode 6. Irmos.

Have mercy on me Saviour, for my iniquities are many; and bring me up, I beg, from the deep of evils—for to you have I cried—and hear me, O God of my salvation.

****

Troparia.

Through a tree the author of evil mightily overthrew me, but raised on a Cross, O Christ, you hurled him down more mightily, humiliating him, while you raised the one who had fallen.

The Word of God revealed you to mortals to be a heavenly ladder, for through you he same down to us.

****

Kontakion. As first fruits of nature.

On rising from the grave you roused the dead and raised up Adam. Eve dances at your Resurrection, and the ends of the world keep festival at your Rising from the dead, O Most Merciful.

When you had ransacked the palaces of Hell and raised the dead, O Longsuffering, you met the Women bearing myrrh, bringing them joy instead of sorrow; and to your Apostles you revealed the symbols of your victory, my Saviour, giver of life, and you enlightened creation, lover of humankind. Therefore too the world rejoices at your Rising from the dead, O Most Merciful.

You have wrought salvation in the midst of the inhabited world, O God, as the Prophet said, for lifted up on a tree, you called back all those who cry to you with faith, ‘God of our Fathers, blessed are you!’

Rising from the tomb as from sleep, compassionate Lord, you raised the world with you, while creation was persuaded through the Apostles when they preached your Rising. ‘God of our Fathers, blessed are you!’

You appeared incarnate from a virgin womb for our salvation, and therefore knowing your Mother to be the one who gave birth to God, with thanksgiving we cry, ‘God of our Fathers, blessed are you!’

You are the all-blessed rod from Jesse’s root, O Virgin, and you blossomed with a saving fruit for those who with faith cry to your Son, ‘God of our Fathers, blessed are you!’

The Chaldean Tyrant insanely made the furnace blaze seven times more fiercely for those who reverenced God; but when he saw they had been saved by a greater power he cried aloud to the Creator and Redeemer, ‘O Youths, bless, you priests, praise, you people, highly exalt him to all the ages’.

****

Troparia.

The supreme divine power of Jesus’ godhead has shone out in what is ours in a manner fitting God: for having tasted death on a Cross in the flesh for all, he abolished the strength of Hell. Without ceasing, O Youths, bless, you priests, praise, you people, highly exalt him to all the ages.

The Crucified has risen, the boastful has fallen, the fallen and crushed has been set upright, corruption has been banished and incorruption has blossomed; for mortality has been swallowed up by life. O Youths, bless, you priests, praise, you people, highly exalt him to all the ages!

****

Triadikon.

Godhead of triple light, single radiance shining out from one three-personned nature, Begetter without beginning, Word of the Father, one with him in nature and kingship, consubstantial Spirit, O Youths, bless, you priests, praise, you people, highly exalt him to all the ages.

****

Ode 9. Irmos.

Heaven was amazed at this and the ends of the earth astounded: that God had appeared to mankind in bodily form, and that your womb had become far wider than the heavens. And so, Mother of God, the ranks of Angels and of humans magnify you.

****

Troparia.

Begotten simple in your divine nature that is without beginning, you became compound by assuming flesh, giving it substance in yourself, O Word of God, and having suffered as man, you remained beyond suffering as God, and so in two natures inseparably and unconfusedly we magnify you.

Your Father according to your divine nature, O Most High, when you became man, coming down to your servants, you addressed as God; having risen from the dead you made the One who is by nature God and Master, Father by grace of those born of earth. You with him we magnify.

****

Theotokion.

You appeared as Mother of God, O Virgin, when beyond nature you gave birth in the body to the good Word, whom the Father uttered from his own heart before all ages, as he is Good. Him we now understand to be beyond bodies, even though he is clothed in a body.

We know that you are Son of God by nature, conceived in the womb of the Mother of God, that you became man for our sake, and, as we see you on the Cross, that you suffer in your human nature, while as God you remain untouched by suffering.

Murky darkness has been abolished, for from Hell Christ, the sun of justice, has dawned enlightening all the ends of the earth, shining with the rays of his godhead, man from heaven, God on earth, whom in two natures we magnify.

****

Theotokion.

Bend your bow, prosper and reign, Son of the Mother of God, subduing the people of Ishmael who war against us, granting to our devout King the Cross as an invincible weapon,

The thought of you is full of joy and gladness, overflowing with healings for those who approach you and devoutly proclaim you Mother of God.

Fair is your fruit, Mother of God, no cause of corruption for those who partake, but of life for those who magnify you with faith.

****

At Lauds. Resurrection Stichera. Tone 8. Model Melody.

Lord, though you stood at the judgement seat being judged by Pilate, yet seated with the Father you were not absent from your throne; and risen from the dead you freed the world from the slavery of the stranger, as you are full of pity and love mankind.

Lord, though Jews had laid you as a corpse in a grave, yet soldiers were guarding you as a sleeping king, and they sealed you with a seal as treasure-house of life; but you arose and granted incorruption to our souls.

Lord, you have given us your Cross as a weapon against the devil; for he quails and trembles, unable to contemplate your power; for you raise the dead and made death of no effect: therefore we worship your Burial and your Rising.

Your Angel, Lord, proclaiming your Resurrection, filled the guards with fear, but he cried to the women and said: Why do you seek the living with the dead? Being God he has risen and given life to the whole world.

****

Others by Anatolios.

You suffered through the Cross, who are impassible in your Godhead; to free us from the slavery of the foe you accepted burial for three days, and, having made us immortal, to give us life through your Resurrection, Christ God, lover of mankind.

I worship, I glorify and I praise your Resurrection from the tomb, O Christ, through which you have freed us from the unbreakable bonds of Hell and as God granted the world eternal life and your great mercy.

Lawless men, watching over your grave, which had received life, sealed it; but you, as immortal and all-powerful God, rose on the third day.

When you entered the gates of Hell, Lord, and smashed them, the prisoner cried out: Who is this, for he is not condemned to the lowest parts of the earth, but has torn down death’s prison-house like a tent? I received him as a mortal, and I tremble at him as God. All-powerful Saviour have mercy on us.

Glory.
