****

Of the Martyrs.

Breathing as one, looking to one end the victorious Martyrs found one road of life, death for the sake of Christ, as they emulated each other’s end - O the wonder! - grasping tortures like treasures, they said to one another: Should we even now not die, we shall most surely die, and by birth we shall serve what is due; let us perform the duty which loves honour, purchasing life with death. At their prayers, O God, have mercy on us.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.** **Today Judas watches. Σήμερον γρηγορεῖ.**

Alas, I have became a haunt of pleasures, wretch that I am! Therefore I ever appear a laughing-stock to my foes; therefore I fall down before you, holy Virgin; see my tribulation, offer me help, cleanse me by tears and deliver me, I pray, O Pure one, and let those who rejoice at my destruction be put to shame.
