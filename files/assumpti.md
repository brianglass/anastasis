THE ASSUMPTION

OF OUR LORD AND GOD AND SAVIOUR
JESUS CHRIST
===============================

**ON WEDNESDAY OF THE 6TH WEEK**

AT SMALL VESPERS
----------------

**At** Lord, I have cried **we insert 4 stichera of the Feast**.

****

Tone 6

The Lord has been taken up into heaven, that he may send the Advocate to the world. The heavens have prepared his throne; clouds his ascent. Angels marvel to see a human high above them. The Father receives him whom he holds eternally in his bosom. The Holy Spirit orders all his Angels, ’Lift up our gates, you rulers’. All you nations, clap your hands: for Christ has gone up where he was before.

Lord, at your Assumption the Cherubim were amazed as they contemplated you, the God who is seated upon them, ascending on the clouds; and we glorify you, for your mercy is kind. Glory to you!

As we see your exaltation on the holy mountains, O Christ, the splendour of the Father’s glory, we hymn the appearance, formed of light, of your countenance; we worship your sufferings, we honour your Resurrection, as we glorify your glorious Assumption. Have mercy on us.

Lord Christ, giver of life, as your Apostles saw you borne up on clouds, filled with lamentations of tears of dejection, grieving they said, ’Master, do not make us your servants orphans, whom through pity you have loved as you are compassionate; but, as you promised, send us your all-holy Spirit to guide our souls with light’.

Glory. Both now.

**Same Tone**

Lord, as you completed the mystery of your dispensation and took your Disciples with you, you took them up onto the mount of Olives; and see, you passed through the firmament of heaven. For me you became poor like me, you also ascended whence you had not been parted; send forth your all-holy Spirit, to enlighten our souls.

****

At the Aposticha. Tone 1.

In ascending to heaven, Lord, whence you also descended, do not leave us orphans; may your Spirit come, bringing peace to the world; show to the children of humankind deeds of your power, O Lord who loves humankind.

****

Verse:

God has gone up with a shout of joy; the Lord to the sound of the trumpet.

You have ascended, O Christ, to your Father who is without beginning, yet you were never parted from his bosom which is uncircumscribed; and the heavenly powers accepted no addition to the thrice-holy hymn of praise, but acknowledged you, Lord, as one Son, only-begotten of the Father, even after the incarnation. In the multitude of your pity, have mercy on us.

****

Verse:

All nations, clap your hands; shout to God with a voice of gladness.

Your Angels, Lord, said to your Apostles: Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up to heaven: This is Christ God, who is taken up from you into heaven; he it is will come again in the same way that you have seen him going to heaven; serve him in holiness and justice.

Glory. Both now.

**Tone 2.**

You were born, as you yourself willed; you appeared, as you yourself wished; you suffered in the flesh, O our God; you rose from the dead, having trampled on death; you were taken up in glory, who fill the universe, and you sent us the divine Spirit, that we might hymn and glorify your Godhead.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 4.

You were taken up in glory, Christ our God, giving joy to your Disciples by the promise of the Holy Spirit, when through the blessing they had been assured that you are the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world.

AT GREAT VESPERS

****

After the Opening Psalm, at

Lord, I have cried**, we insert 10 stichera, and we sing 5 Idiomels, doubling them.**

Tone 6

The Lord has been taken up into heaven, that he may send the Advocate to the world. The heavens have prepared his throne; clouds his ascent. Angels marvel to see a human high above them. The Father receives him whom he holds eternally in his bosom. The Holy Spirit orders all his Angels: Lift up our gates, you rulers. All you nations, clap your hands: for Christ has gone up to where he was before. (

**Twice**)

Lord, at your Assumption the Cherubim were amazed as they contemplated you, the God who is enthroned upon them, ascending on the clouds; and we glorify you, for your mercy is kind. Glory to you! (

**Twice**)

As we see your exaltation on the holy mountains, O Christ, the splendour of the Father’s glory, we hymn the appearance, formed of light, of your countenance; we worship your sufferings, we honour your Resurrection, as we glorify your glorious Assumption. Have mercy on us. (

**Twice**)

Lord Christ, giver of life, as your Apostles, filled with lamentations of tears of dejection, saw you borne up on clouds, grieving they said: Master, do not make us your servants orphans, whom through pity you have loved as you are compassionate; but, as you promised, send us your all-holy Spirit to guide our souls with light. (

**Twice**)

Lord, as you completed the mystery of your dispensation, taking your Disciples with you, you took them up onto the mount of Olives; and behold, you passed through the firmament of heaven. For me you became poor like me, and you ascended whence you had not been parted; send forth your all-holy Spirit, to enlighten our souls. (

**Twice**)

Glory. Both now.

**The same Tone.**

Most sweet Jesu, not parted from the Father’s bosom and having lived among those on earth as man, to-day you have been taken up in glory from the mount of Olives, and having through compassion exalted our fallen nature, you have seated it with the Father. Therefore the heavenly ranks of the Bodiless Powers, amazed by the wonder, were beside themselves with fear; and seized with trembling they magnified your love for humankind; while we, as we glorify your being taken up from us, implore you and say: you filled the Disciples and the Mother of God who bore you with joy at your being taken up; at their prayers make us too worthy of the joy of your elect through your great mercy.

****

Entrance,

O joyful Light**, Prokeimenon of the day, and the Readings.**

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Isaias.
\[**2,2-3\]**

Thus says the Lord, It shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, and the house of God from the peaks of the mountains; and it shall be exalted high above the hills; and all the nations shall come to it; and many peoples shall walk there, and shall say: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will declare his way to us, and we will walk in it.

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Isaias.
\[**62,10-63,3; 7-9\]**

Thus says the Lord: Walk, go through my gates; prepare my way and make a way for my people, and cast the stones out of the way; raise up a standard for the nations. For see, the Lord has made it heard to the ends of the earth: Say to the daughter of Sion: See, your Saviour has come, and his reward is with him, and his work before his face. And he will call it a holy people, redeemed by the Lord; while you will be called a city sought after, and not forsaken. Who is this who comes from Edom, the scarlet of his garments from Bosor, thus beautiful in his apparel? He cries out with much strength. I reason of justice and judgement of salvation. Why are your garments red, and your clothing as from a trodden winepress? I am full of the trodden grape; I have trampled the winepress quite alone, and no man from the nations was with me. I have remembered the mercy of the Lord, I will recall the Lord’s virtues, the Lord’s praise for all the things with which He rewards us. The Lord is a good judge for the house of Israel; he deals with us according to his mercy and according to the multitude of his justice. And he said: Are you not my people? Children will surely not be rebellious; and he became for them salvation out of their every distress. It was not an emissary, not an Angel, but the Lord himself saved them because he loved them and spared them. He redeemed them and took them up and exalted them all the days of the age.

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Zachary.
\[**14,4; 8-11\]**

Thus says the Lord: See, the day of the Lord is coming, and on that day his feet will stand upon the mount of Olives, opposite Jerusalem, where the sun rises. And on that day living water will come out from Jerusalem, half towards the first sea and half towards the last sea; in spring and in summer it shall be so; and the Lord will be for a King over all the earth; in that day there shall be one Lord, and his name, compassing all the earth and the wilderness from Gabaa as far as Remmon, south of Jerusalem; and he shall be exalted and remain on his place from the gate of Benjamin as far as the place of the first gate, as far as the gate of Gomor and as far as the tower of Anameël and as far as the tower of the corners and as far as the king’s winepresses; they shall dwell in it and there shall be no more curse and Jerusalem shall dwell confidently.

****

At the Liti, Idiomel Stichera.
Tone 1

In ascending to heaven, Lord, whence you also descended, do not leave us orphans; may your Spirit come, bringing peace to the world; show to the children of humankind deeds of your power, O Lord who love humankind.

****

Same Tone

You have ascended, O Christ, to your Father who is without beginning, yet you were never parted from his bosom which is uncircumscribed; and the heavenly powers accepted no addition to the thrice-holy hymn of praise, but acknowledged you, Lord, as one Son, only-begotten of the Father, even after the incarnation. In the multitude of your pity, have mercy on us.

****

Same Tone.

Your Angels, Lord, said to your Apostles: Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up to heaven: This is Christ God, who is taken up from you into heaven. He it is will come again in the same way that you have seen him going to heaven; serve him in holiness and justice.

****

Tone 4.

When you came to the mount of Olives, O Christ, to fulfil the Father’s good pleasure, the Angels of heaven were amazed and those beneath the earth shuddered in fear; the Disciples stood by trembling with joy as you spoke to them; as a throne a waiting cloud had been prepared opposite them, while heaven opening its gates appeared in beauty, and the earth reveals its hidden vaults, so that Adam’s descent was made known and his ascent again. But your footsteps were raised up, as if by a hand, while your mouth was heard loudly giving a blessing; a cloud received you and heaven took you within. You wrought this great and marvellous work, Lord, for the salvation of our souls.

****

The same Tone.

O God, having renewed in yourself Adam’s nature, which had descended to the lower parts of the earth, you took it up to-day above every rule and authority; as you loved it, so you made it sit with you; as you had compassion on it, so You united it to Yourself; as united with it, so you suffered with it; as not subject to suffering, yet you suffered and glorified it with yourself. But the Bodiless powers were saying: Who is this man of beauty? Not man only, but both God and man, both together they appear. And so the astonished Angels flying in shining robes cried out to the Disciples: Men of Galilee, this Jesus who has gone from you as man and God, will come again as God-man, judge of living and dead, granting the faithful remission of sins and his great mercy.

****

The same Tone.

When you were taken up in glory, Christ God, while your Disciples watched, the clouds received you with your flesh; the gates of heaven were lifted up; the choir of Angels rejoiced with gladness; the higher powers cried out, saying; Lift up our gates, you rulers, and the King of glory will enter. While the Disciples, amazed, were saying: Good Shepherd, do not be parted from us, but send us your all-holy Spirit, to guide and strengthen our souls.

Glory. Both now.

**The same Tone**

O Lord, when as you are good you had fulfilled the mystery hidden from ages and generations, you came with your Disciples to the mount of Olives, having with you her who bore you, the Maker and Creator of all things; for it was necessary that she who had suffered so greatly as a mother at your passion, should also be filled with joy beyond measure at the glory of your flesh. We too sharing in the joy of your ascent to heaven, O Master, glorify your great mercy which has come to us.

****

At the Aposticha, Idiomel Stichera. Tone 2.

You were born, as you yourself willed; you appeared, as you yourself wished; you suffered in the flesh, O our God; you rose from the dead, having trampled on death; you were taken up in glory, who fill the universe, and you sent us the divine Spirit, that we might hymn and glorify your Godhead.

****

Verse:

All you nations, clap your hands; shout to God with a voice of gladness.

As you were taken up from the mount of Olives, the powers seeing you cried one to the other: Who is this? And they were told: This is the Mighty One, the Powerful, this is the Powerful in war, this is truly the King of glory. And why are your garments scarlet? He has come from Bosor, that is, from the flesh. But as God seated at the right hand of the Majesty you have sent us the Holy Spirit, to guide and save our souls.

****

Verse:

God has gone up with a shout; the Lord with the sound of the trumpet.

You were taken up in glory from the mount of Olives, Christ our God, in the presence of your Disciples, and took your seat at the Father’s right hand, filling the universe with your Godhead; and you sent them the Holy Spirit who enlightens and strengthens and sanctifies our souls.

Glory. Both now.

**Tone 6.**

God has gone up with a shout, the Lord to the sound of the trumpet, to raise up Adam’s fallen image and send the Advocate Spirit to sanctify our souls.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 4

You were taken up in glory, Christ our God, having made the Disciples joyful with the promise of the Holy Spirit; through the blessing they were assured that you are the Son of God, the redeemer of the world. (

**THURSDAY OF THE ASSUMPTION**

AT MATINS
---------

****

After the 1st reading from the Psalter, Kathisma.
Tone 1. When the stone had been sealed.

While Angels marvelled at the strangeness of your ascent and Disciples were amazed at the awe-inspiring nature of your lifting up, you went up as God with glory, and the gates were lifted up for you, O Saviour; therefore the powers of heaven marvelled as they cried aloud: Glory to your descent, O Saviour! Glory to your kingdom! Glory to your Assumption, only lover of humankind!

****

After the 2nd reading from the Psalter, Kathisma.
Tone 3. Awed by the beauty.

The God before the ages and without beginning, having made divine the human nature that he had taken up, has been taken up to-day. Angels hastening forth showed him to the Apostles as he went into heaven with great glory; and worshipping him they said: Glory to God who has been taken up!

****

After the Polyeleos, Kathisma.
Tone 5. Let us believers.

When you came down from heaven to things on earth and as God raised up with you Adam’s nature which lay below in Hades’ prison, you brought it to heaven by your Assumption, O Christ, and made it sit with you on your Father’s throne, as you are merciful and love humankind.

Then the following Idiomel in Tone 6.

Verse:

Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with your great mercy; and according to the multitude of your mercies blot out my offences.

To-day, seeing our nature in the heavens, the Powers above, marvelling at the strange manner of the ascent, in their perplexity said to one another: Who is this who comes? But even as they saw their own Master they were being given orders to raise the heavenly gates. With them we unceasingly hymn you, who are coming from there again in the flesh as Judge of all and all-powerful God.

A Composition of Joseph of Thessaloniki.
I will open my mouth.

Immortal by nature, you arose on the third day and appeared to the Eleven and to all the Disciples, and riding on a cloud you hastened back to the Father, O Christ, Maker of the universe.

Into knowledge of the Spirit, giving praise with songs inspired.

By the power of your Cross, O Christ, establish my understanding to hymn and glorify your saving Assumption.

The ranks of Angels, as they saw your mortal nature going up with you, O Saviour, were astounded and without ceasing sang your praise.

The choirs of Angels were amazed, O Christ, as they saw you being taken up with your body, and they sang the praise of your holy Assumption.

Mounted on the clouds of heaven, leaving behind your peace to those on earth, you went up and sat down on the Father’s right hand, as consubstantial with him and the Holy Spirit; for you appeared in the flesh, yet remained unchanged; therefore you await the final consummation, when you are coming on earth to judge the whole world. O Lord, just judge, spare our souls and grant forgiveness of offences, as God who has mercy on your servants. (

Strange was your Birth, strange your Resurrection, strange and fearful your divine Assumption from the mount, O Giver of life, of which Elias was an icon when he went up in a four-horse chariot, singing your praise, O Lover of humankind.

When you had fulfilled the dispensation for our sake and united things on earth with things in heaven, you were taken up in glory, Christ our God, in no way divided, but remaining inseparable, you cried to those who loved you, ‘I am with you, and there is no one against you.’

****

The Ikos

Abandoning on earth the things of earth, leaving to the dust the things of ash, now, let us come to our senses and raise on high our eyes and minds. Mortals, let us make our sight together with our senses fly heaven’s gates. Let us imagine we are standing on the Mount of Olives and that we bend our gaze on the Redeemer, as he rides up on a cloud. For, from where the Lord has hastened back to heaven, there too the One who loves to give has distributed his gifts to his Apostles, cherishing them as a father and confirming them, guiding them as sons and saying to them, ‘I am not parting from you. I am with you, and there is no one against you.’

****

Synaxarion from the Menaion, then the following:

On the Thursday of the sixth week from Pascha, we celebrate the Assumption of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ.

****

Verses

Seated, O Word, upon the Father’s right,
Granting Initiates a surer faith.

**When he was with his Disciples before his passion, he promised them the coming of the all-holy Spirit, saying, ‘It is right that I go away. For if I do not go away, the Paraclete will not come’. And again, ‘When he comes, he will teach you all truth,. Therefore, after rising from the dead, he appeared to them for forty days, not the whole time, but at intervals, eating and drinking with them, proving the resurrection more surely. Finally, after promising many things about the kingdom of God, he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there to receive the coming of the all-holy Spirit, and they would also be baptised through him. For they had formerly only been baptised in water by John (though later Epiphanios of Cyprus recounted that John the Theologian baptised the Mother of God, while Peter and he baptised the rest of the Apostles). He ordered them to remain in Jerusalem so that the first proclamation of the Gospel might be confirmed there, lest, by leaving for foreign places, they might be easily misrepresented. And because it was necessary, as it is for soldiers, for them to be armed with the weapons of the Spirit and so go out to battle with the enemies of Christ.**

**When the moment came for the assumption, he led them out to the Mount of Olives (so called because it was planted with many olive trees). He talked with them of the preaching to the ends of the earth and also of his perpetual kingdom that was to come, and when he saw that they were about to ask him what was fitting, his most pure Mother being present also, he brought Angels to show them his ascent to heaven. And indeed, as the watched, he was lifted up from among them and a cloud received him. And so, escorted by the Angels, who exhorted one another to raise the doors of heaven and were amazed at scarlet of his flesh from his blood, he ascended and took his seat at the right hand of the Father, making his flesh divine and, I dare to say, making it equal to God. Through it we have been changed, now that the ancient enmity has been abolished. However, Angels appeared to the Apostles, in the form of men, and said, ‘Men of Galilee, why do you stand amazed, straining your gaze to heaven? The one whom you see in flesh, God Jesus, will come like this again in flesh. But not as before, in poverty and unknown, but with great glory, as you now see him, escorted by Angels’.**

**Then the Apostles, tired by gazing up, returned from the Mount of Olives, which is very near Jerusalem, about two thousand four hundred steps, for this is a Sabbath day’s journey. For so it was laid down by Moses as lawful to walk for this distance on Sabbath. Because the Tent of Witness was this number of steps distant from the Jewish camp. So it was possible for worshippers to go this far on Sabbath and not to walk further. And so it called a Sabbath day’s journey. Some have though because of this that Christ’s Assumption took place of Sabbath, which is incredible.**

**The Apostles, having returned, went up into the Upper Room, where they remained with the Myrrhbearing Women and the Mother of the Word, devoting themselves to fasting, prayer and supplication, waiting for the promised descent of the all-holy Spirit.**

Christ our God, taken up in glory, have mercy on us. Amen.

****

Ode 7. Irmos

You saved the Youths who sang your praise in the furnace of fire; blessed are you, the God of our fathers.

****

Troparia

You were taken up on a cloud of light and saved the world; blessed are you the God of our fathers.

Lifting up on your shoulders the nature which had been led astray, O Christ, you were taken up and brought it to God the Father.

You ascended in the flesh to the bodiless Father; blessed are you the God of our fathers.

Lifting up our nature which had been slain by sin, O Saviour, you brought it to your own Father.

****

Theotokion.

You were born from a Virgin, whom you made Mother of God; blessed are you the God of our fathers.

****

Inspires with reverence to cry: Only Trinity,
Equal in strength, without beginning, blessed are you.

As the Angels saw in the height your flesh now made divine, O Christ, they signalled to one another: Truly this is our God.

As the ranks of bodiless powers, Christ God, saw you being lifted up on clouds, they cried: For the King of glory lift up the gates.

As the One who descended into the lowest part of the earth, saved humankind and raised it up by your ascension, we magnify you.

For every fluent, every eloquent mouth
With oratory has not the strength to sing you worthily;

Your giving birth; therefore with one accord we glorify you.

Let us in the world keep festival like the Angels, for God who is borne upon a throne of glory, as we cry aloud the hymn: Holy are you, heavenly Father; holy are you, co-eternal Son; holy are you, all-holy Spirit.

The princes of the Angels, Saviour, as they saw the strangeness of your ascent, were perplexed and said to one another, ‘What is this sight? Human he seems in form, yet as God he ascends with a body far above the heavens’.

Verse:

My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will sing and chant in my glory.

The Reading is from the Acts of the Apostles.

**1, 1-12**

In the first book, Theophilos, I dealt with all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. He presented himself alive to them by many proofs after his passion, appearing to them during forty days, and speaking about the kingdom of God. And while staying with them he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, ‘which’, he said, ‘you heard from me, for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.’ So when they had come together, they asked him, ‘Lord, is this the time when you are going to restore the kingdom to Israel?’ He said to them, ‘It is not for you to know times or moments which the Father has fixed by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the very ends of the earth.’ And when he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, who said, ‘Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you have seen him go into heaven.’ Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away.
