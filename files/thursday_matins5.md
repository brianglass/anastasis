ON THURSDAY MORNING

AT MATINS

****

After the 1st reading from the Psalter, Kathismata of the Apostles.

Tone 5.

*Τὸν συνάναρχον Λόγον.*

All we faithful, let us praise as eye-witnesses of the Word and servants of Christ the wise Apostles in spiritual songs and hymns; for they insistently intercede with Christ on behalf of us who hymn their sacred memory and worship their relics.

Let us harmoniously praise the Apostles as those who preached the sure and orthodox teaching of the Lord, drove out the fog of heresies and made spiritual illumination, the grace of doctrines shine forth in the world; and who implore that our souls may be saved.

Glory. Both now*.*

**Theotokion. Same melody.**

Bride who knew not wedlock and ever virgin, we praise you with the godly eye-witnesses; because in you the Mighty One has done great things, your Son and God, who was from eternity from the Father, who dwelt in your womb and was well-pleased to be born that he might save our race from error.

****

After the 2nd reading, others.

*Τὸν συνάναρχον Λόγον.*

Let us praise the Apostles in hymns as eye-witnesses and godlike heralds of the Word, as clearly spiritual fishers of the nations, because they brought us to knowledge of Christ, delivering the human race from error and made it worthy of the Kingdom.

Disciples of the Saviour, godlike Apostles, who sowed the saving word to the ends of the earth, and shone on those who were sitting in darkness and the shadow of death, by your intercessions, O all-wise, enlighten my soul darkened by the blackness of the passions.

Glory. Both now*.*

**Theotokion. Same melody.**

Immaculate Virgin, who are the protection of those who in you have gained hopes from the soul, free us from temptations and troubles and dire dangers, O Pure one, and with the Apostles intercede with your Son that all who hymn you may be saved.

****

After the 3rd reading, others.

*Κύριε, τὸ ποτήριον τοῦ πάθους σου.*

Lord, those who lacked wisdom put to shame the lovers of wisdom by proclaiming the mystery of your incarnation; fishermen stopped the mouths of orators and became the wise Teachers of the nations, who enlightened the ends of the earth with the light of divine knowledge; through them give us your great mercy.

****

Of the Martyrs. Model melody.

*Κύριε, τὸ ποτήριον τοῦ πάθους σου.*

Lord, the Champions filled with the desire for the cup of your suffering abandoned all the pleasure of life and have become companions of the Angels. At their entreaties grant our souls forgiveness of sins and your great mercy.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.** *Τὸν συνάναρχον Λόγον.*

Show to your servant your rapid protection and help and mercy; and calm the waves of vain thoughts, pure Mother of God, and raise up my fallen soul; for I know that you, O Virgin, have power to do whatever you will.

****

Having displayed an angel’s life on earth, now with the Angels you stand in holiness before the throne of the Trinity asking for us release from our sins and temptations, Father and Hierarch Nicolas.

Drive away the dark clouds of my mind by your light-bearing prayers, Father Nicolas; abate the tempest of the passions; pilot me, Father, to the harbour of dispassion, I implore, that I may glorify you in praise.

From infancy you rose to the Lord at dawn, Venerable Father, and became all radiant of the light that poured from there. Therefore drive away the clouds from my soul.

We implore you at this hour, Father Nicolas, be in the midst of all who call on you, granting us our requests that bring salvation.

Venerable Shepherd, we entreat you, the great sun of Christ’s Church, that is fixed on high, with shining lamps of light banish the darkness of sin from our souls.

The glorious day of Christ’s Coming is at hand, as it written. Sterile soul, cast off sloth and fervently cry out to Christ, ‘Lord, save me at Nicolas’ entreaties!’

Aposticha of Lauds, of the Apostles.

Disciples of the Saviour, when you had become eye-witnesses of mysteries you proclaimed the One who is not seen and who has no beginning, saying, ‘In the beginning was the Word’. You were not created before the Angels, you did not learn from men, but from the wisdom from on high. And so as you have freedom to speak, intercede on behalf of our souls.

Let us praise harmoniously in songs the Apostles of the Lord; for clothed with the panoply of the Cross they destroyed the error of idols and were declared crowned victors; at their intercessions, O God, have mercy on us.

****

Of the Martyrs.

As they were being tortured the Saints rejoiced and cried out: These are contracts for us with the Master; for instead of the stripes which assail the body, he will place on us a garment of light at the resurrection; instead of prison cells there will be Paradise; and instead of condemnation with malefactors, life with the Angels. At their prayers, Lord, save our souls.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

You who were chosen beforehand, hearken to our voice, and grant our souls our requests; deliver us from passions and pains through the Apostles; as Mother of God you can do all things.
