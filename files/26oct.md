NOTE
----

This translation is not yet complete and omits the Canon for the Earthquake and the second one for the Saint. I hope to complete it before too long.

Commemoration of the holy Great Martyr Demetrios, Myrovlitis; and remembrance of the earthquake that took place.

AT VESPERS
----------

**After the Opening Psalm we say the 1st section of** Blessed is the man.

****

At

Lord, I have cried**, we insert 6 Stichera and sing the following Prosomia of the Saint.**

Tone 8. O marvellous wonder!

O marvellous wonder! In heaven and on earth joy has dawned bright today at the commemoration of the Martyr Demetrios; from the Angels he is garlanded with praises, and from humans he receives songs. O how he struggled! How well he competed! Through him the cunning foe has fallen and Christ has conquered.

O marvellous wonder! By the beams of his wonders Demetrios shines for ever through the ends of the earth more brightly than the sun, shining from the light that knows no evening, and taking his pleasure in the light that never sets; by his rays barbarian clouds have been dispelled, diseases chased away, demons defeated.

O marvellous wonder! Thrice-blessed Demetrios, transfixed by a lance for the sake of Christ, has appeared each day like a two-edged sword against foes, as he cuts of the arrogance of enemies and breaks in pieces the insolence of demons. To him let us cry out: Holy Demetrios, protect us who ever honour your all-revered memory

You appeared as a tower of true religion, firmly established on the rock of the faith, not captured by temptations and not shaken by dangers; for the waves of the godless breaking against you with violent swell and tempest did not cast down your unshakeable firmness; for you longed to be adorned with a martyr’s crown.

Imitating by suffering the suffering of Christ, you have received from him, glorious Champion Demetrios, the power to work wonders; and you save those who have recourse to you, delivering them from many dangers, as you have well-pleasing boldness towards Christ; before whom you now stand, filled with glory.

Dripping with your own blood, Demetrios, you were offered to Christ the Giver of life who emptied out his precious blood for your sake; and he made you a sharer in his glory, a companion in his kingship, for you had won the victory against the boaster and completely quenched his dread devices.

Glory.

**Tone 6. By Vyzantios.**

To-day the universal festival of the Champion calls us together. Come then, lovers of feasts, let us radiantly celebrate his memorial, as we say: Hail, who tore apart the tunic of impiety through the faith, robing yourself in the courage of the Spirit! Hail, who destroyed the purposes of the lawless with the strength given you by God! Hail, who when your limbs were pierced by the lance depicted for us spiritually the blessed passion of Christ! Implore him, Demetrios, ornament of Athletes, that we may be rescued from visible and invisible foes, and that our souls may be saved.

Both now.

**Theotokion. To the melody: Fearful are you, O Lord.**

All-holy Lady, help of the world and hope of Christians; we now entreat and implore you, loving Mother of God, on behalf of us who have sinned and are in despair, to make your Son and Lord merciful; for by using your mother’s boldness you have this power. Come quickly, O Immaculate, come quickly, intervene, and deliver your people from the impending threat; in your compassionate mercy do not despise those who sing your praise.

****

Entrance,

O Joyful light. **Prokeimenon of the day, and the Readings.**

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Isaias.
\[

**63:15-19 & 64:1-5 and selection**\]

Look down from heaven, Lord, and see from your holy house and your glory. Where is the multitude of your mercy and your pity, that you keep back from us, O Lord? For you are our Father, though Abraham did not know us, though Israel did not acknowledge us; but you are our Father, deliver us. From the beginning your name is upon us. Why have you made us wander from your way, Lord? Why have you hardened our hearts not to fear you? Turn back for the sake of your servants, for the tribes of your inheritance, that we may inherit a small part of your holy mountain. Our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary. We have become as at the beginning, when you did not know us, when your name had not been invoked upon us. If you open the heaven, trembling will take hold upon mountains from you, and they will melt as wax melts before the fire; and fire will burn up your enemies, and your name will be manifest to your enemies; before your face nations will be troubled. When you do glorious things trembling from you will seize mountains. From eternity we have not heard, nor have we seen a God save you; and your works are true, and you do mercy to those who wait on you. For mercy will meet those who act justly, and they will be mindful of your ways. And now, Lord, your are our Father, while we are your clay and you are our Fashioner; we are all the works of your hands; do not be very angry with us, Lord, and do not remember our sins in season. And now look upon, Lord, for we are all your people.

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Jeremy.
\[

**2:1-12**\]

Thus says the Lord: I have remembered the mercy of your youth and the love of your marriage, in your following the Holy One of Israel, says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel. For the Lord the first of his produce. All that devour him shall offend; evils will come upon them, says the Lord. Hear the word of the Lord, house of Jacob and all the family of the house of Israel. Thus says the Lord: What offence did your fathers find in me, that they rebelled far from me and went after vanities and became vain? Nor did they say: Where is the Lord, who brought us up from Egypt, who guided us in the wilderness, in a vast and trackless land, in a waterless and fruitless land, and in the shadow of death? In a land in which no man had ever journeyed, nor had any human dwelt there? And I led you into Carmel, to eat its fruits and its good things. And you entered and defiled my land, and you turned my inheritance into an abomination. Your priests did not say: Where is the Lord? And those who stood by the law did not know me, and the shepherds sinned against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal and went after what is profitless. Therefore I will dispute with you again, says the Lord, and I will dispute with your children’s children. Pass through the isles of the Kittim and see; send to Kedar and observe closely, and see if such things have been done; if the nations will change their gods - and they are not gods. But my people has changed their glory for that from which they get no profit. Heaven is amazed at this and shudders greatly with horror, says the Lord.

The Reading is from the Wisdom of Solomon.
\[

**3:1-9**\]

The souls of the just are in the hand of God, and no torment will ever touch them. In the eyes of fools they seemed to have died, and their departure was reckoned a disaster, and their going from us their destruction; but they are in peace. For though in the sight of mankind they were punished, their hope is full of immortality. And having been disciplined a little, they will receive great good; because God tried them and found them worthy of himself. He proved them like gold in a furnace and accepted them as whole burnt offering. And at the moment of their visitation they will shine out, and they will run like sparks through stubble. They will judge nations and hold sway over peoples, and the Lord will be their king to the ages. Those who have trusted in him will understand truth; and the faithful in love will abide with him; because grace and mercy are upon his holy ones, and his visitation upon his chosen.

At the Liti, Idiomel Stichera.
Tone 1. By George Sikeliotes

Rejoice in the Lord, city of Thessaloniki; be glad and dance, resplendent by faith, for you possess as a treasure in your bosom Demetrios the all-renowned Athlete, and Martyr for the truth; look and receive healings of wonders; and see how he strikes down the insolence of the Barbarians, and with thanksgiving cry out to the Saviour: Lord, glory to you!

****

The same tone. By Anatolios.

With the charm of songs let us make bright the present day, and let us make the struggles of the Martyr resound; for the great Demetrios is proposed for our praise. For bravely overpowering the attacks of tyrants, he leapt keenly into the stadium; and having triumphantly carried off the victory, he implores the Saviour that our souls may be saved.

Glory.

**Tone 2. By Germanos.**

Christ God has taken your blameless spirit, wise Martyr Demetrios, to the dwellings beyond the world; for you became a champion of the Trinity, competing bravely in the stadium like tempered steel; pierced by a lance in your spotless side, O all-honoured, you imitated the One who was transfixed on a tree for the salvation of all the world; you received the power of healings and grant mortals cures without grudging. And so today, as we feast your falling asleep, we fittingly glorify the Lord who glorified you.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

O greatest mystery! Seeing the wonders I proclaim the divinity, I do not deny the humanity; for Emmanuel opened the gates of nature as man, yet as God did not break the seals of virginity; but he came from the womb as he had entered through the hearing; as he had been conceived, so he became incarnate. Impassibly he entered, ineffably he came forth, as the Prophet had said: This gate shall be shut, none shall go through it, except the Lord, the God of Israel, who has great mercy.

****

At the Aposticha, Idiomel Stichera of the Earthquake.
A composition of Symeon of the Wonderful Mountain.
Tone 2.

When the earth was troubled in fear of your rage, hills and mountains were shaken, Lord; but having looked upon us with an eye of compassion, in your anger do not be enraged at us; but with compassion for the creation of your hands free us from the dread threat of earthquake, as you are good and love mankind.

****

Tone 6.

Verse:

You shook the earth and troubled it.

Fearful are you, Lord, and who can stand against your just rage? Or who can entreat you, or who can supplicate you, good Lord, on behalf of a people that has sinned and is in despair? The heavenly armies, Angels, Principalities and Powers, Thrones, Dominions, the Cherubim and the Seraphim cry out to you on our behalf: Holy, Holy, Holy are you, O Lord; do not despise the works of your hands; through your compassionate mercy save a city endangered!

****

Verse:

Who looks upon the earth and it trembles.

The Ninevites by their transgressions heard they would be submerged through the threat of earthquake; but by the mediating sign of the whale, repentance summoned resurrection through Jonas; but as you took pity and accepted them, at the cry of your people with the children and beasts, through your Resurrection on the third day spare us too who are being punished, and have mercy.

Glory.

**Of the Saint. Tone 8. By Anatolios.**

Your most godlike and blameless soul, revered Demetrios, has her dwelling in the heavenly Jerusalem, whose walls have been adorned by the hands of the invisible God. While on earth this famous temple holds your all-honoured and most valiant body, an inviolate store house of treasures, a remedy for diseases; to it we have recourse and draw healings. Guard the city which magnifies you, All-praised, from assaults of foes, for you have boldness towards Christ who glorified you.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Virgin without bridegroom, All-blameless Mother of God, who ineffably conceived God the Most High in the flesh, receive the entreaties of your servants; you grant cleansing of faults to all; now accept our supplications and implore that we may all be saved.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 3. Your confession.

The whole world has found you as a mighty champion in dangers, O victor, who rout the nations. Therefore as you destroyed the pride of Lyaios in the stadium by giving Nestor courage, holy great Martyr Demetrios, implore Christ God to grant us his great mercy.

****

Another. Of the Earthquake. Tone 8.

Christ our God, who look upon the earth and make it tremble, deliver us from the dread threat of earthquake; and send down upon us your rich mercies, at the prayers of the Mother of God, O lover of mankind.

****

The same are also said at

The Lord is God.  

AT MATINS

****

After the 1st Reading from the Psalter, Kathisma.

Tone 4. Speedily anticipate.

Your memory, glorious Martyr Demetrios, has today made Christ’s Church radiant, and gathered all together to praise you fittingly in songs, O God-inspired, as a true soldier and destroyer of foes. And so by your intercessions deliver us from temptations.

Glory. **Same melody.**

Martyr Demetrios, pride of the contest, having put on Christ, you defeated in war the enemy without strength. For having destroyed the error of the lawless, you have become a trainer of true religion for those with faith. And so we reverently keep the festival of your memory.

Both now. **Theotokion.**

Hope that cannot be put to shame of those who trust in you, who alone beyond nature bore in the flesh Christ our God, with the Holy Apostles entreat him to give the inhabited world pardon and peace, and to us all before the end amendment of life.

****

After the 2nd Reading from the Psalter, Kathisma.

Tone 5. Let us believers praise.

With unwavering faith Christ’s Champion bravely cast down the insolence of tyrants, like an athlete he threw the evil one, and as the reward of his torments he received the gift of wonders from the judge of the contest, the only God; with whom he also intercedes to have mercy on us.

Glory.

**The same.**

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Hail gate of the Lord, though which none may pass; hail wall and protection of those who flee to you; hail haven without storms, and who did not know wedlock, who bore in the flesh your Maker and God, do not cease to intercede for those who praise and worship your Offspring.

****

After the Polyeleos, Kathisma.
Tone 3. Awed by the beauty.

We implore you faithfully Demetrios, most compassionate Martyr of the Lord, to deliver us from dangers of every kind that assail us; heal the wounds of our souls and bodies; tame the proud ragings of our foes, O Saint; give peace to our life, that we may ever glorify you.

Glory.

**The same.**

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Blessed of God, Mother without bridegroom, heal my sick soul, for I am held fast by many faults, O Mother of God. Therefore I cry to you with groaning of my heart: Accept me who have greatly sinned, O All-immaculate, that with boldness I may cry to you: Hail, Full of grace.

****

Both now.

At the prayers of the Mother of God O Merciful One, blot out the multitude of my transgressions..

****

Verse:

Have mercy on me, O God, according to your great mercy; according to the fulness of your compassion blot out my offences. ****

And the Idiomel. Tone 2.

Christ God took your blameless spirit to tabernacles beyond the world, wise martyr Demetrios,; for you became a champion of the Trinity, competing bravely like adamant in the stadium. Pierced in your immaculate side by a lance, imitating the one who was stretched upon a tree for the salvation of all the world, you received the power of wonders, granting healings to mortals ungrudgingly. And so today, as we celebrate your falling asleep, we fittingly glorify the Lord who glorified you.

****

Then the Canons; that of the earthquake with the Irmi to 6; those of the Saint to 8.

**\[The Canon of the Earthquake, of which the Acrostic is:
**O Christ, earth’s tremors end with speed Joseph.\]

****

First Canon of the Saint, of which the Acrostic is:

I address triumphant Demetrios. ****

By Theophanes.

Ode 1. Tone 4. Through the Red Sea’s deep.

Bound with the godly crown of martyrdom, you dance before God, blazing with the lighting that flashes from him and filled with enlightenment, revered Martyr Demetrios.

As Martyr for the truth and one who bravely struggled to shedding of blood and displayed an flinching stand in face of struggles, the Master accepted you.

Down to the ground you broke the inventor of wickedness, Demetrios, destroying him by your martyr’s lance of godlike goodness, strengthened for this by the powers beyond discernment.

****

Theotokion.

As God he was before without mother; as one like us he became without father from you, all-praised Mother of God, taking flesh in the union which is beyond reason and understanding.

**\[Second Canon of the Saint, of which the Acrostic is:**
Adorned with spiritual myrrh, you become myrrh.

****

In the Theotokia:

By Philotheos.\] ****

Katavasia

I will open my mouth. ****

Ode 3. First Canon of the Saint.
Your Church, O Christ.

The decree of the tyrants was reckoned by you as nothing, O Champion, for you chose before all things the Word of God.

You have become a lampstand formed of light in a tabernacle of Martyrdom, shining by divine light, Martyr and Champion Demetrios.

****

Theotokion.

Healing the form of mortals that had been corrupted, O All-pure, he clothed himself in it from you, yet remaining what he was, the Lover of mankind.

****

Katavasia.

O Mother of God. ****

Kathisma of the Saint. Tone 8. The Wisdom and Word.

Rich in the ways of true religion, casting down the error of false religion, you trampled down the insolence of the tyrants, O Martyr; and with your mind on fire with divine love, you drowned the error of idols in the deep. Therefore you fittingly received wonders as the reward of your struggles and are a source of healings. Champion Demetrios, intercede with Christ God to grant forgiveness of faults to those who celebrate with love your holy memory.

Glory.

**Another of the Saint.**

Well-pleasing to the King of the ages, you turned away the whole plan of a lawless king, glorious Martyr, and did not sacrifice to idols. And so, by contesting most valiantly, you offered yourself as a sacrifice to the Word who was sacrificed. Therefore you were also pierced through the side by the lance, healing the passions of those who approach you. Champion Demetrios, intercede with Christ God to grant forgiveness of faults to those who celebrate with love your holy memory.

Both now.

**Of the Earthquake. Tone 4. Lifted up on the Cross.**

Because from your unendurable wrath that threatened us you have delivered us and had mercy on us, showing us, O Christ, an ocean of love for mankind, we now give you thanks, having been chastised so as to turn from our wicked deeds that slay us. But look upon us, have compassion on us, O Saviour, at the entreaties of the one who gave you birth.

****

Ode 4. First Canon of the Saint.
Seeing you the Sun of justice.

The most high Word of God, seeing you had conquered the falsehood of impiety, crowned you with glory, Demetrios, as you sang: Glory to your power, O Lord.

Given strength by the life-bearing hand, you reached the meadows of great calm, where now with gladness you cry out, Demetrios: Glory to your power, O Lord.

Having raised up a trophy against error, you received a victorious diadem of justice, Demetrios, as you cried out: Glory to your power, O Lord.

****

Theotokion.

You alone, Mother of God, were counted worthy to be more sacred than all creatures, for by giving birth to him you enlightened the world with the grace of knowledge of God.

****

Katavasia.

The Prophet Avvakoum. ****

Ode 5. First Canon of the Saint. You, Lord, are my light.

Having received in your heart the fire of divine love, you quenched the fire of the godless folly of idols, revered Demetrios.

Appear, Demetrios, delivering us from dangers by your prayers, sheltering those who with faith and love sing your praise.

Those who with faith press forward to your shrine, Demetrios, are instantly delivered from diseases and soul-destroying passions.

****

Theotokion.

The Word of God, consubstantial with the Father, O Mother of God, beyond understanding and reason became your Son, consubstantial with you.

Ode 6. First canon of the Saint. I will sacrifice to you.

Assembled with one accord, we sing the praise of your light-bearing memory, most blessed Demetrios, and the multitudes of the wonders and gifts of grace of the Holy and revered Spirit.

Loose the bonds of my faults by your prayers, for as an unconquerable Martyr you have freedom to speak before the Master. And be for me refuge an protection, Demetrios.

****

Synaxarion,

On the 26th of the month, Commemoration of the holy and glorious Great Martyr Demetrios, Myrovlitis and Wonderworker.

****

Verses.

Lances, my Christ, pierce through Demetrios,
Tracing the passions of your lance-pierced side.
Spears on the twenty sixth day pierced the side of the martyr Demetrios.

He lived in the reign of the Emperors Diocletian and Maximianos and was from the city of Thessalonika, a devout Christian from the start and a teacher of the faith in Christ. But when Maximianos visited Thessalonika, the Saint was arrested as being well known for his beliefs. The Emperor was extremely proud of a certain Lyaios and urged the people of the place to come out and meet him in combat (Lyaios was a man of huge stature and excelled in strength those who came agaisnt him). A certain young man, Christian by faith, named Nestor, went to Demetrios, who was in prison, and said, ‘Servant of God, I intend to compete aginst Lyaios. But pray for me.’ Demetrios signed his forehead with the sign of the Cross and said, ‘You will both beat Lyaios and bear a Mertyr’s witness for Christ.’ At these words Nestor took courage and opposed Lyaios, cast down his arrogant boasting and slew him.

Because of this the Emperor was humiliated and after investigation having found out what had happened, he gave orders that first Demetrios should be run through in the side with lances, as he was the cause of Lyaios’ slaughter. This being done the Saint at once gave up his life and after his death became the cause of many wonders and cures. Then, at the Emperor’s order, Saint Nestor was beheaded.

On the same day the holy Martyrs Artemidoros and Basil attained perfection by the sword.

****

Verses.

Artemidoros, for whom end was sword,
Had Basil as his fellow for the sword.

On the same day the holy Martyr Leptina was dragged down into the ground and attained perfection.

****

Verses.

Dragged to the ground by hands of hostile men,
Leptina \[thin\] left to earth the bulk of flesh.

On the same day the holy Martyr Glykon attained perfection by the sword.

****

Verses.

Glykon, you stretched your neck out o sword,
Pouring for Christ your blood as sweet \[glykeia\] libation.

On the same day, Commemoration of the great and terrible earthquake.

****

Verses.

You shook, but saved again the earth, O Word;
For of your anger pity is the sum.

In the twenty fourth year of the reign of Leo the Isaurian, in the ninth Indiction, on the 26th of October, there was a great and terrible earthquake in Constantinople, so that the upper stories and the more splendid of the other buildings collapsed and many people were buried under the ruins. And so on the day of the Great martyr Demetrios we commemorate that terrible threat of the earthquake, going in procession to the church in Vlachernae of our all-pure, holy and glorious Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, where we celebrate the divine Liturgy. At her prayers may we be delivered from every threat and attain eternal good things, in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory and might to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Ode 7. First Canon of the Saint. The Children of Abraham.

Ablaze with divine glory and grace, Martyr and Champion, you shine as though formed of light, and you enlighten those who cry: Blessed are you, Lord, in the temple of your glory.

Ode 8. First Canon of the Saint. Stretching out his hands.

You darkened all the folly of the foe and all his wrestler’s tricks, girded with the indestructible power of Christ, and having become a victor, glorious Martyr Demetrios, you cried out: All you his works, praise the Lord!

Showing the constancy of martyrs, you gained fair fame, Demetrios, have bathed in the holy bath that is not defiled by the renewed assaults of sins, pierced by a lance and crying out: All you his works, praise the Lord!

The multitude beyond understanding of the wonders that Christ granted you freely, glorious Martyr, you display for all; and grace of healings beyond reason that is clearly yours, proclaims grace to us who cry: All you his works, praise the Lord!

****

Theotokion.

Let us confess her who alone in all generations is Virgin-Mother and pure Mother of God; for she is the cause of salvation for us, since she gave birth to the Word, the Redeemer of the world, to whom we cry: All you his works, praise the Lord!

****

Katavasia.

The Offspring of the Mother of God. ****

Ode. 9. First canon of the Saint. A stone not cut by human hand.

Break the bonds of the faults of those who sing your praise, O Champion. End the assaults of the passions; abolish the folly of heresies; calm the storm of temptations by your intercessions.

Direct your most sacred flock to the straight paths of the heavenly kingdom, crowned victor, Martyr Demetrios, onto the saving pasture and the place that is everlasting.

****

Let all born of earth. ****

Exapostilarion. With the Disciples.

Martyr of Christ, Demetrios, as once by divine grace you destroyed the arrogance and pride of Lyaios and his stallion’s insolence by strengthening Nestor in the stadium by the power of the Cross, so strengthen me also by your prayers, O Champion, at all times against demons and soul-destroying passions.

****

Theotokion.

Immaculate Virgin-Mother, do not cease to implore the Lord who was incarnate from your pure blood on behalf of us who are your servants, that we, the race of mortals, may find grace and prompt help in time of need, rescuing us from the threat of fearsome earthquake and from dangers by your mother’s prayers.

****

At Lauds we insert 4 Stichera and sing three Prosomia, doubling the first.

Tone 5. Hail, of ascetics.

Come to us, Martyr of Christ, as we implore your compassionate protection, and deliver those in trouble from the threats of tyrants and the dread folly of heresy, by which. like prisoners and naked, we are continually pursued from place to place, passing and wandering in caves and mountains. Take pity, then All-praised, and give us relief; end the tempest and assuage the pain that harms us, as you intercede with God, who grants the world his great mercy.

You have been given to us as a fortified wall that does not tremble at the siege engines of the foe, for you render ineffective the assaults of the barbarians and the symptoms of all diseases. You are an invincible rampart and unbreakable foundation, defender, builder and champion for your city, Demetrios. By your prayers, All-blessed one, save it now dreadfully endangered and wretchedly afflicted, as you implore Christ, who grants the world his great mercy.

The choir of Champions is displayed having gathered every virtue; therefore they worthily inherited the delight of the pure and blessed life. Among whom, worthy Demetrios, you are pre-eminent, honoured by your imitation of Christ and glorified for being like him pierced with a lance. Ask him insistently that we who honour you may be delivered from sufferings and dread disasters, as you fervently entreat the One who grants the world his great mercy.

****

Glory. Tone 4. By Andrew of Jerusalem.

Let us all honour Demetrios, wisest in teachings and victor among Martyrs, who by lances inherited the grace from the Saviour’s side that was pierced by the lance, from which the Saviour pours out for us streams of life and incorruption. Through blood he finished the course of his contest and shone for all the inhabited world by wonders, zealous for the Master and compassionate lover of the poor; many times the defender of the people of Thessalonika in many dread dangers. As we celebrate his yearly memorial, we glorify Christ God, who works through him healings for all.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Deliver us from our constraints, Mother of Christ God, who gave birth to the Maker of all things, that we may all cry to you: Hail, the only defence of our souls.

****

Great Doxology and Dismissal.

Holy myron from the Saint is given, while his Idiomels are chanted.
