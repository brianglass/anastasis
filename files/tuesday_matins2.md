After the 1st Reading from the Psalter Kathismata of Compunction.

Tone 3.

As you sojourn on earth, my soul, repent; dust in tomb does not sing hymns, is not delivered from faults; cry out to Christ God: Knower of hearts, I have sinned; before you condemn me, spare me, O God, and have mercy on me.

For how long, my soul, will you remain with your faults? Until when will you delay repentance? Call to mind the judgement to come, cry out to Christ God: Knower of hearts, I have sinned; sinless Lord, have mercy on me!

Glory, Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Mother of God, our refuge and power, the mighty help of the world, by your intercessions protect your servants from every constraint, O only blessed one.

****

After the 2nd Reading from the Psalter, others.

Lord, you know the depth of my faults; give me your hand as you did Peter and save me.

When the just judgement comes upon you and the Judge of all is passing sentence, what defence will you give, my soul, unless before the end you cry: I have sinned, O God, and have mercy on me!

Glory, Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Mother without bridegroom, blest by God, heal my feeble soul, for wretch that I am I am held fast by faults; therefore I cry out with the groaning of my heart: Accept me, O All-spotless, who have much offended, that with boldness I may cry to you: Hail, full of grace.

****

After the 3rd Reading from the Psalter, others.

As we flee to your protection we cry out with faith from the depth of the soul: Prophet and Forerunner, blest by God, calm the tumult of trials and dangers and the swell of vices, and bring to naught the plans of foes, as you for us God’s great mercy.

As All-powerful you have made the memory of your Champions radiantly bright, Lord, for you gave them strength to imitate your sufferings; bravely they conquered the power of Beliar; therefore they have received gifts of healings. At their supplications, O Merciful, grant peace to your people.

Glory, Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Wherever each is saved, there rightly too he runs; and what other such refuge have we as you, O Mother of God, who protect our souls?

****

Canon of Compunction, whose acrostic is:

Attend to my groanings, O Word of God. Joseph.

****

Ode 1. Tone 3. The Irmos.

You are God, wonderful in working marvels, who turned the deep into land, drowned chariots and saved a people who sang to you as God our Redeemer.

****

Troparia.

Let us ever weep for ourselves, brothers, from our whole soul; the Bridegroom is at hand, let us light up our actions like shining lamps, that we may gain here the divine bridal chamber.

Of old, when he repented from his whole soul, Manasses was saved; for he cried out, held in the midst of bonds, to the only Master; rival him, O soul, and you will easily be saved.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Gouging out of eyes, loss of hands, cutting out of tongues, removal of feet, thighs and arms, the godlike Champions endured and gave thanks to Jesus Christ.

The casket of your relics, Martyrs, has appeared to us as a place of healing for all the faithful, from which we draw strength of souls and bodies, for as is right we ever honour you.

****

Theotokion.

Spiritual Jar, who carried Christ the manna of immortality, deliver me from the bitterness of soul-destroying passions, All-holy Virgin, that with faith I may devoutly glorify you.

****

Another Canon, of the honoured Forerunner.

Godly shoot of a barren womb intercede with God to make me bring forth shoots of virtues, destroying the gloom of my fruitlessness and driving away the darkness from my mind, O Forerunner of the Lord.

Like a great star running before the Sun of justice, who gives radiance to the whole earth, you appeared on earth; implore him then, O Forerunner, to enlighten my soul darkened by paltry pleasures.

To those in hell you foretold by the divine Spirit the life that was near at hand, by your entreaties, O Prophet, give life to my deadened soul and raise it I beg as from a tomb of faults, glorious Forerunner.

****

Theotokion.

With the Archangels, with the Angels and with all the Saints, O Virgin, ask the Lord who appeared from you, we beg, to deliver from dangers those who confess you as true Mother of God.

Ode 3. The Irmos.

Sterile and barren soul, procure fair fruit and blessed with children cry out: I have been established through you, O God; none is holy, none is just but you, O Lord.

****

Troparia

Without conscience I have set aside God’s law and am about to be condemned, and I know not what to do; Most just Judge, take pity, save me in your compassion.

Lover of mankind, you are the Dayspring from the East, dawn for me, I pray, with the light of justice, rescuing me from the blackness of the passions and the darkness of punishments, O you of many mercies.

****

Of the Martyrs.

You have been revealed, O Martyrs, as inhabitants, fruitful trees of the spiritual Paradise, springs of divine water, mixing bowls who pour out holy drink.

The triumphant Martyrs with but a single thought in many bodies, wounded the myriad hosts of the hostile ruler of the world as they proclaimed the undivided Trinity.

****

Theotokion.

Immaculate Virgin Mother, grant that we who repent and have recourse to Christ and wish to find release from faults may find him merciful, O sovereign Lady.

****

Of the Forerunner.

You became the voice of the Word, O Baptist; now direct the voices of those who honour you, and grant us forgiveness of faults by your mediation.

I have sinned against you, I have broken your law, I have dreadfully offended, O Saviour, and I have befouled my soul; and so I beg, through your Baptist, take pity on me.

As I wander in the desert of pleasures I beseech you, O Forerunner, offspring of the desert and guide of the new people, guide me to the way of repentance.

****

Theotokion.

The shaded mountain Avvakoum foresaw as your immaculate womb, O Pure one; and so too he cried out: God will come from Theman, and the Holy One from a shaded, wooded mountain.

****

Troparia.

Christ, who of old made water spring from a rock for disobedient and disputatious people, make water, cure for thirst, gush from my parched soul, O God, washing me with drops of compunction.

Physician of the sick, heal the passions of my heart with the compassionate weight of repentance, fashioning a healing plaster, O Good One, and giving me strength of soul in your pity.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Freed from the yoke of the thought of sympathetic friendship for the body, O Champions, you handed yourselves over to those who wished to punish you, that you might be declared true friends of the Creator.

Foot soldiers of Christ, you endured many painful hurts from many forms of torture, and you received the grace from the gifts of the Spirit to drive from us the enduring pains of the passions. Theotokion.

Maiden of many titles, hail, from whom the Word was born, abolished the absurdities of our foul actions; hail Cloud of light who scatters the clouds of our despair.

****

Of the Forerunner.

Forerunner of the Lord, I beseech you, voice of the Word who appeared in the flesh, deliver from irrational deeds one who honours you with words and with faith fittingly calls you blessed.

Groan my soul, and cry to God your Creator: I have sinned, be merciful, O Christ, and deliver me from fearful punishment, from dangers and troubles at the godly prayers of the Forerunner.

As I drown in the many waves of fierce passions, and am storm-tossed and ever continually drowning, snatch me out, O Baptist, and guide me to the roadstead of salvation.

The bruises of my wretched soul have festered, O Word; Physician of the weak, Giver of good things, heal, save me through your great mercy.

****

Of the Martyrs.

On earth the Champions’ vessels of clay were crushed, but their force of soul was most mighty and radiant by the power of Christ.

The blood of the saints, poured out, has sanctified the whole earth, watered souls and clearly dried up the muddy streams of vain idolatry.

****

Theotokion.

By your child-bearing, O Maiden, you scattered the curse of the Forefather like seed, and you became a source of rivers of blessing for us who bless you and glorify you with faith.

****

Of the Forerunner.

On earth, blest Saint, you lived clearly like an Angel in the flesh; and so I beg you, free from soul from fleshly thoughts.

Forerunner of the Lord, save me from falling into the depth of sin, from being fouled in soul by pleasures and from being endangered, as I have recourse to you.

****

Theotokion.

You appeared wider than the heavens as truly Mother of God, Virgin full of God’s grace; free me from sin that hems me round.

****

Ode 6. The Irmos.

A deep of the passions has risen against me and tempests of contrary winds; but do you come before me and save me, and deliver me from corruption, as you saved the Prophet from the beast.

****

Troparia.

I have become dulled by the gloom of sin and I lie wholly inactive; Christ God, who were once pierced by a lance for my sake, take pity on me in your compassion.

Sick with insensibility I groan, yet remain in wickedness; I weep yet do not tremble at the judgement; take pity on me, Word of God, and save me by your good judgements.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Like lambs without striving, uttering neither word nor sound, all-famed Athletes, you were led to the slaughter as you hymned Christ.

With joyful soul you were given over as fodder to wild beasts, you were acquainted with the depths of the sea; and so Christ adorned you, O Athletes, with incorruptible crowns of victory.

****

Theotokion.

O you the door of those who are saved by faith, the gate through which alone has passed he was incarnate for us, open the gates of justice to us who sing your praise with faith.

****

Of the Forerunner.

With water you baptised the stream of delight as he bent beneath your hand; but implore him to send down to me, who have much offended, water of compunction, Wise Baptist.

In a river, O Prophet, you wash the abyss of mercy who roofs the heavens, his upper chambers, with waters, Jesus the lover of mankind; beseech him to rain forgiveness on me.

The Kingdom of heaven has drawn near, repent, you cried, O Forerunner; make those worthy to reach it who honour you with love and who take refuge under your revered protection.

****

Theotokion.

Immaculate, who lent your flesh to the Creator, with the Powers above, with all the Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs, intercede with him to take pity and save me.

****

Ode 7. The Irmos.

You turned the flame of the furnace to dew and saved the Youths unburned; blessed are you to the ages O Lord, the God of our Fathers.

****

Troparia.

I was stripped of the tunic of incorruption, but put on deeds of dishonour; and so I cry out to you, O merciful God: Make me bright with robes of virtues.

I have been defiled by intemperate eyes, I have been fouled the touch of incontinence, and I have become abominable before you, O Jesu: Accept me as the Prodigal.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Loving a greater life, you bore greater toils, O Foot Soldiers of Christ, godlike beacons; and so with faith we call you blessed.

Radiant with the beam of tortures, you blazed more brightly than the sun and you dispelled all the fog of godlessness, holy Martyrs.

****

Theotokion.

As she who bore him who holds all things fast, release me from the fog of ignorance and sin which holds me fast, pure ever Virgin.

****

Of the Forerunner.

Lamp of the Sun shine on my soul, quenched and blinded by sloth, and guide me towards paths of repentance, O Baptist and Forerunner of the Lord.

As I think on the hour of the judgement I am wholly filled with fear, enveloped in a multitude of shameful deeds; Baptist of the Saviour, stand by me to deliver me from the fire that awaits me.

O Forerunner, defender of my life, my helper, guard and protect me from my enemies both visible and invisible, and make me a partaker in the Kingdom of heaven.

****

Theotokion.

Virgin Mother of God, implore your Son, with Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs, to rescue us who ever honour you, from the duress to come.

****

****

Troparia.

Because I do not have the fear of you dwelling in my heart, I have without conscience committed every sin of the flesh, and I tremble at your sentence, Universal King; do not despise me as I now repent.

Grant that I may tread the holy earth, which the meek inhabit, washing me clean by repentance of earthly sin, O Most Merciful, who were born without sin upon earth of a Virgin.

****

Of the Martyrs.

You bathed your feet in your own blood, tripping foes by the heel and in holiness making a pathway to heaven, O all-famed Champions of Christ the God of all.

Keenly you undressed for the greatest contests and you stripped the foe naked and dressed him in shame; and so wearing crowns you dance in the heavens, famed Champions of Christ.

****

Theotokion.

The Lord, fair in beauty, loved you the beauty of Jacob and dwelt in your womb, O All-blameless, making the nature of humanity radiant with the beauties of gifts beyond understanding.

Of the Forerunner.

You proclaimed the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of mankind, godlike Prophet John, beseech him to loose the burden of my sins and make me worthy of the portion of the saved.

Rescue me, who am wholly gripped by the darkness of evil deeds, from the burning furnace of flame and from the lightless exterior darkness, I beseech you, O Word of God without beginning, through your glorious and godlike Baptist.

Godlike Prophet of the Lord, who proclaimed fruitfulness through repentance to dried up desert souls, purify my soul, by every pleasure bearing thorns, that I may sprout a full ear of good works.

****

As Mother of God, with the holy Angels, with Prophets, Apostles and the Martyrs, implore him to deliver from dangers, tribulations and the punishment to come all those who ever confess you as Mother of God.

Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, who has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, through the compassion of his mercy, by which he, the Dayspring from on high has visited us, and guided us into the way of peace.

****

Troparia.

See, an acceptable time and a day of mercy; be willing to turn back then, O soul, producing the fruit of repentance, lest the fearful axe of death find you fruitless, and like the fig tree of old cut you down and cast you into fire in the other world.

As once the Rich Man I delight myself with pleasures and have no compassion at all for my neighbour; and so, Master, wash my stony soul that even at the end I who am darkened may shine with compassion.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Godly Martyrs of Christ, signed in blood, you steadfastly by signs wounded unbelieving foes and snatched many peoples from impious error with godly conversions, made radiant with the light of the knowledge of God.

You appeared as sharpened swords cutting down the ranks of the foe, godly Athletes of Christ, and as vessels containing the gleam of the Holy Trinity, and as torches afire with the light of true religion by faith, and as true foot soldiers of the spiritual glory.

****

Theotokion.

The prophet foresaw you as the cloud of light from which appeared the great Sun, Christ God, and enlightened things which before were darkened; implore him then, good Lady, to dispel the clouds of my passions and to make me bright with divine light.

****

Of the Forerunner.

Emerging from the shadow of the law, you richly contemplated the radiance of divine grace, which leads all the fullness of the to the light, wise Prophet, and dispels the darkness of ignorance; therefore we honour you.

As Martyr of Christ, Baptist of God, lamp of repentance, dawn of true religion, mediator of the old and new testaments, through divine knowledge make new my lowly soul, made old by wickedness, and lead it to the light.

At the dread hour, at the fearful hour, at the hour of sentence deliver me, wise Forerunner, as I am being judged, from the threat that awaits me there, for you have, as his friend, one who answers your requests, the Bridegroom, the Saviour of our souls.

****

Theotokion.

As Mother of God, as Mother of the Word of God who was born from you, with the Bodiless Powers, Apostles, Prophets, High Priests and Martyrs, beseech him ever to give peace to the world, All-holy Virgin Mother.

****

Aposticha of Lauds, of Compunction.

Gather my scattered mind, Lord, and cleanse my hardened heart, granting me repentance as to Peter, groans as to the Publican, tears as to the Harlot, that with a loud voice I may cry to you: Save me, O God, as alone compassionate and lover of mankind.

Many times as I come to the end of singing hymns I am found to be full of sin, for though I utter songs with my tongue, with my soul I think on foul things; but set both to rights, Christ god, through repentance and save me.

****

Of the Martyrs.

The Soldiers of Christ rejected the fear of kings and tyrants and bravely and courageously they confessed him, the Lord and God and King of all, and they intercede for our souls.

Glory, Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Without seed you conceived of the Holy Spirit, and as we glorify you we cry out: Hail, All-holy Virgin!
