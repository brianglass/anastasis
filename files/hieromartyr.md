AT VESPERS
==========

**At** Lord, I have cried **Prosomia.**

Tone 1.

Blessed Martyr, inspired by God, with the dye of your own blood you have made bright your sacred and godly robe; you have advanced with true religion from power to power and from glory to glory; and now intercede that there may be given to our souls God’s peace and great mercy.

As a lawful priest you once offered to God the sacrifice without shedding of blood; but later as a true martyr, through shedding of blood you offered yourself, O inspired and all-honoured, as a whole burnt offering and an acceptable sacrifice to Christ: implore him for those who sing your praise.

Armies of martyrs you offered to Christ by your counsels and exhortations, glorious Martyr inspired by God, urging and teaching and providing your own self as an example; with them intercede that there may be given to our souls his peace and great mercy.

****

Theotokion.

Hemmed in on every side by dangers, whither shall I, miserable and wretched, flee, O Lady? Unless I flee to you, pure Virgin, as my only help, hope of the hopeless, bride of God; and do not despise me, your unworthy servant, O ready help of the afflicted.

****

Or Cross-Theotokion.

‘A sword has passed through my heart’, said the Virgin, as she saw Christ hanging on the tree, ‘and it rends me, as Symeon foretold to me of old. But arise, O Immortal, and glorify your Mother and handmaid with yourself, I implore’.

AT MATINS
=========

**The Canon. Ode 1. Tone 8. Irmos. Let us sing.**

\[Let us sing to the Lord, who led his people in the Red Sea, for he alone has been greatly glorified.\]

****

Troparia.

Bringing a double plaited garland of true religion: of priesthood and of martyrdom, by Christ you are called blessed.

Your sacred minister has been offered to you, the Chief Shepherd, as an innocent and honoured sacrifice through lawless hands.

You dispelled the gatherings of the heretics with your devout boldness, O Hierarch, as you proclaimed the uncreated Trinity.

****

Theotokion.

Immaculate Mother of God, who, beyond nature, gave birth to the incarnate and eternal Word beyond Godhead, we sing your praise.

****

Ode 3. Irmos. You are the foundation.

\[You are the foundation, Lord, of those who have recourse to you; you are the light of those in darkness; and my spirit sings your praise.\]

****

Troparia.

Venerable Saint, you appeared first as sacred minister, sacrificing to the Redeemer and later offered as a sacrifice to him.

You became a most trusted shepherd and no hireling, pouring out your own blood for your God-loving flock.

Well did you shepherd your Master’s flock, High Priest; therefore you have made your dwelling in the place of green pasture.

****

Theotokion.

Give us help by your intercessions, O All-pure, driving off all the assaults of dire troubles.

****

The Irmos.

You are the foundation, Lord, of those who have recourse to you; you are the light of those in darkness; and my spirit sings your praise.

****

Kathisma. Tone 3. Your confession.

With godly blood you made the Church radiant with splendour as a champion, O Bishop and Martyr, and you destroyed error by courageously enduring torments; and you enlightened the hearts of all believers; therefore as we celebrate your memory with faith, O all-honoured, we glorify the Saviour.

****

Theotokion.

Enslaved to passions I have become wholly a stranger to your commandments, as I sin each day, miserable wretch that I am; but with a broken soul I cry to you: Now, Master, who alone are unsearchable, make me, the condemned, worthy of your compassion through her who gave you birth.

****

Or Cross-Theotokion.

The undefiled Ewe-lamb of the Word, the unsullied Virgin Mother, as she saw the One who had flowered from her without pangs hanged upon the Cross, lamenting as a mother cried aloud: Alas, my Child, how do you suffer willingly to deliver mankind from the dishonour of the passions?

****

Ode 4. Irmos. I have heard, Lord.

\[Lord, I have heard the mystery of your dispensation; I have considered your works and glorified your Godhead.\]

****

Troparia.

Perfecting your lambs by your word, blessed Saint, you put to death the packs of the wolves with your body, while you placed your spirit in the hands of God.

Your sacrifice was sweet-smelling, all-pure and acceptable to the Redeemer; you both offered it with a mind inspired and were offered by lawless hands.

Anointed once, blest Saint, with priestly anointing, you were perfected too a second time by your martyr’s blood.

****

Theotokion.

Mother of God, field untilled, who blossomed with the life-giving ear, which grants life to the world, save those who sing your praise.

****

Ode 5. Irmos. Rising at dawn.

\[Rising at dawn, Lord, we cry out to you, ‘Save us! For you are our God, we know no other but you’.\]

****

Troparia.

You offered sacrifice without shedding of blood to the Master, while you brought yourself as fruit through blood, glorious Martyr.

You godlike tongue let fall drops of salvation; the stream of your blood spiritual joy.

The grace of your words strengthened the Church, and set you, blest Saint, as a pillar of orthodoxy.

****

Theotokion.

The ranks of angels and the companies of mortals worship your Offspring, immaculate Mother of God.

****

Ode 6. Irmos. Grant me a tunic.

\[Grant me a tunic of light, Most Merciful, Christ our God, who wrap yourself in light as in a garment.\]

****

Troparia.

Just as you had been baptised, you baptised peoples in water; while you were baptised a second time with your own blood.

Do not cease to make your entreaties to Christ, blest Saint, on behalf of your flock, and to offer your blood as supplication.

As a chosen and precious shoot of the vine of life, you flowered with much fruit for your Master, most sacred Martyr.

****

Theotokion

As God your Offspring was the destroyer of wooden idols, Mary, Bride of God, and he is worshipped with the Father and the Spirit.

****

The Irmos.

Grant me a tunic of light, Most Merciful, Christ our God, who wrap yourself in light as in a garment.

****

Ode 7. Irmos. The Youths from Judea.

\[The Youths from Judea of old in Babylon having come to the faith of the Trinity, trampled down the flame of the furnace as they sang, ‘God of our Fathers, blessed are you!’\]

****

Troparia.

Your sacrifice appeared as fair and rich, revered Father, for you were offered to the Master through blood, as one who offered without blood: God of our Fathers, blessed are you.

Shepherded and shepherding, you gathered happiness from both, Father; and you kept it safe by guarding the seal of your contest, as you sang: God of our Fathers, blessed are you.

In the Church of believers you taught the doctrine of the nature in three persons; and arraigned before unjust tribunals for it, O God-bearer, you sang: God of our Fathers, blessed are you.

****

Theotokion.

You grew as the most blest rod from the root of Jesse, O Virgin, flowering with a saving fruit for those who with faith cry out to your Son: God of our Fathers, blessed are you.

****

Ode 8. Irmos. The King of heaven.

\[The King of heaven, whom the hosts of Angels praise, praise and highly exalt to all the ages.\]

****

Troparia.

Be glad, believers, at the memory of the far-famed Priest and Martyr, as you cry aloud and highly exalt him to all the ages.

As we see the Hierarch, fittingly adorned with the crown of martyrdom, we highly exalt you, O Christ, to all the ages.

Fittingly the Master apportioned to you, Priest and Martyr, the gift and grace of wonders to all the ages.

****

Theotokion.

Beyond nature, O Virgin, you gave birth to the Creator, Saviour, God and Word, whom we highly exalt to all the ages.

****

The Irmos

The King of heaven, whom the hosts of Angels praise, praise and highly exalt to all the ages.

****

Ode 9. Irmos. The Offspring.

\[The Offspring of the Ever-Virgin, who was revealed before on the mountain to the Lawgiver in fire and bush for the salvation of us faithful, in never silent hymns let us magnify.\]

****

Troparia.

You were revealed as a faithful shepherd to your sheep, while you were offered to the Shepherd as a sheep in sacrifice, and you obtained a double glory, therefore we honour you, All-blessed.

As we guard your traditions, Father, and honour your struggle, the Trinity in one nature of the Godhead in songs we ceaselessly magnify.

You made your behaviour fair through self-mastery, All-blessed, with the colours of true religion; you showed your soul to be truly according to God’s image, blessed Father.

****

Theotokion.

You, Mother of God, are rampart and weapons for us who have recourse to you, and we urge you now to intercession, that we may be rescued from our foes.

****

The Irmos.

The Offspring of the Ever-Virgin, who was revealed before on the mountain to the Lawgiver in fire and bush for the salvation of us faithful, in never silent hymns let us magnify.

****

At the Liturgy, see the Apostle and Gospel and Communion for the 26th of October.
