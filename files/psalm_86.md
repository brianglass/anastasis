PSALM 86
========

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">For the sons of KorÃ©. A Psalm. A Song.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; color: red; font-style: normal">Argument</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:red;
font-style:normal"></span>

Once again the sons of KorÃ© sing this psalm of the Church. Through it they proclaim the call of the nations and the illumination that came to the Church of the Only-begotten through the dispensation that accompanied the incarnation.

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">Its foundations are on the holy mountains</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. That is of the people called through faith. It says, moreover, that a people from the nations has been built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[1]</span></a>.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">The Lord loves the gates of Sion more than all the tabernacles of Jacob</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. Â‘Gates of SionÂ’ means the introductory and elementary teaching of the Church; while Â‘tabernacles of JacobÂ’ refers to the worship<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[2]</span></a> in accordance with the Law. It means, then, that the polity<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[3]</span></a> of the Gospel has been judged by God to be preferable to the worship according to the Law.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">Glorious things have been said of you, City of God</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. What glorious things have been of it, other than that the Only-begotten dwelt in it, in accordance with the words, Â‘Here I shall dwell, for I have chosen itÂ’<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[4]</span></a>.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">I will remember Raab and Babylon</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. I will remember for their good those who turn back to me, even those who have fallen into appalling licentiousness and extreme idolatry. For that is what Raab and Babylon mean for us.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">See, foreigners and Tyre and people of the Ethiopians</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. This expression clearly teaches us that the Church is made up from all the nations.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">Sion is Mother, a man will say; and a man has been born in her</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">.<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[5]</span></a> It is clear that it says Â‘MotherÂ’ because we who have believed will choose<a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[6]</span></a> Sion, that is the Church, as Mother, in which there is the man, or rather the One who himself founded it. This is he who became man for our sake and who promised to found the Church on the rock.<a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[7]</span></a></span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">The Lord will recount in the list of peoples and rulers</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. It means that the Lord will recount the list<a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[8]</span></a> of the peoples and rulers that are in the Church itself. And what else does this mean but the list that is made in heaven, which he himself recounted to them when he said, Â‘Rejoice because your names have been inscribed<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[9]</span></a> in heavenÂ’<a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[10]</span></a>?</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">Dwelling in you is like that of all who rejoice</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. It means that when the dwelling of those in the Church is in you, then they will also be full of joy.</span>

If it had not become debased, one could have used the word Â‘cultÂ’.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref3" id="_ftn3"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[3]</span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The Greek is Â‘***politeia***Â’, which means the whole way of life. The lives of the Saints are commonly entitled, Â‘***Bios kai Politeia***Â’.</span>

It probably arises from a scribal mistake in Greek, by which Â‘***meter Sion***Â’ was read instead of Â‘***me te Sion***Â’, meaning Â‘Shall (one) not (say) to SionÂ’, which is a reasonable rendering of the Hebrew. This is the reading of some Greek manuscripts. The reading with Â‘motherÂ’, however, goes back to the early days of the Church, and is found in Latin as early as Tertullian. It is the text that the Church has accepted liturgically and theologically.</span>

The word Â‘***epigraphein***Â’ is used in the classical language in Athens to mean Â‘to choose someone as, say, patron and enter, or inscribe \[Greek Â‘***graphein***Â’\] their name as such on the public registerÂ’. This seems to be the meaning here. The idea is picked up by St Athanasios in his comments on the following verse.</span>
