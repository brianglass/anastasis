Lawless Jews, where are the seals, and the money you gave the soldiers?
The treasure was not stolen, but he has risen, as a mighty one; you have
been put to shame, you who denied Christ, the Lord of glory, who
suffered and was buried and rose from the dead; let us worship him.\
While the sealed was sealed, how were you robbed, O Jews? You set guards

life for the world from his side? Why do you seek the Immortal as a
mortal in a grave? Rather run and tell his Disciples the universal joy
