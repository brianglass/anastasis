INTRODUCTORY NOTE

The Office I have translated here is that written by the late Father Gerasimos and first published in 1952 in connection with the decision by the Church of Greece to move the day of the feast to the 28th of the month, to commemorate the famous ‘No‘ of the Greeks to the Italians in 1941. Father Gerasimos‘s text is centred on the original story of the vision of the monk Andrew in the church at Vlachernae and not in the least nationalistic. It is interesting, however, to note that in the text of the October Menaion published by the *Apostoliki Diakonia* in Athens altered the third line of the verses of the Synaxarion reads,

Protection of God’s Mother now veils Greece,

where Fr Gerasimos had written,

Protection of God’s Mother veils God’s people.

OCTOBER
-------

We celebrate the commemoration of the Holy Protecting Veil of our Most Holy Lady, the Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary. \[In Greece this feast is celebrated on 28 October.\]

AT GREAT VESPERS
----------------

**After the Opening Psalm,** Blessed is the man \[**1st Kathisma, 1st Section**\]**, we insert 6 \[8 at a Vigil\] Stichera, and sing the following Prosomia.**

Tone 1. O marvellous wonder!

O marvellous wonder! The pure Mother of God each day unfolds her Protecting Veil, and with her motherly care and grace manifestly protects from every assault those who look to her and cry: Hail, Full of grace, protection and help of the your race that faithfully magnifies you, O Virgin.

Ah, your wonders, Pure Virgin! For you marvellously unfolded your Protecting Veil and wondrously protected the Queen of cities; while later by the grace of your light-bearing Protection you openly saved the people that bears Christ’s name from hostile threat. Therefore, raising songs of grateful praise, rejoicing we commemorate your many wonders.

The choirs of believers, Sovereign Lady, proclaim your providence towards us, as we praise your mother’s care. For from of old in your compassion you placed us beneath your Protection, and declared the race of the Orthodox to be your chosen lot. Therefore, O Full of grace, we cry to you: Hail! and magnify the graces of your godly Protecting Veil.

****

Other Prosomia. Tone 4. As noblest of Martyrs.

As we celebrate the memorial of your Protecting Veil, O Immaculate, we magnify your loving-kindness; because you rescue your race from every constraint and grant each day unstinted grace to those who praise the astounding mighty works of your glory and the greatness of its wonders.

Wondrously of old you invisibly unfolded your Protecting Veil and protected the Royal City, but now even more manifestly you protect us, immaculate Maiden, and you guard and keep safe from all affliction your new inheritance. Therefore we sing the praise of the gifts of your Protecting Veil, O Virgin, and your constant help.

In many ways, O Maiden, we know and clearly we have seen the manifestation of your holy Protection, shining out for by proofs and wonders, and with fervent tears we have glorified your abundant goodness, because you save us in dangers and grant joy to the afflicted and the suffering.

Glory. Both now. **Tone 6.**

Today your faithful people, Mother of God, whom you declared to be a holy nation and a special inheritance, honours the grace of your Protecting Veil, as they sing your songs of thanksgiving. For you have worked wonders and marvels among us in past generations, but now also you protect us and give us strength, you have rescued us from foes who assail us and have filled our souls with joy. Therefore we confess your grace and taking refuge in your radiant Protection, we fervently cry out, ‘Until the end of the age, Queen of all, protect those who unhesitatingly call out to you.

Entrance,

O Joyful Light**, the Prokeimenon of the day and the readings.**

The Reading is from Numbers.
\[**9:15-23\]**

On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the house of the testimony. And at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning. So it was continually. The cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. And whenever the cloud went up from the tent, after that the people of Israel set out. And in the place where the cloud stopped, there the people of Israel encamped. At the command of the Lord the people of Israel encamped, and at the command of the Lord they set out. ‘For as many days as the cloud overshadows the tabernacle, the children of Israel will remain in camp. Even when the cloud has continued over the tabernacle many days, the children of Israel will keep the charge of the Lord, and they are not to set out. And it shall that whenever the cloud covers the tabernacle for a number of days, in accordance with the word of the Lord they will remain in camp, and in accordance with the command of the Lord they will set out. And it shall be that whenever the cloud remains from evening until morning; and that the cloud goes up in the morning, they will set out by day or by night. When the cloud overshadows it for a month, or longer, the children of Israel shall remain in camp and not set out. Because they will set out at the command of the Lord’. They kept the charge of the Lord, at the command of the Lord by Moses.

The Reading is from Exodus.
\[**40:15-32\]**

And it came to pass in the first month in the second year since the children of Israel had set out from Egypt, at the new moon the tabernacle was erected. And Moses erected the tabernacle; he laid its capitals, put in its bars, and raised up its pillars. And he spread the curtains over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tabernacle over it, as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he took the testimonies and put them into the ark, and put the poles under the ark, and put the covering of the veil on it and covered the ark of testimony, as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he put the table in the tabernacle of testimony, on the north side, outside the veil of the tabernacle. And he set the bread of the on it before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he put the lampstand in the tabernacle of testimony, on the south side of the tabernacle, and set up its lamps before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he put the golden altar in the tabernacle of testimony before the veil, and on it he burnt incense that had been compounded; as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle. And he set the court round the tabernacle of testimony. So Moses finished the whole work. Then the cloud covered the tabernacle of testimony, and the tabernacle was filled with the glory of the Lord. And Moses was not able to enter the tabernacle of testimony because the cloud overshadowed it, and the tabernacle was filled with the glory of the Lord. Whenever the cloud went up from the tabernacle, the children of Israel would move off with their baggage. but if the cloud did not go up, then they did not move off until the day that the cloud did go up. For the cloud was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all Israel at every stage of their journey.

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Ezekiel.
\[**43:27-44:4\]**

It shall be from the eighth day and upwards, the Priests shall make your holocausts upon the altar, and those for your salvation; and I shall accept you, says the Lord. And he turned me back by the way of the outer gate of the Holy Place, which looks towards the east, and it was shut. And the Lord said to me: This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no one shall pass through it, because the Lord, the God of Israel, will enter through it, and it shall be shut. Therefore this prince shall sit in it to eat bread. By the way of the Elam of the gate he shall enter, and by that way he shall go out. And he brought me by the way of the gate towards the North, opposite the House; and I saw, and behold the whole house of the Lord was full of glory.

Verses

Those who with faith, pure Virgin, look to you
With your Protection you protect and cherish.
Protection of God’s Mother veils God’s people.

Once, during an all-night vigil that was being celebrated in the holy shrine in Vlachernae, the blessed Andrew went there, as was his custom. Epiphanios was there also with one of his children. He was would stand there, as his custom was, because his fervour gave him strength, sometimes until midnight, sometimes until dawn. And so, when it was already about eleven o’clock at night, the blessed Andrew saw with his own eyes a most extraordinary vision coming in female form from the royal doors with a dread entourage, among which was the honoured Forerunner and the son thunder, holding her by the hand on either side, and many Saints, robed in white, went before her; while others followed with hymns and spiritual songs. When she drew near the ambo, Andrew approached Epiphanios and said, ‘Do you see the Lady and Mistress of the world?’ He replied, ‘Yes, my spiritual father.’

And as they watched, she bowed her knees and prayed for a long time, shedding tears down her godlike and immaculate face. After her prayer, she advanced to the sanctuary, where she entreated for the people present. So when she had removed the veil which she was wearing on her most-pure head and which had the appearance of lightning, she unrolled it and taking it with great reverence in her all-pure hands — it was large and awesome — spread it out above all the people who were standing there. The saints saw it stretched out over the people for a number of hours and blazing with the gory of the Lord like amber. As long as the most holy Mother of God was there, it was visible also, but after she had departed, it was no longer to be seen. For while she indeed took it with, she felt behind her grace for those who were there.

At the prayers of your most pure Mother, Christ God, have mercy and protect us from visible and invisible enemies and save our souls. Amen.

****

First Canon.
Ode 7. Irmos.

The godlike Children did not worship creation instead of the Creator, but bravely trampling on the threat of fire, rejoicing they sang: O highly exalted Lord and God of our fathers, blessed are you! **Twice.**

****

Troparia

You have placed us, Sovereign Lady, under your Protecting Veil, and you ever protect us from dread abuse, assault of foes and every affliction. Therefore with upraised voices we all sing your praise to the ages.

You protected the royal city of Constantine as your chosen part, Pure Virgin; likewise you now protect with your glory, All-blameless Lady, us who take refuge in your fervent defence.

The wondrous overshadowing of our race with your godlike Protection, Pure Virgin, clearly manifests your providence, through which you grant joy and peace to our souls.

Unhusbanded, O All-pure, you husbanded Christ, the Husbandman of our life; as cause of our joy you appeared to those who sang, Hail, Sovereign Lady of our race, saviour and sweet help.

****

Second Canon. God’s condescension.

The living house in which God Most High made his dwelling, the Pure Mother of God, was seen of old in her house and unfolding her Veil she wondrously protected those who had put their trust in her.

We are wholly unable to comprehend the greatness of your goodness towards us, O Maiden; for as a truly loving mother you protect, cherish and nourish us each day. And so we sing the praise of your godly Protection.

God-bearing Andrew in an immaterial vision saw you in mind spiritually unfolding your radiant Protection for your suppliants, and he praised you marvellous works, that are beyond reason and understanding.

Of old a cloud of light covered the tent of witness; while now your wondrous and most radiant Protection, immaculate Maiden, covers the Church of Christ day and night as the mountain of God.

In many ways you revealed of old the force of your Protection, Mother of God, by signs and wonders and countless deeds of power, acting as our Champion every day, O All-pure; while now we sing the praise of your saving wondrous works.

Your chosen people, O All-blameless, faithfully receiving force and strength from your godly Protection, ever escapes from afflictions that attack them and from warlike foes, and remains unharmed by any madness, Mother of God, through your solicitude.

From on high, Immaculate Virgin, unfold your holy and most radiant Protection, and as of old protect us and keep us safe from foes who attack us, and deliver your inheritance from their wickedness and assault.

Venerable Andrew and venerable and godly Epiphanios saw you unfolding the Protecting Veil that had protected your immaculate body, Mother of God Ever-Virgin, and they were amazed; for you protected all, O Maiden, with immaterial light and heavenly glory.

****

Second Canon. The One who was glorified.

To those who walk in the night of life, Pure Virgin, your all-holy Protection grants divine force, light and salvation and directs them all to the repose of eternal life.

The choirs of the Bodiless Powers and of the Saints, seeing you, Pure Virgin, in your holy church unfolding your sacred veil and protecting the world, praised the fount of your mercy.

Protection of the world, wider than a cloud, are you, pure Mother of God, salvation of mortals; and so, as we celebrate with love the commemoration of your honoured Protection, we praise the multitudes of your wonders.

Having gained you, pure Virgin, as a mighty defence in life and unbreakable hope, we take refuge under your mighty Protection, and we are rescued from the stumbling-blocks of the Trickster as we sing the praise of your grace.

Angels, seeing the Protecting Veil of the Mother of God were amazed at how it protects and saves those who trust in it.

The dew which falls in drops from your Godly Protection as from an immaterial cloud, O Immaculate, becomes healing for us and brings to an end sicknesses of soul and body for those who cry: Hail, Ever-Virgin, our joy and consolation!

Angels and mortals honour your revered Protection, Sovereign Lady, for by it you protect all those who faithfully sing your praise.

The Church of the faithful celebrates a sacred memorial of your wonders to your glory and praise, O All-blameless, and with faith taking refuge under your Protection, cries out to you: Protect and guard me until my life’s end, O All-praised.

With all our soul let us gather to your godly Protection, immaculate Lady, bringing thankful praise with fervent gratitude, for you have chosen us for your own and you treat us kindly in all things; you guide us and save us from afflictions.

Immaculate Virgin who bore God, save your flock, protecting it with your Protecting Veil and caring for it in every way.

Magnify, O my soul, the all-holy Protection of the pure Virgin.

Bending with motherly love, O Maiden, towards your people who fervently hope in you, for you are compassionate, in a strange manner you spiritually unfolded for them your godly Protection like a cloud of light.

Glory.

Magnify, O my soul, the Godhead without beginning in three Persons.

Raising your hands to God you implore on our behalf the One who came forth from you, and thence, unfolding spiritually your light-bearing Protection, you protected all the faithful. And so, as we celebrate its yearly memorial, Mother of God, we magnify you.

Both now.

Magnify, O my soul, the wonderful mighty deeds of the All-immaculate Maiden.

The Ever-Virgin Maiden and pure Mother of God, ally and Protection of the attacked, and above all refuge and ready help, let us all praise as is fitting, as we magnify her Protection.

Your all-holy and dazzling Protection, which you unfold each day like a cloud of light, and with which you manifestly protect and cover us, in good fortune and in disasters, as we have learned, O Virgin, with gladness we call blessed.

Of old the queen of cities, O Virgin, escaped from dangers and fearful wars by your divine and wondrous Protection, while today your people by its grace escapes from troubles, disasters and calamities.

How wondrous the grace of your kindness, O Virgin, for your people both of old and now. And so, as we take refuge each day under your revered Protection, we find deliverance from every assault and participation in blessings of every kind.

Glory. Both now. Tone 5.

The gifts of your Protecting Veil, O Mother of God, unfolded in every place like the beams of the sun, bring us graces in countless ways; for they drive out the gloom of diseases, rout the regiments of foes, dispel the fog of unlooked for disasters and grant us lasting peace. But, O Virgin Full of grace, accept our thankful hymns, we beg, and be for us an ally and defender until the ends of the age.

Apostle.

The Reading is from the Epistle of Paul to the Hebrews.

\[

**9:1-7**\]

Brethren, now the first tabernacle had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary. For a tabernacle was constructed, the first one, in which were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the Presence; this is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was a tabernacle called the Holy of Holies. In it stood the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which there were a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; above it were the Cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot speak now in detail. Such preparations having been made, the priests go continually into the first tabernacle to carry out their ritual duties; but only the high priest goes into the second, and he but once a year, and not without taking the blood that he offers for himself and for the sins committed in ignorance by the people.
