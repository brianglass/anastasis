INTRODUCTORY NOTE
-----------------

This translation of the office for 5 August only contains the texts for the Forefeast. I have added a number of footnotes containing the references to biblical passages alluded to in the texts.

One curious feature of Matins is the presence of a Triode. One would  rather have expected one at Compline. The Irmi of the main Canon are those of the Mother of God.
