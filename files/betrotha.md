SERVICE OF BETROTHAL
--------------------

**After the divine Liturgy, with the Priest standing in the Sanctuary, those who are to be joined take their stand before the Holy Doors, with the man on the right and the woman on the left. On the right side of the Holy Table are placed their two rings, one of gold and the other of silver. The silver one towards the right and the gold towards the left, close to each other. The Priest, having come into the narthex, signs the heads of those who are to be married three times and gives them lighted candles. He leads them into the Church and censes in the form of a cross.**

\[

**The Priest questions them and asks the bride if she wishes to marry the groom, and likewise if the groom wishes to marry the bride.**\] ****

Then, if there is a Deacon, he says:

Master, give the blessing. ****

Priest, aloud:

Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Deacon:

In peace, let us pray to the Lord. ****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy. **And so after each petition.**

Deacon:

For the peace from on high and for the salvation of our souls, let us pray to the Lord.

For the peace of the whole world, for the welfare of the holy Churches of God, and for the union of all, let us pray to the Lord.

For this holy house, and for those who enter it with faith, reverence and the fear of God, let us pray to the Lord.

For our Archbishop

**N.**, for the honoured order of presbyters, for the diaconate in Christ, for all the clergy and the people, let us pray to the Lord.

For the servant of God

**N.** and the servant of God **M**., who are now being betrothed to one another, and for their salvation, let us pray to the Lord.

That they may be granted children for the continuation of the race and all their requests that are for their salvation, let us pray to the Lord.

That there may sent down to them perfect and peaceful love and help, let us pray to the Lord.

That they may be kept in concord and sure faith, let us pray to the Lord.

That they may be blessed with concord and sure faith, let us pray to the Lord.

That they may be preserved with a blameless manner and way of life, let us pray to the Lord.

That the Lord, our God, may grant them honourable marriage and a bed without defilement, let us pray to the Lord.

For our deliverance from all affliction, wrath, danger and constraint, let us pray to the Lord.

Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by your grace.

Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most blessed and glorious Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, with all the Saints, let us entrust ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God.

****

Singers:

To you, O Lord. ****

Priest (aloud):

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy. ****

The Priest says the following Prayer out loud:

Eternal God, who brought into unity what had been separated and establish an unbreakable bond of agreement; who blessed Isaac and Rebecca, and declared them to be the heirs of your promise; bless these servants of yours also, guiding them in every good work.

Because you, O God, are merciful and love mankind, and to you we give glory, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Priest:

Peace to all. ****

Singers:

And to your spirit. ****

Deacon:

Bow your heads to the Lord. ****

Singers:

To you, O Lord. ****

The Priest prays:

Lord, our God, who once betrothed yourself to the Church from the nations as a pure virgin, bless this betrothal, and unite and preserve these servants of yours in peace and concord.

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Then the Priest, having taken the rings on the dish, gives first to the man the gold one and says three times, as he makes the sign of the Cross with the ring on his forehead:

The servant of God

**N.** betroths himself to the servant of God **M.**, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. ****

Then, having taken the silver ring, he does the same to the woman, saying:

The servant of God

**N.** betroths herself to the servant of God **M.**, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. ****

And when he has spoken three times to each of them he makes the sign of the Cross with the ring on their foreheads and places the rings on their right fingers.

Then the Best Man changes the rings.

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

Singers:

Lord, have mercy. ****

The Priest says this Prayer:

Lord our God, you journeyed with the servant of the Patriarch Abraham in Mesopotamia when he was sent to obtain a wife for his lord Isaac, and by means of drawing water you revealed that he should betroth Rebecca. Bless the betrothal of your servants

**N**. and **M**. and make firm the word that they have spoken. Confirm them with the holy unity that comes from you. For it was you who in the beginning created male and female, and it is by you that woman is linked to man as a helper and for the continuation of the human race. Therefore, Lord our God, who sent truth out to your inheritance and your promise to your servants, our fathers, your elect in every generation, look on your servant **N**. and your servant **M**., and make firm their betrothal in faith and concord and truth and love. For it is you, Lord, who declared that times a pledge is to be given and made firm in everything. By a ring authority was given to Joseph in Egypt. By a ring Daniel was glorified in the country of Babylon. By a ring the truth of Thamar was revealed. By a ring our heavenly Father showed compassion to the prodigal son. For he said, ‘Put a ring on his hand and bring out and slay the fatted calf, and let us eat and be joyful’. It was your right hand, Lord, that armed Moses at the Red Sea, for through your true word the heavens were made firm and the earth set on its foundations. And the right hand of your servants will be blessed by your mighty word and by your upraised arm. Therefore, Master, with your heavenly blessing now bless also this putting-on of rings. And may an Angel of the Lord go before them all the days of their lives. For you are the One who blesses and sanctifies all things, and to you we give glory, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Singers:

Amen. ****

Then Litany and Dismissal.
