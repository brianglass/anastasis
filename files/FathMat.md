**After the 1st Psalter Reading, Kathismata. Tone 6.**

When the tomb had been opened and Hell was lamenting, Mary cried out to
the hidden Apostles: Come out, workers of the vineyard, proclaim the
word of the Resurrection: the Lord has risen, granting the world his
great mercy.

Glory.

Mary Magdalen stood at your tomb, O Lord, and wept as she cried out, and
thinking you to be the gardener she said: Where have you laid eternal
life? Where hidden the One who sits on the throne of the Cherubim? For
those who were guarding him are dead from fear: either give me my Lord,
or cry with me: You who were among the dead and raised the dead, glory
to you\!

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

You, who called your Mother blessed, came to your Passion by your
voluntary purpose; wishing to seek out Adam, you shone on the Cross,
saying to the Angels: Rejoice with me, for the lost drachma has been
found. You who wisely dispose all things, glory to you\!

****

After the 2nd Psalter Reading, Kathismata.

Life lay in the grave, and a seal lay on the stone; soldiers were
guarding Christ like a sleeping king; and having struck his foes with
blindness the Lord arose.

Glory.

By your voluntary death we have found immortal life, O all-powerful and
only Saviour of all things: for by your holy Rising you have called all
back, you who abolished Hell’s victory and the sting of death.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Virgin Mother of God implore your Son, Christ our God, who was nailed
willingly on a Cross and who rose from the dead, that our souls may be

Antiphon 2.

If the Lord had not been with us, none of us could have resisted the

Against Arius.  

The Son the Father’s Essence does not share,  
Said Arius: may he not share God’s glory.

We celebrate the present feast for the following reason. Since our Lord
Jesus Christ, who had put on our flesh, had ineffably accomplished the
whole dispensation and be reinstated on his Father’s throne, the Saints,
wishing to show that the Son of God had truly become man and that as
perfect man God had been assumed and had sat down at the right of the
Majesty on high and because this synod of the holy Fathers had thus
proclaimed and confessed him to be consubstantial and identical in
honour with the Father; for this reason they appointed this present
Feast after the glorious Assumption, as it were putting forward the
assembly of so many Fathers proclaiming this, that the one who was taken
up in the flesh was God and in the flesh perfect man.

This Synod took place under Konstantine the Great in the twentieth year
of his reign. For when the persecution ceased he ruled first in Rome,
but afterwards he also founded this all-blessed city, named after
himself, in the five thousand eight hundred and thirty eighth year from
the foundation of the world. Then too began the business of Arius. His
came originally from Libya. After coming to Alexandria he was ordained
deacon by Peter the Martyr Bishop of Alexandria. Then he began to utter
blasphemies against the Son of God, declaring that he had coming into
being from non-existence and was far from the divine dignity and that it
was only by analogy that he was called Wisdom and Word of God, as though
he were setting himself against the impious Sabellios, who said that in
the God head there was only one person and one hypostasis, and that
there was at one moment the Father, then the Son and then the holy
Spirit. When Arius uttered these blasphemies, the great Peter refused
him the priesthood, after having seen Christ like an infant on the altar
wrapped in a torn cloak and saying that Arius torn it. But Achillas, who
became bishop of Alexandria after Peter, licensed Arius again under
promises. In addition he ordained him presbyter and put him in charge of
the school of Alexandria. On the death of Achillas, Alexander became
bishop. He, on finding Arius again uttering the same, and worse,
blasphemies, expelled him from the Church, condemning him through a
synod. As Theodoretos says, Arius was the first to belch out that Christ
was of a mutable nature and that the Lord had assumed flesh without mind
or soul. Arius however led many away by his impiety, he writes, and he
won over Eusebios of Nikomedia, Paulinos of Tyre, Eusebios of Caesarea
and others and he moved against Alexander. But Alexander by sending his
blasphemies and his deposition throughout the inhabited world and roused
many to his own defence.

Because the Church was much troubled and there appeared no cure for the
love of strife concerning doctrine, Konstantine the Great gathered the
Fathers from all over the inhabited world by public transport to the
city of Nikea. He was also present there. And when the Fathers had taken
their seats, he being invited took his seat, not on a royal throne but
on a seat far beneath his rank. When they had spoken against Arius, he
and all those who agreed with him was put under anathema. While the Word
of God was proclaimed to be consubstantial, identical in honour and
without beginning with the Father. They also issued the holy Symbol of
the faith, taking it as far as *and in the holy Spirit*; for the rest
was completed by the second Synod. In addition the first Synod also
fixed the feast of Pascha, when and how we are to celebrate it, and not
with the Jews, as had previously been the custom. They laid down twenty
canons concerning the constitution of the Church. Finally Konstantine
the Great, Equal of the Apostles, confirmed the holy Symbol of the faith
in scarlet letters.

Of these holy Fathers, two hundred and thirty two were Bishops, eighty
six Priests, Deacons and Monks; those present numbering three hundred
and eighteen. The most outstanding were Silvester, Bishop of Rome and
Metrophanes of Constantinople who was sick. They were represented by
legates. Alexander of Alexandria with Athanasios the Great, who was
archdeacon at the time, Efstathios of Antioch and Makarios of Jerusalem,
Hosios, bishop of Cordoba, Paphnutios the confessor, Nicholas myrovlitis
and Spyridon of Trimytheus, who having refuted a philosopher who was
present by demonstrating the triple sun, baptized him. In the course of
the Synod two bishops among the Fathers passed over to God, and
Konstantine the Great placed the definition of the Synod in their
coffins and shut them securely. He found the definition had also been
confirmed by them and signed with ineffable words of God.

When the Synod was over, since the newly founded City had already been
finished, Konstantine the Great invited over all those holy men. When
they had all assembled and prayed they decreed that it was the Queen of
cities and dedicated it to the Mother of the Word on the orders of the
Emperor. And each of the Saints made his way home.

But before Konstantine the Great passed over to God, he divided the rule
with his son Konstantios. Arius came to the Emperor, saying he had given
up everything and was united with the Church of God. So having written
down his blasphemies he hung them round his neck, and as though obedient
to the Synod he struck them off with his hand and said he obeyed them.
The Emperor was indifferent and ordered the Patriarch of Constantinople
to receive Arius into communion. The Patriarch at the time was
Alexander, successor of Metrophanes, who, knowing the duplicity of the
man, was hesitant and besought God to reveal to him if in his opinion he
should communicate with Arius. hen the moment arrived for him to
concelebrate with Arius, his prayer became more fervent. But Arius, as
he was on his way to the church, was overcome by violent stomach pains
near the column in the forum and entered a public lavatory. There he was
rent apart and disgorged all his inside from below, undergoing the
disembowelling of Judas for an equal betrayal of the Word, and having
torn away the Son of God from the Father’s essence, he was torn apart
and found dead. And so the Church of God was delivered from his
mischief.

Through the prayers of the three hundred and eighteen god-bearing
Fathers, O Christ God, have mercy upon us. Amen.

Ode 9. Irmos.

‘It is impossible for humans to see God, on whom the ranks of Angels
dare not gaze; but through you, All-pure one, the Word incarnate has
appeared to mortals. As we magnify him with all the heavenly hosts, we
call you blessed.’

****

Troparia.

You remained without a share in passions, O Word of God, though in the
flesh conversant with the passions; but you loose humanity from the
passions, to passions being yourself a passion, O our Saviour; for you
alone are impassible and all-powerful.

Having accepted the corruption of death, you kept your body from tasting
destruction; while our life-giving and divine soul, Master, was not
abandoned in Hell; but rising as from sleep, you raised us up with
yourself.

With pure lips all we mortals glorify God the Father, the Son like him

Of the Assumption. As Mother of God.

As they watched you, the redeemer of the world, Christ God, being
divinely exalted, the Apostles leapt for joy and magnified you with awe.

As the Angels saw your flesh now made divine, O Christ, in the height,
they signalled to one another: Truly this is our God.

As the ranks of bodiless powers, Christ God, saw you being raised on
clouds, they cried: For the King of glory lift up the gates.

‘Hail, Queen, glorious virgin mother;

But every mind is dizzy when it seeks to understand  
Your giving birth; therefore with one accord we glorify you.’

Resurrection Exapostilarion.

The sea of Tiberias of old held Nathanael with the sons of Zebedee,
Peter and, with two others, Thomas, to fishing. At Christ’s command they
lowered the net on the right hand side and caught a multitude of fish.
Recognising him, Peter hastened to him. Appearing to them for the third
time, he showed them bread, and fish lying on coals.

****

Another, of the Fathers.

As we celebrate to-day the memory of the godlike Fathers, we ask, O
All-merciful, by their intercessions: Deliver your people, Lord, from
every harm of heresies, and make us worthy to glorify Father, Word and
the All-holy Spirit.

Another, of the Assumption. Model Melody. Tone 2.

With your Disciples watching you, O Christ, you were taken up to the
Father to take your seat with him. Angels ran forward crying out: Lift
up the gates, lift up, for the King has gone up to the glory, source of
light.

At Lauds we insert 8 Stichera, and we sing 4 of the Resurrection and 4
of the Holy Fathers.

Of the Resurrection. Tone 6.

Your cross, O Lord, is life and resurrection for your people, and
trusting in it we sing your praise, our risen God: Have mercy upon us.

Your burial, O Master, opened Paradise to the human race; and ransomed
from corruption we sing your praise, our risen God: Have mercy upon us.

With the Father and the Spirit let us sing the praise of Christ, risen
from the dead, and let us cry out to him: You are our life and our
resurrection: Have mercy upon us.

You rose from the grave on the third day, O Christ, as it was written,
raising our Forefather with you: therefore the human race glorifies you
and hymns your Resurrection.

****

Of the Fathers. Prosomia. Tone 6.

Welding together all the knowledge of the soul, and examining it
together by the divine Spirit, the revered Fathers, far-famed,
all-blessed and truly inspired by God, in words inspired traced out the
revered Creed, by which they taught that the Word is with the Begetter
without beginning, and most surely consubstantial, clearly following the
teachings of the Apostles.

Verse:

Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our Fathers.

Receiving all the spiritual brilliance of the Holy Spirit, as heralds of
Christ the blessed champions of the gospel doctrines and the devout
traditions inspired by God proclaimed the supernatural oracle, short in
words, but rich in meaning, having received on high the clear revelation
of them, and enlightened they set forth a definition taught by God.

******

Verse:

Assemble to him all his holy ones, who have made his covenant upon
sacrifices.

Gathering all their pastoral knowledge, stirring their most justified
rage, the godly Fathers, as Christ’s truest servants and most sacred
initiates of God’s message, have now driven off the fierce and ravening
wolves with the sling of the Spirit, slinging them from the assembly of
the Church, as ones who had fallen to death, and were incurably sick.

Glory.

**Tone 6.**

The choir of holy Fathers, hurrying together from the ends of the
inhabited world, taught the one essence and nature of Father, Son and
Holy Spirit, and clearly handed down to the Church the mystery of
theology. As we praise them with faith, let us call them blessed as we
say: O godly camp, inspired soldiers of the Lord’s array; stars with
many lights of the spiritual firmament; the indestructible towers of the
mystical Sion; the sweet-scented flowers of Paradise; the all-golden
mouths of the Word; Nicea’s boast; adornment of the inhabited world,
intercede unceasingly for our souls.

Both now.

You are most blessed, O Virgin Mother of God, for through him who took
flesh from you, Hell has been captured, Adam recalled, the curse slain,
Eve set free, death put to death, and we given life. Therefore in praise
we cry: Blessed are you, Christ our God, who have been thus
well-pleased, glory to you.

****

Great Doxology, and Dismissal.

Before the First Hour Eothinon 10. Tone 6.

After your descent into Hell and your Resurrection from the dead, O
Christ, the Disciples, losing heart as was natural at your separation
from them, turned back to their trade: and once again there were boats
and nets and a catch nowhere. But you appeared, O Saviour, and as Master
of all things ordered them to cast their nets on the right hand side:
and at once the word was deed, and there was a great multitude of fish,
and a strange supper ready on land. Your Disciples partook of it then;
make us also worthy to enjoy it now in spirit, O Lover of humankind.
