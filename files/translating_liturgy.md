## TRANSLATING LITURGY

This  is a revised version of a paper first read to the annual
conference of the Fellowship of SS. Alban and Sergius at Chester on 17
August 1995.

In the earlier version on this page I included Greek and Slavonic fonts
that I now discover are locked by their makers and cannot be embedded
into PDF files published on the Web. I hope the ones I have used now can
be so embedded.
