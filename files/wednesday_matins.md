We worship the tree of your Cross, lover of humankind, because you, the Life of all, were nailed upon it.

In the Orthodox Scriptures MosesÂ’ successor, who saved the people of Israel after MosesÂ’ death and led them in the conquest of the Promised Land, is called Â‘JesusÂ’, and because of his name he is frequently evoked typologically in the liturgical texts. The use of the Protestant pseudo-Hebrew word Â‘JoshuaÂ’ obscures this and it, and other Protestant pseudo-Hebraisms, should be shunned by the Orthodox.

The poet has the latter passage in mind.

<a href="#_ftnref25" id="_ftn25"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[25]</span></a> Â‘BeliarÂ’ is one of the frequent names used for the devil in the liturgical texts, yet it only occurs once in the Orthodox Bible, at 2 Cor. 6:15. In the OT the word Â‘belialÂ’, which in Hebrew means Â‘worthlessnessÂ’, Â‘good for nothingÂ’, occurs many times, but it is never taken to be a proper name in the lxx, which translates it by Â‘lawlessÂ’, Â‘pestilentÂ’ and other such words. The Vulgate and older English versions tended to treat the word as a proper name, but most modern versions do not so regard it. In later writings, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, the *Testament of Levi* and the *Ascension of Isaias*, it has become a name for the devil. In the latter we read (2:4), Â‘And Manasses turned away his own heart to serve Beliar Â—for the angel of lawlessness, who is the ruler of this world, is BeliarÂ’. The source of the usage of the liturgical texts is, therefore, almost certainly 2 Corinthians.

<a href="#_ftnref26" id="_ftn26"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[26]</span></a> This word, used here in the plural, means literally Â‘a nod or inclination of the headÂ’ and so Â‘assent or approvalÂ’. The Latin equivalent is *nutus*.

<a href="#_ftnref53" id="_ftn53"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[53]</span></a> The musical punctuation suggests that the adverb could modify Â‘sufferÂ’. The grammar allows either. The many similar texts in the service books support the translation above.

<a href="#_ftnref54" id="_ftn54"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[54]</span></a> Matt. 13:22, Mark 4:19, Luke 8:14. The only uses of this word in the Bible are these three in the parable of the sower.

<a href="#_ftnref55" id="_ftn55"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[55]</span></a> This troparion plays on the words <span style="font-family:&quot;Symbol Accentuated&quot;">lÃ³goV, </span>Â’wordÂ’, but also Â‘reasonÂ’ and <span style="font-family:&quot;Symbol Accentuated&quot;">Ã?logoV, </span>Â’irrationalÂ’.

<a href="#_ftnref56" id="_ftn56"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[56]</span></a> The first half of the troparion develops a horticultural metaphor, based on the story of the FallÂ—Â‘sin which sprouted by a treeÂ’Â—with an allusion to the CrossÂ—Â‘your shootÂ’.

<a href="#_ftnref57" id="_ftn57"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[57]</span></a> Jonas 2:1-10. There is a number of verbal echoes of JonasÂ’s prayer in this troparion. The image in the second clause is, as the commentators say, Â‘boldÂ’.

<a href="#_ftnref58" id="_ftn58"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:

<a href="#_ftnref59" id="_ftn59"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:

<a href="#_ftnref60" id="_ftn60"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[60]</span></a> Literally Â‘strangeÂ’, with a play on the first word of the troparion, but this really does not work in contemporary English.

<a href="#_ftnref61" id="_ftn61"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[61]</span></a> Appropriately this is the word used by the Mother of God in the ChurchÂ’s text of the *Magnificat*, Â‘For he that is mighty has done great things for meÂ’ (Luke 1:49).

<a href="#_ftnref62" id="_ftn62"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[62]</span></a> A further series of plays on words, here on the words <span style="font-family:&quot;Symbol Accentuated&quot;">Ã?cronoV</span>Â—Â‘timelessÂ’Â—, <span style="font-family:&quot;Symbol Accentuated&quot;">crÃ³noV</span>Â—Â‘timeÂ’ and <span style="font-family:&quot;Symbol Accentuated&quot;">crÃ³nioV</span>Â—Â‘chronicÂ’.

<a href="#_ftnref63" id="_ftn63"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:

<a href="#_ftnref64" id="_ftn64"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[64]</span></a> John 18:22. The word only occurs four times in the Bible, here and in the plural at Mark 14:65, John 19:3 and Isaias 50:6, Â‘I gave my back to scourges and my cheeks to blowsÂ’.

<a href="#_ftnref65" id="_ftn65"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[65]</span></a> The word *alastor* is used frequently of the devil in the liturgical texts, but it only occurs four times in the Septuagint, three of them in 4 Maccabees and one in 2 Maccabees, where it is used of Antiochus Epiphanes and once of the Â‘avengerÂ’ who will punish him. In classical Greek it seems to have originally meant an Â‘avenging deityÂ’.

<a href="#_ftnref66" id="_ftn66"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[66]</span></a> Matt. 27:51.

<a href="#_ftnref67" id="_ftn67"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:

<a href="#_ftnref68" id="_ftn68"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[68]</span></a> This is the title of one of the best known Ethiopic hymns to the Mother of God.

<a href="#_ftnref69" id="_ftn69"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[69]</span></a> The phrase Â‘gates of repentanceÂ’ is not scriptural, nor does it occur in any of the principal Fathers. It is, of course, well known from the Troparion after Psalm 50 at Sunday Matins in the Triodion. The nearest biblical text is Ps. 117:19, Â‘Open to me the gates of justiceÂ—<span style="font-family:&quot;Symbol Accentuated&quot;">dikaiosÃºnhV</span>Â’, and the liturgical text seems to be an adaptation of it.

<a href="#_ftnref70" id="_ftn70"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[70]</span></a> This word is only attested once in Greek, from the 7th century writer Leontios of Neapolis, as quoted by St John of Damascus, by whom it is used of the Burning Bush.

<a href="#_ftnref71" id="_ftn71"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:

<a href="#_ftnref72" id="_ftn72"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[72]</span></a> Even in English the play on the word Â‘lightÂ’ is clear. In fact the Greek uses three different words, <span style="font-family:&quot;Symbol Accentuated&quot;">Ã¶lÃ³f</span>w<span style="font-family:&quot;Symbol Accentuated&quot;">toV</span>Â—Â‘wholly lightÂ’, <span style="font-family:&quot;Symbol Accentuated&quot;">fwtodÃ³toV</span>Â—Â‘giver of lightÂ’, and <span style="font-family:&quot;Symbol Accentuated&quot;">fÃ´V</span>Â—Â‘lightÂ’.

<a href="#_ftnref73" id="_ftn73"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[73]</span></a> The Â‘cherubim throneÂ’ is a reference to the divine chariot in Ezekiel 1. Later, in chapter 10, the four living creatures are identified by the prophet as the cherubim: Â‘And the Cherubim were lifted up. This was the living creature I had seen by the river ChobarÂ’ (10,15).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Greek text has a number of variant readings here. I translate what is most likely to have been the text known to the writer of the canon.

<a href="#_ftnref74" id="_ftn74"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character: footnote; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">[74]</span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The word used here for a Â‘bridal chamberÂ’ is *pastas*, which does not occur in Scripture. In the liturgical texts it nearly always recalls Psalm 18,6, where the word is the related word *pastos*. In a fragment on Psalm 18, attributed to St Athanasios, both words are found together with the typology of the Mother of God. </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;GR Times New Roman&quot;;
