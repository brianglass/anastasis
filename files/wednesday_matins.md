[When the stone had been sealed.]{style="color:red"}

We worship the tree of your Cross, lover of humankind, because you, the

the Orthodox Bible, at 2 Cor. 6:15. In the OT the word Â‘belialÂ’, which
in Hebrew means Â‘worthlessnessÂ’, Â‘good for nothingÂ’, occurs many
times, but it is never taken to be a proper name in the lxx, which
translates it by Â‘lawlessÂ’, Â‘pestilentÂ’ and other such words. The
Vulgate and older English versions tended to treat the word as a proper
name, but most modern versions do not so regard it. In later writings,
such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, the *Testament of Levi* and the *Ascension
of Isaias*, it has become a name for the devil. In the latter we read
(2:4), Â‘And Manasses turned away his own heart to serve Beliar Â—for
the angel of lawlessness, who is the ruler of this world, is BeliarÂ’.

[[\[64\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference style="mso-special-character:

[[\[65\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference style="mso-special-character:

of the devil in the liturgical texts, but it only occurs four times in
the Septuagint, three of them in 4 Maccabees and one in 2 Maccabees,
where it is used of Antiochus Epiphanes and once of the Â‘avengerÂ’ who
will punish him. In classical Greek it seems to have originally meant an
Â‘avenging deityÂ’.

</div>

<div id="ftn69" style="mso-element:footnote">

[[\[69\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference style="mso-special-character:
footnote"}](#_ftnref69){#_ftn69} The phrase Â‘gates of repentanceÂ’ is
not scriptural, nor does it occur in any of the principal Fathers. It
is, of course, well known from the Troparion after Psalm 50 at Sunday
Matins in the Triodion. The nearest biblical text is Ps. 117:19, Â‘Open
to me the gates of
justiceÂ—[dikaiosÃºnhV]{style="font-family:"Symbol Accentuated""}Â’, and
the liturgical text seems to be an adaptation of it.

</div>

<div id="ftn70" style="mso-element:footnote">

[[\[70\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference style="mso-special-character:

Greek, from the 7th century writer Leontios of Neapolis, as quoted by St
John of Damascus, by whom it is used of the Burning Bush.

<div id="ftn72" style="mso-element:footnote">

[[\[72\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference style="mso-special-character:

Â‘lightÂ’ is clear. In fact the Greek uses three different words,
[Ã¶lÃ³f]{style="font-family:"Symbol Accentuated""}w[toV]{style="font-family:"Symbol Accentuated""}Â—Â‘wholly
lightÂ’, [fwtodÃ³toV]{style="font-family:"Symbol Accentuated""}Â—Â‘giver

[[\[73\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference style="mso-special-character:

to the divine chariot in Ezekiel 1. Later, in chapter 10, the four
living creatures are identified by the prophet as the cherubim: Â‘And
the Cherubim were lifted up. This was the living creature I had seen by
the river ChobarÂ’ (10,15).[  ]{style="mso-spacerun: yes"}The Greek text
has a number of variant readings here. I translate what is most likely
to have been the text known to the writer of the canon.

The word used here for a Â‘bridal chamberÂ’ is *pastas*, which does not
occur in Scripture. In the liturgical texts it nearly always recalls
Psalm 18,6, where the word is the related word *pastos*. In a fragment
on Psalm 18, attributed to St Athanasios, both words are found together
with the typology of the Mother of God.
