[Venerable Father, God-bearer Theodosios, valiantly you struggled in
this temporary life, by hymns and fasts and vigils becoming a model for
your disciples, while now you dance with the Bodiless Powers, as you
ceaselessly glorify Christ, God from God, Word and Redeemer, who bowed
down his to the Forerunner and sanctified the nature of the waters.
Entreat him, implore him, Venerable Father, that the Church may be given
harmony, peace and great mercy.

[Venerable Father, God-bearer Theodosios, the grace of the All-holy
Spirit, finding your pure soul, as it desired, dwelt in you as an
immaculate light. By its action you became radiantly bright and you
ceaselessly glorify Christ, the one Son in two natures, who was baptized
by the hand of the Forerunner and witnessed to by the FatherÂ’s voice.
Entreat him, implore him, Venerable Father, that the inhabited world may
be given harmony, peace and great mercy.

[Venerable Father, God-bearer Theodosios, rightly you were counted
worthy of the blessed life, having found it by purity and ascetic
practice; for while living you passed over to the life on high, bidding
all things farewell, and with the Bodiless Powers ceaselessly glorifying
Christ, who took flesh ineffably from a Virgin and sunk our sins by
Baptism in JordanÂ’s streams. Entreat him, implore him, Venerable
Father, that the inhabited world may be given harmony, peace and great
mercy. [\[Twice\]]{style="color:red"}]{style="font-size:14.0pt;

[Glory. [Tone

[Venerable Father, they rejoice your holy soul like a city of the living
God, the torrents of the river, of the water of forgiveness, of the One
who passed through Jordan and for all the ends of the earth became a
source of the message of true religion, Christ our God. Implore him,
most blessed Theodosios that our souls may be
saved.[[\[1\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference

[Ι ]{style="color:red"}Â‘See how I wear your image which I fashioned,
humbling myself beyond understandingÂ’, said the Lord, Â‘What is strange
then, my friend, if I bow low beneath your right hand, like one of your
fellow servants, and stripped naked wrap myself in the waters? For I
wish to clothe those who have been stripped naked with everlasting
incorruption.Â’

Glory. [Tone 8.\
By the Studite.]{style="color:red"}

We, the multitudes of monastics, honour you, our Father Theodosios, for
through you we have learnt to walk the truly straight path. Blessed are
you, for you became ChristÂ’s slave and triumphed over the power of the
foe, companion of Angels, colleague of the Venerable and the Righteous.
With them intercede with the Lord to have mercy on our souls.

[Apolytikion. Tone 8.]{style="color:red"}

With the streams of your tears you cultivated the barren desert, and
with deep sighings from the heart you made your toils bring forth fruit
a hundredfold, and you became a beacon, shining in all the world by your
wonders, our venerable Father Theodosios; intercede with Christ God that
our souls may be saved.

As you were baptized in the Jordan, Lord, the worship of the Trinity was
made manifest; for the voice of the Father bore witness to you, naming
you the Beloved Son; and the Spirit, in the form of a dove, confirmed
the sureness of the word. Christ God, who appeared and enlightened the
world, glory to you!

This Doxastikon is based on the Psalm 45:5, Â‘The torrents of the river
rejoice the city of God; the Most High has sanctified his tabernacleÂ’.
The river is identified with Christ, or with the Holy Spirit, in a
number of passages from the Fathers. Euthymios Zigavenos comments, Â‘The
river is Christ, because of the sweet streams of his teachings that
water and rejoice the souls of Christians and bring to produce the
fruits of virtue. For the Lord says, through Isaias, Â‘See, I turn
towards them as a river of peaceÂ’ \[66:12\]Â’. The torrents are also
identified with the
Apostles.]{style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

The three prosomia in Tone 4 look like part of an acrostic poem by
Joseph the Hymnographer and are part of dialogue between Christ and St
John the Baptist. I have included the Greek initial letters to indicate
this. There is a similar problem in the Aposticha of Lauds on the 4th
and 5th of January, where a poem of Joseph has been dismembered and
rearranged.]{style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}
