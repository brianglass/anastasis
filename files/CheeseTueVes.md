TUESDAY OF CHEESE WEEK
======================

AT VESPERS
----------

****

At

Lord, I have cried **the Stichera from the Octoichos and the Menaion.**

At the Aposticha, the following Idiomel twice, said with the usual verses, as yesterday.

Tone 1.

With great joy, believers, let us welcome the inspired proclamation of the Fast, as the Ninevites did of old and as prostitutes and tax collectors the preaching of repentance by John. Through self-mastery let us prepare for communion of the Master’s sacred mystery in Sion. Through tears let us be cleansed before the divine Washing of the feet there. Let us pray to see there the fulfilment of the Pascha that was a type and revelation of the true. Let us be made ready for the worship of the Cross and the Rising of Christ our God, as we cry out to him, ‘Do not put us to shame and deprive us of our expectation, O Lover of mankind!’

****

Verse 1.

To you I lift up my eyes, to you who are enthroned in the heavens. As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master: or as the eyes of a maid toward the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God: until he show us his mercy.

Verse 2.

Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we have our fill of derision; our soul has its fill. Mockery for those at ease: and derision for the proud. ****

Of the Martyrs.

How fair was your transaction, O Saints! For you gave your blood and inherited heaven, and though tested for a moment, you rejoice eternally. Your merchandise was truly fair! For abandoning things corruptible, you received incorruptible and, as you dance with Angels, you sing without ceasing the praise of the consubstantial Trinity.

Glory. Both now.

**Cross-Theotokion. All-praised Martyrs.**

The Virgin without spot, when she saw on the Tree the One to whom she had given birth from a womb without seed, unable to endure the wound in her inmost being, worn out by grief she said, ‘How have you been raised on a Cross as one condemned, who hold fast all creation by your decree? Truly you wish to save humanity’.

****

After the

Now Master **and the Trisagion Prayers, the Apolytikion** Virgin Mother of God **and the others, with prostrations at each.** Lord, have mercy **40 times.** Glory. Both now**.** Greater in honour **and Dismissal.** \[**See Weekday Vespers in Great Lent**\]
