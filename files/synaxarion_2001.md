 

This page contains the short Synaxarion for the feasts from 9 April to
15 April, since many churches celebrate Matins, when the Greek tradition
is to read the Synaxarion entries from the Menaion, each day during the
Great and Holy Week. I have yet to complete my version of the Synaxarion
of the Triodion. During Holy Week the Russian Triodion gives the full
Synaxarion for each day.

The translations are free, in order to reproduce the Iambic Trimeters
and Epic Hexameters of the original. The transcriptions of the Greek
words, included to draw attention to the many paronomasias of the
original, are practical, rather than consistent and scientific. The
stressed syllable in unfamiliar proper names are marked with an acute
accent.
