 

This page contains the short Synaxarion for the feasts from 9 April to 15 April, since many churches celebrate Matins, when the Greek tradition is to read the Synaxarion entries from the Menaion, each day during the Great and Holy Week. I have yet to complete my version of the Synaxarion of the Triodion. During Holy Week the Russian Triodion gives the full Synaxarion for each day.

The translations are free, in order to reproduce the Iambic Trimeters and Epic Hexameters of the original. The transcriptions of the Greek words, included to draw attention to the many paronomasias of the original, are practical, rather than consistent and scientific. The stressed syllable in unfamiliar proper names are marked with an acute accent.
