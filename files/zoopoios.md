## ZOOPOIOS

The Greek word *zoopoios* is extremely frequent in the liturgical texts,
very commonly used as an epithet of the Holy Spirit. Many translations
of our texts use the strange hyphenated adjective *life-creating* to
render the Greek word. This is an example of “etymologising“
translation, too frequently encountered in Orthodox books in English.
The short paper below attempts to explain why *life-giving* is the most
appropriate translation of the word.
