Today the holy Mother, who is higher than the Holy Place, has come to the Holy Place, revealing to the world the Maker of the world and the Giver of the law.

font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">The Lord spoke to Moses on the day on which he brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, saying, ‘Sanctify to me every first-born, first produced that opens every womb among the children of Israel’. And Moses said to the people, ‘Remember this day, on which you came out of Egypt, from the house of slavery, for the Lord has brought you out from there with a mighty hand. And keep his law. And it shall be that when the Lord God brings you into the land of the Chananites, in the way that he swore to your fathers, you shall set apart everything that opens the womb; the males to the Lord. But if after this your son asks you, saying, ‘What is this?’, you will say to him, ‘God brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery, with a mighty hand. And when Pharao hardened his heart against sending us out, the Lord slew every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of humans to the first-born of animals. This is why I sacrifice everything that opens the womb; the males to the Lord, and every first-born of my sons I will redeem’. And it will be for a sign upon your hand, and immovable before your eyes, because thus said the Lord the Almighty, ‘All the first-born of your sons you will give me. \[<span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Leviticus 12</span>\] And it shall be that everyone<a href="02feb.md" id="_ftnref14"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote">[14]</span></span></a> who gives birth to a male child shall circumcise the flesh of its foreskin on the eighth day. And for thirty three days he will not come into the sanctuary of God to the Priest, until the days of purification are completed. And after this he will offer an unblemished yearling lamb to the Lord for a holocaust, and a young pigeon or turtle dove to the Priest at the door of the Tabernacle of Witness. Or instead of these he will offer two young pigeons or two turtle doves. And the Priest will make atonement for him. \[<span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:

And Seraphim stood around him, the one having six wings and the other having six wings, and with two they covered their faces and with two the feet and with two they flew. And one cried to other and they said, ‘Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord Sabaoth. The whole earth is full of his glory.’ The threshold was lifted up at the voice with which they cried, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said, ‘Woe is me! For I am pricked to the heart, because I, a human being, and with unclean lips dwell among a people with unclean lips, and with my eyes I have seen the King, the Lord Sabaoth.’ And one of the Seraphim was sent to me, and in his hand he held a burning coal, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. And touched my mouth and said, ‘See, this has touched your lips and it will take away your iniquities and cleanse your sins.’ And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I send? And who will go to this people?’ And I said, ‘See, here am I. Send me.’ And he said, ‘Go, and say to this people, ‘You will hear and not understand, and seeing, you will see and not perceive.’ For the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard with heavy ears and they have shut their eyes, lest perhaps they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn back, and I will heal them.’ And I said, ‘Until when, Lord?’ And he said, ‘Until the cities are deserted from being inhabited and the houses from there being no people, and the land will be abandoned as desert. And after this God will remove the people far away, and those who are left behind will be multiplied on the land’.</span>

And the Egyptians will drink water that is beside the sea, while the river will fail and be dried up. Thus says the Lord, ‘Where now are your wise men? And let them declare to you and let them say, ‘What has the Lord Sabaoth planned against Egypt?’ On that day the Egyptians will be like women, in fear and trembling in the presence of the hand of the Lord Sabaoth, which he will bring against them. And there will be an Altar to the Lord in the country of the Egyptians and a pillar to Lord at its border. And it will be for a sign for ever to the Lord in the country of Egypt, because they will cry to the Lord and he will send them a man who will save them. And the Lord will be known to the Egyptians. And the Egyptians will know the Lord in that day, and they will offer sacrifice and gift, and they will vow vows to the Lord and pay them.<a href="02feb.md" id="_ftnref16"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:footnote">[16]</span></span></a></span>

<a href="02feb.md" id="_ftn1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[1]</span></span></a> Luke 2,29. Further references to the frequent quotations from the *Nunc Dimittis* will not be given. The Greek word<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>means more than ‘let depart’, as does the Latin ‘dimitto’. It means to ‘release’, ‘loose’, set free’. It may have financial, military, legal or social connotations; ‘discharge a debt’, ‘disband or discharge troops’, ‘acquit’ or even ‘divorce’, as at Matthew 1,19. It is also used in the LXX euphemistically of ‘dying’, e.g. Gen. 15,2; Numbers 20,29; Tobit 3,6.13. ‘Dismiss’ is perhaps too dismissive, so I tentatively propose ‘release’. The word also occurs at Matthew 15,23, where the Disciples say to Jesus of the Phoenician woman, ‘Let her go‘ (implying ‘with her request granted‘). Nearly all Enlgish versions have ‘Send her away‘. This is far too harsh and distorts the true meaning of the passage.

<a href="02feb.md" id="_ftn12"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[12]</span></span></a> I take the aorist participle here to be a true passive. The *Festal Menaion* <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>takes it as active.

<a href="02feb.md" id="_ftn13"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[13]</span></span></a> This reading is a selection from Exodus 12,51-13,16 together with 22,29 and passages from Leviticus 12 and Numbers 8. The reference to the purification of the mother in Leviticus is made to refer to the child. This may be influenced by Luke 2,22, which has ‘their’, not ‘her’, or, according to the Western text, ‘his’. The text in *The Festal Menaion* is misleading, being translated from the Hebrew, not the Greek of the Menaion, which differs noticeably from the LXX.

<a href="02feb.md" id="_ftn14"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[14]</span></span></a> This is masculine, though the LXX has ‘woman’.

<a href="02feb.md" id="_ftn15"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[15]</span></span></a> This last clause is not from any of the texts used in the reading. The phrase ‘God the Most High’ only occurs at Gen. 14,20 and Psalm 77,35. The second is characteristic of Isaias, and the two nearest references are 30,12 & 15. But the whole clause is probably a mere commonplace by the compiler.

<a href="02feb.md" id="_ftn16"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[16]</span></span></a> Note in the Menaion. ‘Instead of the above reading, the manuscripts have another from the prophecy of Ezekiel 43 & 44 \[i.e. the normal one for the Mother of God\]. While what seems to be the oldest of the manuscripts has neither it, nor a Liti, nor Kathismata, but only the Aposticha with one Doxastikon in the same Tone, ‘A light for revelation of the nations’, which is to be found at Vespers on the 4th of the month.’

<a href="02feb.md" id="_ftn18"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[18]</span></span></a> Daniel 7,13 \[LXX\]. The Church normally uses Theodotion’s version of Daniel, but some of the Greek and Syriac texts suppose the Septuagint. In this version we read, ‘The Son of man was present as Ancient of Days and those who stood round were present with him’, not, as in Theodotion and the Aramaic, ‘And he reached the Ancient of Days and was brought before him’. These two versions explain why Christ is also given the title ‘Ancient of Days, in some liturgical texts.

<a href="02feb.md" id="_ftn52"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[52]</span></span></a> Much of this ode is based on Isaias, from whom the fifth biblical ode (26,9-20) is taken. The Irmos refers to Isaias 6,1-7. ‘Escorted’ is the word used of the Angels in the Cherubic Hymn. The last two lines, which are somewhat freely translated for reasons of rhythm, may be inspired by Isaias 26,9.12. The earliest attested use of the word ‘that knows no evening’ is in Origen.

<a href="02feb.md" id="_ftn53"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[53]</span></span></a> This prepares for the allusion to Isaias 6,6-7 in the next Troparion.

<a href="02feb.md" id="_ftn54"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character:
footnote">[54]</span></span></a> This typology of the burning coal is common in the texts, though more frequently it is used of the Eucharist. The word in Greek for the ‘spoon’ used to give Communion to the faithful really means ‘a pair of tongs’, with a direct allusion to the vision of Isaias. Immediately after receiving Communion the priest is directed to say Isaias 6,7.
