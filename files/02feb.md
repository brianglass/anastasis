[The Lord spoke to Moses on the day on which he brought the children of
Israel out of the land of Egypt, saying, ‘Sanctify to me every
first-born, first produced that opens every womb among the children of
Israel’. And Moses said to the people, ‘Remember this day, on which you
came out of Egypt, from the house of slavery, for the Lord has brought
you out from there with a mighty hand. And keep his law. And it shall be
that when the Lord God brings you into the land of the Chananites, in
the way that he swore to your fathers, you shall set apart everything
that opens the womb; the males to the Lord. But if after this your son
asks you, saying, ‘What is this?’, you will say to him, ‘God brought us
out of Egypt, from the house of slavery, with a mighty hand. And when
Pharao hardened his heart against sending us out, the Lord slew every
first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of humans to the
first-born of animals. This is why I sacrifice everything that opens the
womb; the males to the Lord, and every first-born of my sons I will
redeem’. And it will be for a sign upon your hand, and immovable before
your eyes, because thus said the Lord the Almighty, ‘All the first-born
of your sons you will give me. \[[Leviticus

everyone[[[\[14\]]{style="mso-special-character:footnote"}]{.MsoFootnoteReference}](02feb.md){#_ftnref14}
who gives birth to a male child shall circumcise the flesh of its
foreskin on the eighth day. And for thirty three days he will not come
into the sanctuary of God to the Priest, until the days of purification
are completed. And after this he will offer an unblemished yearling lamb
to the Lord for a holocaust, and a young pigeon or turtle dove to the
Priest at the door of the Tabernacle of Witness. Or instead of these he
will offer two young pigeons or two turtle doves. And the Priest will
make atonement for him.

[In the year that King Ozias died, I saw the Lord, seated on a high and

around him, the one having six wings and the other having six wings, and
with two they covered their faces and with two the feet and with two
they flew. And one cried to other and they said, ‘Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord
Sabaoth. The whole earth is full of his glory.’ The threshold was lifted
up at the voice with which they cried, and the house was filled with
smoke. And I said, ‘Woe is me! For I am pricked to the heart, because I,
a human being, and with unclean lips dwell among a people with unclean
lips, and with my eyes I have seen the King, the Lord Sabaoth.’ And one
of the Seraphim was sent to me, and in his hand he held a burning coal,
which he had taken with tongs from the altar. And touched my mouth and
said, ‘See, this has touched your lips and it will take away your
iniquities and cleanse your sins.’ And I heard the voice of the Lord
saying, ‘Whom shall I send? And who will go to this people?’ And I said,
‘See, here am I. Send me.’ And he said, ‘Go, and say to this people,
‘You will hear and not understand, and seeing, you will see and not
perceive.’ For the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have
heard with heavy ears and they have shut their eyes, lest perhaps they
perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with
their heart and turn back, and I will heal them.’ And I said, ‘Until
when, Lord?’ And he said, ‘Until the cities are deserted from being
inhabited and the houses from there being no people, and the land will
be abandoned as desert. And after this God will remove the people far
away, and those who are left behind will be multiplied on the

[See, the Lord will be seated on a light cloud and will come to Egypt
and the idols of Egypt will be shaken at his presence and their heart
will be worsted within them. ‘And their spirit will be troubled within
them, and I will frustrate their counsel and hand Egypt over into the
hands of harsh lords,’ says the Lord Sabaoth. And the Egyptians will
drink water that is beside the sea, while the river will fail and be
dried up. Thus says the Lord, ‘Where now are your wise men? And let them
declare to you and let them say, ‘What has the Lord Sabaoth planned
against Egypt?’ On that day the Egyptians will be like women, in fear
and trembling in the presence of the hand of the Lord Sabaoth, which he
will bring against them. And there will be an Altar to the Lord in the
country of the Egyptians and a pillar to Lord at its border. And it will
be for a sign for ever to the Lord in the country of Egypt, because they
will cry to the Lord and he will send them a man who will save them. And
the Lord will be known to the Egyptians. And the Egyptians will know the
Lord in that day, and they will offer sacrifice and gift, and they will
vow vows to the Lord and pay

references to the frequent quotations from the *Nunc Dimittis* will not
be given. The Greek word[  ]{style="mso-spacerun: yes"}means more than
‘let depart’, as does the Latin ‘dimitto’. It means to ‘release’,
‘loose’, set free’. It may have financial, military, legal or social
connotations; ‘discharge a debt’, ‘disband or discharge troops’,
‘acquit’ or even ‘divorce’, as at Matthew 1,19. It is also used in the
LXX euphemistically of ‘dying’, e.g. Gen. 15,2; Numbers 20,29; Tobit
3,6.13. ‘Dismiss’ is perhaps too dismissive, so I tentatively propose
‘release’. The word also occurs at Matthew 15,23, where the Disciples
say to Jesus of the Phoenician woman, ‘Let her go‘ (implying ‘with her
request granted‘). Nearly all Enlgish versions have ‘Send her away‘.
This is far too harsh and distorts the true meaning of the passage.

<div id="ftn13" style="mso-element:footnote">

[[[\[13\]]{style="mso-special-character:

selection from Exodus 12,51-13,16 together with 22,29 and passages from
Leviticus 12 and Numbers 8. The reference to the purification of the
mother in Leviticus is made to refer to the child. This may be
influenced by Luke 2,22, which has ‘their’, not ‘her’, or, according to
the Western text, ‘his’. The text in *The Festal Menaion* is misleading,
being translated from the Hebrew, not the Greek of the Menaion, which
differs noticeably from the LXX.

some of the Greek and Syriac texts suppose the Septuagint. In this
version we read, ‘The Son of man was present as Ancient of Days and
those who stood round were present with him’, not, as in Theodotion and
the Aramaic, ‘And he reached the Ancient of Days and was brought before

The Irmos refers to Isaias 6,1-7. ‘Escorted’ is the word used of the
Angels in the Cherubic Hymn. The last two lines, which are somewhat
freely translated for reasons of rhythm, may be inspired by Isaias
26,9.12. The earliest attested use of the word ‘that knows no evening’

Communion to the faithful really means ‘a pair of tongs’, with a direct
allusion to the vision of Isaias. Immediately after receiving Communion
the priest is directed to say Isaias 6,7.

hymn attributed to St Ephrem we find a similar idea, ‘Mary carried a
child who by his wisdom begot Adam’.

<div id="ftn61" style="mso-element:footnote">

[[[\[61\]]{style="mso-special-character:
footnote"}]{.MsoFootnoteReference}](02feb.md){#_ftn61}This is
reminiscent of St Cyril of Jerusalem’s homily. ‘He who grasps the whole
earth in his hand is contained in the arms of an elder. And he who bears
the universe by the word of his power is being carried’. PG 33,1196.

[[[\[63\]]{style="mso-special-character:

eardrums’.

[[[\[75\]]{style="mso-special-character:

Megalynaria have an alphabetical acrostic from A to O, but omitting I
and X. The letter Alpha begins both the first and second. This gives a
total of fourteen, the normal number of Troparia in a Canon. The last
two do not form part of the acrostic, and seem to be a later addition.
They bring the total to the unusual number of sixteen. The Slavonic set
are, for the most part, quite different. They number only fourteen.
