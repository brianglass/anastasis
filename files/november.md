THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER
=====================

(**Having 30 days. The day has 10 hours and the night 14**)

1. Of the holy and wonder-working, unmercenary physicians, Cosmas and Damian; and of their venerable mother Theodotes.

<img src="KosDamNov.gif" alt="KosDamNov.gif (63480 bytes)" width="120" height="210" />

They were from Asia, and their father was a pagan. After his death, their Christ-loving mother now having found freedom, brought them up devoutly and taught them every form of virtue and knowledge, in particular medicine. They took this up as their profession and went around every disease and weakness, giving their cures without payment both to all humans and also to animals, hence they were given the epithet ‘Unmercenaries’. In this way they completed the course of their lives and died in peace.

4. Of our venerable father Ioannikios the Great; and of the holy hieromartyrs Nikander, bishop of Myra, and Hermaios, presbyter.

They drew many unbelievers to the faith of Christ; they were denounced to the count of the city, Livanios, by whom, after many other torments, they were immured alive into a tomb, and so handed their spirits into the hands of God. The ascetic was born in Bithynia, around the year 740; his father was named Myritikes, his mother Anastaso, and from his early manhood he served as a soldier and was found worthy of royal honours for his courage. Later he came to despise them all and left for Mt Olympus, where he passed the rest of life as an ascetic, and having become mighty in virtue, he fell asleep in the Lord in 834, having lived for all of 94 years. His is the brief prayer: ‘The Father is my hope,’ etc.

He was a son of Kleitophon and Lefkippi, who at first had both been pagans, but were later taught the true faith by a certain Christian, named Onouphrios. Epistimi was also the child of unbelieving parents and was baptised because of her marriage to Galakteon. They were martyred under Decius around 250.

A native of Thessaloniki, he was first a priest and then bishop of the Church of Constantinople; a distinguished man, generous, upright for things of God, witnessing by the goodness of his life. He was a most fervent zealot for the Council of Nicea and a most valiant champion of the faith in the Homoousios until death. But he was on two occasions exiled from his throne by the arianising Emperor Constantius, son of Constantine the Great, finally he was exiled around 350 to Koukousos in Armenia, where at the instigation of the Arians, those who were taking him into exile throttled him.

They were martyred under Diocletian and Maximianos in 290. Lazarus led the ascetic life under Constantine Monomachos. He was born in 967, travelled round various regions of the East to visit monasteries and, having returned to his own country in 1005, he built the monasteries of Mt Galisios after 1012 and fell asleep in the Lord on the 7th of November 1053.

8. The Assembly of the Chief Captain Michael and the rest of the Bodiless Powers.

<img src="GabrMich.gif" alt="GabrMich.gif (65466 bytes)" width="201" height="265" />

All the Angels, according to the Apostle Paul, are ministering spirits, sent out for those who are to inherit salvation \[Heb. 1:14\]. God has established them as guardians over every nation and people, and as guides for what is good \[Lev. 32:8\]. He orders them to guard those who hope in him, that nothing may harm them, that no evil may draw near their dwellings \[Ps. 6:9-14\]. In heaven they look continually on the face of God, as they sing to him the thrice-holy hymn and intercede before him on our behalf, as they likewise also rejoice over one sin who repents \[Is. 6:2-3; Mt. 18:10; Lk. 15:7; Acts 12:15\]. In a word they serve God for our benefit in so many ways that the pages of the holy Scriptures are full of accounts of them.

Therefore the orthodox Church, gratefully honouring these divine ministers and our protectors and guardians, ordains to-day this present assembly, that is our gathering for their common feast and praise; but especially of the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, as they are mentioned by name in the Scriptures. Michael means ‘Who is as God?’, while Gabriel means ‘Power of God’. The number of the Angels is not defined by holy Scripture, though Daniel says thousands upon thousands minister to God and ten thousands upon ten thousands stand before him \[7:10\]. Nevertheless they are all divided into nine ranks called: Thrones, Cherubim, Seraphim, Dominions, Powers, Authorities, Principalities, Archangels and Angels.

****

No work and permission for wine and oil.

Apolytikion. Tone 4. Lifted upon the Cross.

Chief captains of the heavenly armies, we the unworthy implore you to protect us by your supplications with the shelter of the wings of your immaterial glory as you guard us who fall down and insistently cry out: Deliver us from dangers, as Captains of the Powers above.

****

Kontakion. Tone 2.

Chief captains of God, ministers of divine glory, guides of mankind and princes of the Bodiless ones, ask for what is for our good and for great mercy, as Chief Captains of the Bodiless ones.

9. Of the holy martyrs Onesiphoros and Porphyrios; and of our venerable mother Matrona; and of our Father among the Saints Nekatarios of Pentapolis.

The martyrs suffered under Diocletian and Maximianos in the year 290. The ascetic was from Perge in Pamphylia and flourished around 466; she had been married to a husband and had a daughter by him; after her husband’s death she entrusted her to a certain wise woman, while she herself ended her life ascetically. She lived to be almost a hundred.. Saint Nektarios was from Selyvria in Thrace, and was devoted to God from childhood. When he had been carefully educated he was consecrated Metropolitan of Pentapolis in Egypt. He came to Greece and passed his life in virtue, wisdom and the other precepts of the Gospel. By divine counsel he founded the women’s monastery of the Holy Trinity in Aegina, where he spent the rest of his life in holiness and virtue, in constant prayer and humility. He fell asleep in 1920. In the same monastery, which already bears his name, are preserved his sacred relics, which ineffably give off a sweet fragrance and are the source of numerous wonders.

****

Apolytikia: of the Martyrs. Tone 4. \[Common\]

In you, Mother, was preserved unimpaired that which is according to the image, for you took up the cross, and you followed Christ; and by your deeds you have taught us to despise the flesh, for it passes away; but to care for the soul, which is a thing immortal; and therefore your spirit, holy Matrona, rejoices with the Angels.

****

Of St Nektarios. Tone 1. Citizen of the desert.

Selyvria’s offspring and Aegina’s guardian, the true friend of virtue, revealed in these last times, Nektarios let us the faithful praise as inspired servant of Christ; for he pours out healings of every kind for those who devoutly cry: Glory to Christ who gave you glory! Glory to him who made you wondrous! Glory to him who through you works healings for all!

****

The newly shining star of Orthodoxy, and new-built outer rampart of the Church of Christ let us sing his praises with joy of heart, for by the power of the Spirit glorified he pours out abundant grace of healings for those who cry aloud: Hail, Father Nektarios!

10. Of the holy apostles of the Seventy, Olympas, Rhodion, Erastes, Sosipater and Quartus, and of the holy martyr Orestes.

Of these Olympas and Rhodion, or Herodion \[Rom. 16:11\], followed Peter the prince of the Apostles to Rome, where their heads were cut off by Nero. The others ended their lives in peace, having become bishops, Sosipater of Iconium, Quartus of Beirut, Erastes of Paneas or Paneias (which was renamed Caesarea Philippi), he had been appointed treasurer of the Church in Corinth \[Rom. 16:22\]. The martyr was from Tyana in Cappadocia in the time of Diocletian. Holes were bored in his ankles by long nails, he was bound to a wild horse, dragged violently along by it and expired, in the year 289.

The Apostles’ festival has been made manifest to-day, manifestly granting forgiveness of offences to all who celebrate their memorial.

11. Of the holy martyrs Menas, Victor and Vincent; and of the holy Martyr Stephanis; and of our venerable Father Theodore the Studite.

Menas was an Egyptian who suffered in Kotyaeios in Phrygia in 296 under Diocletian and Maximianos; Victor and Stephanis in Italy in 160 under Antonius; Vincent in Spain in 235 under Maximinus.

Theodore the Studite was born in Constantinople in 759 of devout parents, Photeinos and Theoctisti; from his youth he was clothed in the monastic schema in the monastery known as that of Sakkodion, of which he became abbot in 794 (having been ordained deacon and priest around 784 by the most holy patriarch Tarasios). Later he transferred to the monastery of Studios, so called because it had been founded by Studios, a Roman consul, and he received the epithet ‘Studite’. He appeared as a fervent zealot for the traditions of the fathers; he fought till his death for the honour of the holy icons; he endured exile on three occasions because of his zeal for the true faith. On the third occasion he was condemned by the iconoclast Emperor Leo the Armenian; he endured nobly, being beaten and bound and being transferred from one gloomy dungeon to another even more stygian, for seven whole years. Finally he was recalled from exile by Michael Travlos, and after a short respite from his long labours he rested in the Lord on November 11th, 826, on a Sunday, when his disciples were kneeling round him and singing the ‘Blameless’. Some say that he himself, after receiving the spotless mysteries, began to sing this psalm; but that when he reached the verse: ‘I shall not forget your judgements for ever, for by them you have made me live’ (118:93), he expired, at the age of 67. Among his many other sacred writings he composed, with the co-operation of his own brother Joseph, almost the whole of the book, full of compunction, the Triodion (Cf. also July 14th).

13. Of our father among the saints John Chrysostom, archbishop of Constantinople.

<img src="ChrNov01.gif" alt="ChrNov01.gif (21380 bytes)" width="91" height="256" />

This great teacher of the inhabited world was born in Antioch the Great in 344 of devout parents, Secundus and Anthousa. He was a pupil the rhetor Livanios and the philosopher Andragathios. He was at first a monk in the hermitages around Antioch and later ordained priest of the church of Antioch in 383. He mounted the archiepiscopal throne on the 15th of December 397.

He was banished in 402 by Arkadios and Evdoxia, but after a short time he was recalled to his throne.

He was named Chrysostom because of his eloquence. He wrote a great many works and explained the divine Scriptures more than any other of the Fathers. 1,447 of his sermons have been preserved and 240 letters.

14. Of the holy and all-praised Apostle Philip.

He was one of the Twelve, from Bethsaida in Galilee, a fellow citizen of Andrew and Peter. Educated in the teachings of the Law, he devoted himself to the study of the prophetic books; and so Jesus called him to the rank of Apostle, he sought and at once found Nathanel, and said to him: We have found the one of whom Moses wrote in the Law, Jesus the son of Joseph from Nazareth (Jo. 1:46). He preached Jesus the God-man in many parts of Asia Minor, and having suffered much for his name, he was crucified head downwards in Hierapolis in Phrygia.

He wrote first in Palestine his version of the Gospel in Hebrew eight or nine, or, according to some, fifteen years after the Assumption of the Saviour.

He was born in Neocaesaria in Cappadocia of unbelieving parents. He studied in Athens, Alexandria, Beirut and finally in Caesarea for five years under Origen, by whom he was also instructed in the Christian faith. Then, in the year 240, he became bishop of his home country, in which he found only seventeen Christians. When he died in about 265 he left scarcely as many unbelievers. The whole period of his episcopate was a succession of remarkable wonders, from which he acquired the epithet ‘Wonderworker’, being called even by the enemies of the truth a ‘Second Moses’ (cf. Basil the Great, On the Holy Spirit Chap. 29).

****

Plato was martyred under the governor Agrippinos in 296, and was from the territory of the Galatians, from the city of Ankara. Romanos was from Antioch in the time of Maximianos. Arraigned before the eparch Asklepiades, and urged by him to worship idols, he asked that an infant be brought from the market-place, that it might be the judge of the proposed idea. When the infant was asked: Which God should one worship? it answered: The God of the Christians. It was then mercilessly flayed on the tyrant’s orders and then its head was struck off. The martyr had his tongue cut out and was thrown into goal, finally he was throttled there in 305. It was in this Romanos’ name that Saint Helen later founded the lovely church in Constantinople.

19. Of the holy Prophet Avdias \[Obadiah\].

The place and date at which the Prophet flourished is unclear from Holy Scripture; and so some say that he is the steward of Achab, who hid one hundred prophets in a cave from the wrath of Jezabel and fed them on bread and water (3 Kingd. 18:4), and that later he became a disciple of the prophet Elias in around 903 BC. While Kalmetis and his followers judge that from the words of his own prophecy, he was a little later than Joel (October 19th). He is also called Ovdiou, and Avdias and Ovdias. His prophecy consists of only one chapter and is placed fourth among the Minor Prophets.

Varlaam was from a village by Syrian Antioch; he was an old man and a farmer by profession. He was martyred in the time of Diocletian.

Philemon was from Kolossae, or Kolassae, a city in Phrygia, a man wealthy and of noble birth. Apphia was his wife, Archippos bishop of the Church in Kolossae. All three were disciples of the Apsotle Paul. St Onesimos, a non-Christian slave of Philemon, having stole from him, fled to Rome, but the Apsotle, having found him there and guided him to the way of virtue and to the knowledge of the truth, sent him back to his master Philemon, having also written him a letter in the year 64 (it is one of the 14 epistles of Paul), in which he supports this Onesimos. They all died as martyrs, being stoned to death by idolaters. St Cecilia was from Rome, of distinguished ancestry. She was betrothed to Vallerianous, whom she drew to the faith of Christ. He in turn converted his own brother Tirburtius. They were martyred under Diocletian in 288.

He abandoned parents and fatherland and travelled through the regions of the East, crying out to everyone, ‘Repent!’, from this he gained his epithet.

27. Of the holy Great martyr Jacob the Persian.

He was from the city of Vythava of distinguished ancestry, intimate and honoured friend of Isdigeis, or Iesezegirdis 1st, king of the Persians, who reigned from 399-425. Though a Christian through his parents, he denied Christ, seduced by the friendship and flattery of the king. Learning of this, his mother and wife informed him by letter that they would have no further dealings with him, preferring the love of Christ to passing glory. He, struck to his soul by these words and having come to himself, he repented of the sins he had committed, and abandoned his connection with the king. And so the latter was furiously angry and decreed against him the most painful death, such as no one would decree against a wild animal, that is to say his body was to be cut up joint by joint of arms and legs. And so the noble martyr was cut limb by limb as far as his thighs and shoulders. Finally his head was struck off.

28. Of the holy monk martyr Stephen the New; and of the holy martyr Irenarchos.

The ascetic was born in Constantinople in 715 of Orthodox parents, John and Anne. He led the ascetic life from his youth in the monastery of St Auxentios in Bithynia, which lies on high ground called the Mountain of St Auxentios. He became superior of the monks there and the fame of his spiritual struggles was heard of everywhere and the fair fragrance of his virtues drew many to him. He died a martyr because of his veneration of the holy ikons under Constantine Copronymos, by whom he was first condemned to eleven months in chains and prison, then he was dragged down on the ground and stoned like the proto-martyr Stephen, from whom Stephen the New was named. He was struck with wood against his membrane of his brain, and, when his head had been crushed, he gave up his spirit in 767. Irenarchos was from Sebasteia in the time of Diocletian, being in his youth an agent for the punishment of the holy martyrs. But once, while watching seven women being tortured for Christ and marvelling at their courage, because, though feeble by nature, they were most courageous against the tyrant and put him to shame, he was enlightened by divine grace. Then, having boldly confessed Christ, he was tortured by fire and water and his head was cut off alongside the holy women in 298.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 4. Lifted up on the Cross.
