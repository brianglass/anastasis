HOLY AND GREAT TUESDAY
======================

****

The Midnight Office is read in the Church

\[**and not, as usually on weekdays, in the Narthex, or Liti**\] **as during Great Lent.**

AT MATINS

****

After the Dismissal of the Midnight Office the Priest, having made the customary metania to the Superior, or to his stall, enters the sanctuary and makes three bows before the holy Table. He puts on the Epitrachelion and, standing in front of the holy Table, intones:

Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

Reader:

Amen. ****

The Priest blesses the incense and begins to cense the sanctuary and the whole church as usual.

The Reader begins:

Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us (

**three times**)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your name’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen

Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed; your kingdom come; your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

****

Priest:

For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen.

Lord, have mercy (

**x12**). Glory. Both now.

Come, let us worship and fall down before the King, our God.
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ the King, our God.
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King, our God.

****

With three metanias; then the following two psalms.

Psalm 19

May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob shield you. May he send you his help from the holy place, and support you from Sion. May he remember your every sacrifice, and accept with favour your whole burnt offering. May the Lord give you your heart’s desire, and fulfil your every purpose. We shall rejoice in your salvation, and be magnified in the name of our the Lord our God. May the Lord fulfil all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ. He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty acts is the salvation of his right hand. Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will call on the name of the Lord our God. They were fettered and fell, but we have risen and been set upright. Lord, save the king, and hear us on the day we call upon you. ****

Psalm 20

The king will rejoice in your power, O Lord, he will exult exceedingly in your salvation. You gave him his heart’s desire; you did not deny him the request of his lips. For you came to meet him with blessings of goodness; you placed a crown of precious stones upon his head. He asked you for life, and you gave him length of days for age on age. Great is his glory because of your salvation; you will place on him glory and majesty. For you will give him blessing for age on age, and make him glad with the joy of your countenance. For the king puts his hope in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Most High he will not be shaken. May your hand light upon all your enemies, and your right hand find out all who hate you. You will make them like a blazing oven at the time of your presence. The Lord will confound them in his wrath and fire will devour them. You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their seed from among the children of humankind. Because they intended evils against you, and devised plans by which they can in no way succeed. For you will put them to flight; among your remnants you will prepare their presence. Be exalted, Lord, in your power; we will sing and praise your mighty acts.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us (

**three times**)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your name’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen

Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed; your kingdom come; your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

****

Priest:

For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

The priest must take care that he is standing beneath the Polyeleos to say this conclusion. He then enters the sanctuary, puts away the censer and takes his stand in front of the Holy Table.

Reader:

Amen. ****

And the following Troparia:

Lord, save your people, and bless your inheritance, granting your faithful people victory over their enemies, and guarding your commonwealth by your Cross.

Glory.

Lifted up on the Cross of your own will, grant you mercies, Christ God, to the new commonwealth called by your name. Make your faithful people glad by your power, giving them victory over their enemies. May they have your help in battle, a weapon of peace, an invincible trophy.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Dread Champion that cannot be put to shame, do not despise our petitions, O Good One. All-praised Mother of God establish the commonwealth of the Orthodox, save your people and give them victory from heaven, for you gave birth to God, O only blessed one.

****

Priest:

Have mercy on us, O God, according to your great mercy. We pray you, hear and have mercy. ****

Reader:

Lord have mercy (**x3**). ****

Priest:

For you, O God, are merciful, and love humankind, and to you we give glory, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. In the name of the Lord, give the blessing, Father. ****

Priest:

Glory to the holy, consubstantial, life-giving and undivided Trinity, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen.

THE SIX PSALMS

****

And we begin the Six Psalms, listening with complete silence and compunction. The Superior, or the designated reader, with devotion and fear of God says:

Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth, goodwill among men (

**x3**).

Lord, you will open my lips: and my mouth will declare your praise (

**x2**). ****

Psalm 3

Lord, why have those who afflict me been multiplied? Many rise against me. Many say to my soul, ‘There is no salvation for him in his God’. But you, Lord, are my helper, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. With my voice, I cried to the Lord, and he heard me from his holy mountain. I lay down and slept; I awoke, because the Lord will assist me. I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who surround me. Rise, Lord, save me, my God; because you have struck all who are vainly my foes. You have smashed the teeth of sinners. Salvation is the Lord’s, and your blessing is upon your people. ****

And again:

I lay down and slept; I awoke because the Lord will assist me.

****

Psalm 37

Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chastise me in your wrath. For your arrows have been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a heavy hand upon me. There is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in my bones on account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my head; like a heavy burden they weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank and festered on account of my foolishness. I was wretched and utterly bowed down; I went about mourning all day long. For my loins were filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated exceedingly; I howled from the groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning was not hidden from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and even the light of my eyes had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and stood against me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life used force, and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and meditated trickeries all day long. But I, like a deaf man, heard nothing; like one who is dumb, who does not open his mouth. So I became like one who cannot hear, and in whose mouth there are no rebukes. For in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will answer me, O Lord my God. For I said: Let my foes never exult over me. When my foot slipped they crowed over me. For I am ready for blows and my pain is with me continually. For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my sin. But my enemies live and have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly have been multiplied. Those who repay me with evils in place of good have slandered me, since I pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not go far from me. Hasten to help me, Lord of my salvation. ****

And again.

Do not forsake me, Lord; my God do not go far from me.
Hasten to help me, Lord of my salvation.

****

Psalm 62

O God, my God, I watch for you at dawn; my soul has thirsted for you, my flesh how often in a desert, untrodden and waterless land. Thus I appeared before you in the holy place, to see your power and your glory. For your mercy is better than life; my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands. May my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; my mouth will praise you with joyful lips. When I remembered you upon my bed, every dawn I meditated upon you. For you became my helper, and in the shelter of your wings I shall rejoice. My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld me. But those who vainly sought my life will go down to the deepest parts of the earth, they will be delivered to the power of the sword, they will be portions for foxes. But the king will rejoice in God, and all who swear by him will be praised; for the mouths of those who speak iniquities have been stopped. ****

And again.

Every dawn I meditated upon you, for you became my helper, and in the shelter of your wings I shall rejoice.
My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld me.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit. Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God (

**x3, without Metanias**). Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit. Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Psalm 87

Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day, and by night also before you. Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to my supplication. For my soul was filled with evils, and my life drew near to Hell. I was reckoned among those that go down to the Pit; I became as one that has no help, free among the dead. Like the slain that sleep in the tomb, whom you remembered no more; and they were cut off from your power. They placed me in the lowest Pit; in darkness and in the shadow of death. Your wrath lay heavy upon me, and you brought all your waves against me. You put my friends far from me, and made me an abomination to them. I was handed over and I came out; my eyes grew weak because of my beggary. I cried to you, Lord, all the day; I stretched out my hands towards you. Will you work wonders for the dead; or will physicians raise them up again to praise you? Will any declare your mercy in the tomb, or your truth in the place of destruction? Will your wonders be known in the dark, or your justice in a land that has been forgotten? But to you, Lord, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer will come before you. Why have you rejected my soul, Lord; why do you turn away your face from me? I am poor and in toils since my youth; exalted, I was humbled and brought to despair. Your fierce anger overwhelmed me, and your terrors appalled me. They surrounded me like water all day long; they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour you have put far from me, and my companions because of my misery. ****

And again.

Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day; and by night also before you.
Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn your ear to my supplication.

****

The priest comes from the Altar and reads the morning prayers quietly.

Psalm 102

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of his benefits. He forgives all your iniquities; he heals all your diseases; he redeems your life from corruption and crowns you with mercy and compassion; he satisfies your desire with good things; your youth will be renewed like an eagle’s. The Lord performs deeds of mercy and judgement for all who are oppressed. He made known his ways to Moses, his wishes to the children of Israel. The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy. He will not always be wrathful, nor will he be enraged for ever. He has not dealt with us according to our iniquities, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For, like the height of heaven above the earth, the Lord has made his mercy prevail over those that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he taken our sins from us. As a father takes pity on his children the Lord has taken pity on those who fear him. For he knows of what we are made; has remembered that we are but dust. As for man, his days are but as grass, he will blossom like a flower of the field; for when a wind has passed over it, it will be no more and will know its place no longer. But the mercy of the Lord is for ever and ever upon those who fear him; and his justice upon their children’s children, upon those who keep his covenant and remember his commandments to do them. The Lord has prepared his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Bless the Lord, all you his Angels, powerful in strength, who perform his word, and listen to the voice of his words. Bless the Lord, all you his Powers, his Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord, all you his works. In every place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul! ****

And again.

In every place of his dominion: bless the Lord, O my soul!

****

Psalm 142

Lord, hear my prayer: in your truth give ear to my supplication, and in your justice hear me. Do not enter into judgement with your servant: for in your sight no one living can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul, humbled my life to the ground. Made me dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit grew despondent within me and my heart within me was troubled. I remembered days of old, I meditated on all your works: I made the works of your hands my meditation. I stretched out my hands towards you: my soul thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord, my spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I should walk, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord: I have run to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land. For your name’s sake, O Lord, you will give me life. In your justice, you will bring my soul out of trouble, in your mercy slay my enemies, and destroy all those that afflict my soul, for I am your servant. ****

And again.

In your justice hear me, O Lord, and do not enter into judgement with your servant. (

**x2**)
Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit.

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

Amen. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God (

**x3**). **Metanias** (**x3**) ****

Then the Litany by the Priest, outside the Sanctuary.

In peace, let us pray to the Lord.

****

People:

Lord, have mercy. **And so after each petition.**

For the peace from on high and for the salvation of our souls, let us pray to the Lord.
For the peace of the whole world, for the welfare of the holy Churches of God, and for the union of all, let us pray to the Lord.

\[For our Sovereign Lady, Queen Elizabeth, the Royal Family, her Government, and all in authority, let us pray to the Lord.

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

Priest:

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

People:

Amen. ****

We sing

Alleluia **3 times in the 8th Tone, saying first one of the following verses.**

Verse 1

. From nightfall my spirit is awake for you, O God, for your commands are light upon the earth. ****

Verse 2.

Learn justice, inhabitants of the earth. ****

Verse 3.

Jealousy will seize an untaught people, and now fire devours their adversaries. ****

Verse 4.

Bring evils upon them, O Lord, bring evils upon them, the glorious ones of the earth. ****

Then the following Troparion is sung solemnly 3 times.

Tone 8

Behold, the Bridegroom comes in the middle of the night, and blessed is that servant whom he finds watching; but unworthy is the one whom he finds slothful. Take care then, my soul, not to be overcome with sleep, lest you be given up to death, and be shut out of the kingdom; but rouse yourself and cry: Holy, holy, holy are you, O God; through the prayers of the Foreunner, have mercy on us.

Glory.

Both now.

Take care then, my soul, not to be overcome with sleep, lest you be given up to death, and be shut out of the kingdom; but rouse yourself and cry: Holy, holy, holy are you, O God; through the Mother of God, have mercy on us.

\[

**According to the Russian Typikon the ending is the same each time:** through the Mother of God have mercy on us. **The modern Greek books place a small Litany here, with the ekphonesis,** For yours is the might…\] ****

Then we recite Kathisma 9 of the Psalter \[Psalms 64-69\]. After the Psalter the following Kathisma

\[**by St Romanos the Melodist**\]**:**

Tone 4. Lifted up on the Cross.

Let us love the Bridegroom, brethren, let us, radiant with virtues and right faith, trim our lamps, that ready, like the Lord’s prudent virgins, we may enter the marriage feast with him; for the Bridegroom, as God, grants a gift to all: the incorruptible crown.

Glory. Both now.

****

Then Kathisma 10 of the Psalter \[Psalms 70-76\] is read and after it the following Kathisma in the same Tone.

Tone 4. Joseph was amazed.

Priests and scribes with envy wickedly assembled a lawless council against you, O Saviour, and moved Judas to betrayal; therefore he went out shamelessly; spoke against you to the lawless peoples, ‘What will you give me, he says, and I will betray him into your hands?’ From his condemnation, Lord, deliver our souls.

Glory. Both now.

****

Then Kathisma 11 of the Psalter is read \[Psalms 77-84\], and after it the following Kathisma:

Tone 8. The Wisdom and Word.

Impious Judas with avaricious intent is moved against the Teacher, he plots, he meditates betrayal. He falls from light, receiving darkness; he agrees the sale; he sells the One beyond price. And so the wretch finds a noose as the reward for what he did and an agonising death. Rescue us from his fate, Christ our God, granting forgiveness of offences to us who celebrate with love your spotless passion.

\[

**The Russian Typikon prescribes three readings, one after each Kathisma, from St John Chrysostom’s commentary on St Matthew’s Gospel, without specifying the references precisely.**\] ****

And at once the Priest says:

And that he would count us worthy to listen to the holy Gospel, let us pray to the Lord God.

****

Reader:

Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy. ****

Priest:

Wisdom. Stand upright. Let us listen to the holy Gospel. Peace to all. ****

Reader:

And to your Spirit. ****

Priest:

The reading is from the holy Gospel according to Matthew. ****

Reader:

Glory to you, Lord, glory to you! ****

Priest:

Let us attend.

\[

**22:15-23:39**\]

At that time, the Pharisees took counsel against Jesus and plotted to entrap him in what he said. So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, ‘Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, and show deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?’ But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, ‘Why are you putting me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin used for the tax.’ And they brought him a denarius. Then he said to them, ‘Whose image is this, and whose title?’ They answered, ‘Caesar’s.’ Then he said to them, ‘Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.’ When they heard this, they were amazed; and they left him and went away. The same day some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him; and they asked him a question, saying, ‘Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies childless, his brother shall marry the widow, and raise up children for his brother.’ Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married, and died childless, leaving the widow to his brother. The second did the same, so also the third, down to the seventh. Last of all, the woman herself died. In the resurrection, then, whose wife of the seven will she be? For all of them had married her.’ Jesus answered them, ‘You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? God is not God of the dead, but of the living.’ And when the crowd heard it, they were astounded at his teaching. When the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together, and one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. ‘Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?’ He said to him, ‘‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And a second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’ On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.’ Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them this question, ‘What do you think of Christ? Whose son is he?’ They said to him, ‘David’s.’ He said to them, ‘How is it then that David by the Spirit calls him Lord, saying, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, ‘Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet’ ‘? If David then calls him Lord, how can he be his son?’ No one was able to give him an answer, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions. Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, ‘The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat; therefore, whatever they teach you to observe, observe and do it; but do not do as they do, for they speak and do not do it. They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on the shoulders of others; but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them. They do all their works to be seen by others; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long. They love to have the place of honour at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues, and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and to have people call them rabbi. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, Christ, and you are all brothers. And call no one your father on earth, for you have one Father — the one in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one instructor, Christ. The greatest among you will be your servant. All who exalt themselves will be humbled, and all who humble themselves will be exalted. But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the houses of widows and, as a pretext, recite long prayers. Because of this you will receive a more severe condemnation. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. For you do not go in yourselves, and when others are going in, you stop them. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cross sea and land to make a single convert, and you make the new convert twice as much a child of hell as yourselves. Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple is bound by nothing, but whoever swears by the gold of the sanctuary is bound by the oath.’ Blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold? ‘Whoever swears by the altar is bound by nothing, but whoever swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound by the oath.’ Blind fools! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift? So whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it; and whoever swears by the temple, swears by it and by the one who dwells in it; and whoever swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by the one who is seated upon it. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. It is these you ought to have practised without neglecting the others. Blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel! Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of greed and injustice. You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup, so that the outside also may become clean. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of the bones of the dead and of all kinds of filth. So you also on the outside appear righteous to others, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the graves of the righteous, and you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’ Thus you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of your ancestors. You snakes, you brood of vipers! How can you escape being sentenced to hell? Therefore I send you prophets, sages, and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town, so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zachary son of Barachias, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. Amen, I say to you, all this will come upon this generation. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! See, your house is left to you, desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’ ‘

Reader:

And at once:
Psalm 50

Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with your great mercy. According to the multitude of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you alone I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words and win when you are judged. For see, in wickedness I was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your salvation, and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it. You will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer calves upon your altar. ****

Priest:

Again and again in peace, let us pray to the Lord. ****

Reader:

Lord, have mercy. ****

Help us, save us, have mercy on us and keep us, O God, by your grace. ****

Priest:

For you are the King of peace and the Saviour of our souls, and to you we give glory, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and for ever and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. ****

After the small litany the Kontakion
Tone 2

Think, miserable soul, on the hour of the end, and made fearful by the cutting down of the fig tree, work with love of toil at the talent given you, as you watch and cry: May we not be left outside Christ’s bridal chamber!

****

The Ikos

Why are you slothful, my wretched soul? Why dwell unseasonably on senseless cares? Why busy yourself with what is passing? The last hour is at hand, and we shall soon be parted from what is here. While you still have time, come to your senses and cry out, ‘I have sinned against you, my Saviour; do not cut me off like the unfruitful fig tree, but as you are compassionate, O Christ, take pity on a soul that cries out in fear: May we not be left outside Christ’s bridal chamber!’

****

The Menologion of the day and then the following notice:

On holy and great Tuesday we commemorate the parable of the ten virgins from the sacred Gospel.

****

Verses

Great Tuesday now bears with it virgins ten,
Who bear the triumph of the Master just.

But, O Bridegroom Christ, number us with the prudent virgins, range us with the chosen flock and have mercy on us. Amen

****

We begin the Canon by St Kosmas, of which the Acrostic is:

And On Tuesday

****

In each Ode the Irmos is sung twice and the troparia repeated to make 12. The Irmos is repeated as Katavasia.

Ode 8. Tone 2. Irmos.

‘The three holy Youths, did not obey the tyrant’s decree and cast into the furnace confessed God, as they sang: You works of the Lord, bless the Lord!’

****

Troparia

Let us cast sloth far from us, and with shining lamps let us meet Christ the immortal Bridegroom with hymns, as we cry: Bless the Lord his works.

May the oil of fellowship in the vessels of our soul be sufficient, that not having spent the moment of the prize in commerce we may sing: You works of the Lord, bless the Lord!

You that have all received the talent?grace of equal power from God?, increase it with the help of Christ who gave it, as you sing: You works of the Lord, bless the Lord!

****

Katavasia

The three holy Youths, did not obey the tyrant’s decree and, cast into the furnace, they confessed God as they sang: You works of the Lord, bless the Lord!

****

The Magnificat is not sung, but instead the 9th Ode.

Ode 9. The Irmos.

‘All-holy Virgin, who contained in your womb the uncontainable God and bore joy for the world, we sing your praise.’

****

Troparia

O Good One, you said to your disciples, ‘Watch! For at the hour you do not know, the Lord will come to reward each one’.

At your dread second coming, Master, range me with the sheep on your right hand, overlooking the multitude of my offences.

****

Katavasia

All-holy Virgin, who contained in your womb the uncontainable God and bore joy for the world, we sing your praise.

How shall I, the unworthy, enter among the splendours of your saints? For if with them I dare to enter the bridal chamber, my tunic accuses me, because it is not a wedding garment, and I shall be cast out bound by the angels. Lord, cleanse the filth of my soul, and save me as you love humankind.

Tone 2.

Slumbering in sloth of soul, O Bridegroom Christ, I have not obtained a lamp burning with virtues, and I have become like the foolish maidens, wandering about at the moment for action.

Soul, having heard the condemnation of the one who hid his talent, do not hide God’s word. Proclaim his wonders, that multiplying the gift of grace you may enter the joy of your Lord.

Then the Superior says:

To you glory is due, O Lord, our God, and to you we give glory, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and for ever and to ages of ages. Amen.

Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill among men. We praise you, we bless you, we worship you, we glorify you, we thank you for your great glory. O Lord, heavenly King, God the almighty Father. O Lord, only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Lord God, lamb of God, Son of the Father, who takes away the sin of the world, have mercy upon us, who takes away the sins of the world. Receive our prayer, you who sit on the right hand of the Father and have mercy upon us. For you alone are holy, you alone are Lord, Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the Father. Amen.

Every day I will bless you, and praise your name for ever and ever. I said, Lord, have mercy upon me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against you. Lord, I have run to you for refuge; teach me to do your will for you are my God. For with you is the source of life, and in your light we shall see light. O continue your merciful kindness toward those who know you.

Grant, Lord, this day to keep us without sin. Blessed are you, Lord, the God of our fathers, and praised and glorified is your name for to the ages. Amen. May your mercy, Lord, be upon us, as we have hoped in you. Blessed are you, Lord, teach me your statutes. Blessed are you, Master, make me understand your statutes. Blessed are you, Holy One, enlighten me with your statutes. Lord, your mercy is for ever; do not scorn the work of your hands. To you praise is due, to you song is due, to you glory is due, to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Priest:

Let us complete our morning prayer to the Lord. ****

Reader:

Lord, have mercy.

That we may live out the rest of our days in peace and repentance, let us ask of the Lord.
A Christian end to our life, painless, unashamed and peaceful, and a good defence before the dread judgement seat of Christ, let us ask.

To you, O Lord. ****

Priest:

For yours it is to show mercy and to save us, O our God, and to you we give glory, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. ****

After the Litany and the Prayer at the Bowing of heads,
the Aposticha:
Tone 6

Come, believers, let us work eagerly for the Master; for he gives his servants wealth. Let each of us, according to their measure, multiply the talent of grace; let one bring wisdom through good deeds; another perform the ministry of splendour; let a believer share the word with the uninitiated; and another distribute his wealth to the poor. So let us make the loan increase, and, as faithful stewards of grace, become worthy of the Master’s joy. Make us worthy of this joy, Christ our God, as you love humankind.

****

Verse 1.

We were filled in the morning with your mercy, O Lord, and we rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad, for all the days you have afflicted us, for the years we have suffered adversity. Look upon your servants and your works, and guide their children.

When you come in glory with the angelic Powers and take your seat, O Jesu, on the throne of judgement, do not separate me from you, good Shepherd; for you know the right hand ways, while those on the left are twisted. So do not destroy me, hardened in sin, with the goats, but, numbering me with the sheep on the right, save me, as you love humankind.

****

Verse 2.

And may the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us. Direct the work of our hands, O direct the work of our hands.

Bridegroom, lovelier in beauty beyond all humankind, who have invited us to the spiritual banquet of your bridal chamber, by participation in your sufferings strip my ill-clad form of faults, and adorning me with the robe of glory of your beauty, show me to be a radiant guest of your kingdom, as you are compassionate.

Glory. Both now.

**Tone 7.**

See, my soul, the Master entrusts you with a talent. Accept it with fear, gain interest for the giver by distributing it to beggars, and gain the Lord as friend, so that you may stand on his right hand when he comes in glory, and hear his blessed voice, ‘Enter, my servant, into the joy of your Lord’. Make me, who have gone astray, worthy of this, O Saviour, because of your great mercy.

****

Then the Superior says:

How good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praises to your name, O Most High. To declare your love in the morning, and your truth every night.

****

Reader:

Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us (**three times**).

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your name’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen

Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed, your kingdom come; your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors, and do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

****

Priest:

For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. ****

After the

Our Father**, we say the following Apolytikion:**

Standing in the temple of your glory, we think we stand in heaven, O Mother of God. O gate of heaven, open to us the door of your mercy.

\[

**The modern Greek books replace this with the Kontakion of the day:** Think, miserable soul, on the hour of the end, and made fearful by the cutting down of the fig tree, work with love of toil at the talent given you, as you watch and cry: May we not be left outside Christ’s bridal chamber!\] ****

Then

Lord have mercy (**x40**). Greater in honour than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word, truly the Mother of God we magnify you. In the name of the Lord, bless, Father. ****

Priest:

Blessed be He Who Is, Christ our true God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. ****

The Superior:

Heavenly King, establish our rulers: strengthen the faith: calm the nations: make the world peaceful: guard well this holy church \[monastery\]: assign our fathers and brothers who have gone before us to the tents of the just, and accept us in repentance and confession, as you are good and love humankind. ****

Then the prayer of St Ephrem with 4 full and 12 small metanias

Lord and Master of my life, do not give me a spirit of sloth, idle curiosity, love of power and useless chatter. (

**Prostration**)

Rather accord to me, your servant, a spirit of chastity, humility, patience and love. (

**Prostration**)

Yes, Lord and King, grant me to see my own faults, and not to condemn my brother; for you are blessed to the ages of ages. Amen. (

**Prostration**) ****

We then make 12 small metanias, then one further great metania as we repeat the last line of the prayer.

Then at once

Come let us worship**, and the First Hour, during which we do not add a Kathisma of the Psalter, nor at the Ninth Hour.**
