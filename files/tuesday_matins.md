**After the 1st Reading from the Psalter, Kathismata of Compunction.**

**Tone 2.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">My soul, when you think on the examination of that dread day, tremble at the reward of eternal punishment, and with tears cry out in repentance, ‘O God, I have sinned, have mercy on me!’</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua; color: red">Verse:</span>*<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua"> </span>*<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger; nor chastise me in your wrath.<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"></span></span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">As I search my condemned conscience, I quail before your dread assize, Lord, because there is no salvation from my works. But as you have a wealth of compassion, take pity on me, Christ God, and save me.</span>

<span style="color:windowtext">Glory. Both now. </span>**Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">We magnify you, Mother of God, as we cry: Hail, rod from which God sprang without seed and abolished death by a Tree.</span>

**After the 2nd reading, Kathismata of Compunction.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua; letter-spacing: -.1pt">Have mercy on me, said David, and I too cry to you, ‘I have sinned, Saviour, wipe away my sins through repentance and have mercy on me.’</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua; color: red">Verse:</span>*<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua"> </span>*<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger; nor chastise me in your wrath.<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt"></span></span>

Have mercy on me, have mercy on me, lamented David for two sins; for ten thousand offences I cry to you, ‘He watered his couch with tears, while I have not found one drop; I despair and entreat, have mercy on me, O God, according to your great mercy.’

<span style="color:windowtext">Glory. Both now.</span> **Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Mother of God, do not despise as I entreat help from you; for on you has my soul hoped, have mercy on me.</span>

**After the 3rd reading, Kathismata.
As you are source of compassion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">You plunged in Jordan’s streams, John, the ungrudging Source of compassion; therefore I implore you insistently, by your acceptable prayers lead me, who with many passions am being fearfully drowned each day by the ocean of life, to the harbour of life.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">**Verse:**</span> God is wonderful in his Saints, the God of Israel.</span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Christ God, who made your Saints more radiant than gold, and glorified your Holy Ones as you are good, besought by them, pilot our life, as you love mankind, and direct our prayer as incense, you alone rest among the Saints.</span>

<span style="color:windowtext">Glory. Both now. </span>**Theotokion.**

<span style="letter-spacing:
0pt">Who has known, who has heard of Mother giving birth to her own Creator? Without knowing man giving suck to the one who gives food to all flesh? O the wonder! Your womb, Mother of God full of grace, was revealed as the Cherubim throne. Intercede on behalf of our souls.</span>

**Canon of compunction, whose acrostic is:**<span style="color:windowtext">
Grant space to my lamentations, O Saviour. Joseph.<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">“Take up Moses’ song, my soul, and shout, ‘He has become my helper and protector. This is my God, and I will glorify him.’”</span>

**Troparia.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Let us weep bitterly for ourselves, brethren, before our departure, so that with fair tears we may escape tears of punishment, for then they are quite useless.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Ten thousand times, O Christ, I have promised to repent and having an unfeeling soul I fall into offences. Take pity, Saviour, on my weakness.</span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Christ’s Champions, who endured the fire of tortures with God’s refreshing dew, rescue me, subject to dread passions, from the fire of Gehenna.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Flame-bearing tongs, that once Isaias saw, burn up wood the turbid passions of my heart, and make them vanish for ever.</span>

Baptist, accept this supplication. Joseph.</span>

**Irmos. His overwhelming might.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Baptist and Forerunner of Christ, pilot my mind, plunged deep in the pleasures of the body, and calm the waves of the passions, so that in godly calm I may sing your praise.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Shining with ineffable enlightenment, like a star with many light, you ran before the spiritual Dawn. O Baptist, intercede that my heart, darkened by all the assaults of the demons, may be filled with radiance.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">All-wise Baptist, you once plunged in the river the Deep who by grace effects a deluge of every transgression. But, blessed Saint, by your mediation dry up, I beg, the billows of my offences.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Blessed Forerunner, you were the kinsman of the pure Virgin who gave God a body. With her we honour you and we, who now walk within your holy place,<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> implore, ‘Make us houses of the Spirit’.</span>

**Ode 3. The Irmos.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">“O God, husbandman of fair fruits and planter of good things, make my barren mind bring forth fruit.”</span>

**Troparia.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">I have been weighed down in soul by the slumber of idleness. Rouse me, O Christ, to the wakefulness of repentance, to do your commands.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">On the dread day, O Jesu, do not show me to be condemned, but before the end turn me back and deliver me from harsh punishment.</span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Having nobly imitated the sufferings of Christ in godlike ways, Champions of Christ, heal the dread passions of my soul.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">That you might become worthy of everlasting good things in heaven, O Champions, you stoutly endured every trial of torments upon earth.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">As a mother you give suck to the Nourisher of the universe, and you carry in your arms, Pure Virgin, him who at all times carries all things in his hand.</span>

**Of the Forerunner. Another Irmos. On the rock of the faith.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Heal the wounds of my soul, fill my mind, darkened by indifference, with radiance by your godlike mediation, Forerunner of the Lord, and deliver me, I beg, from every hostile circumstance.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Brought to birth by God’s foreknowledge, wise Prophet, you released the one who gave you birth from barrenness. Therefore, Forerunner of the Lord, now make my barren heart fruitful, bearing shoots of virtues.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Baptist and Forerunner, implore that the godly house, constructed for you with love,<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> may attain the inheritance on high. By your mediations make those who serve with faith in your sacred enclosure temples of the divine Spirit.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">The Forerunner, carried in his mother’s womb, rejoices and he worshipped the lord, carried in your womb, O Full of God’s grace. Intercede with him that I may be rescued from every affliction.</span>

**Ode 4. The Irmos.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">“The Prophet, foreseeing your birth from a Virgin, cried out and proclaimed, ‘I heard your report, O Christ, and I was afraid, for you came from Theman and from a holy shaded mountain.’”</span>

**Troparia.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">The hostile trickster, seeing me robbed and beggared on every side, O Word, rejoices at my loss. Lord of glory, who make the needy rich, rescue me from his malice.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">I have defiled my hands and eyes, Lord, by doing what it is not lawful to do, and I have stirred up your pity to rage by squandering your long-suffering. Look upon me, O Good One and take pity.</span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">How wonderful is our God in the saints, who obeyed him and tore down the wooden idols of destruction and inherited the broad space of Paradise, from which Adam was cast out of old.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">With the streams of your blood, blessed Martyrs, you did away with the foul gore that was once offered as a destructive sale to demons, for the ruin of those who brought it. Therefore you are ever blessed.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">The glorious choir of the Prophets, Mother of God, initiated by the Spirit into your mystery beyond understanding, depicted it beforehand in many ways by sacred symbols, whose fulfilment we now clearly see.</span>

**Of the Forerunner. Another Irmos. <span style="mso-font-kerning:10.0pt">From a Virgin you came.</span>**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">You bowed beneath your right hand, all-blessed Saint, the head of him who bowed the heavens and conversed with mortals. Keep me safe by that hand and guard my soul in humility.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">The pathless desert had you as a citizen, blessed Forerunner. Therefore I cry to you, ‘Keep safe my soul, which has become a desert of any godly deed.’</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">For defending God’s law you were lawlessly destroyed. Therefore I implore you, set me to rights, who always transgress the law and am entrapped by the wiles of the demons.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Having built yourself, O Forerunner, as a palace for the Master, you have passed over to tabernacles of God. Implore that he who raised up the all-holy house to you may attain them.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Look upon me, O All-unblemished, in my sickness and abolish my fearful passions that are hard to cure, that I may magnify you who magnified all that is human.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">“Scatter the fog of my soul, my Saviour, and make me radiant with the light of your commandments, for you alone are King of peace.”</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Foolishly I join sins to sins and there is no looking upward in my death. Alas, how shall I appear to Christ?</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Having suffered shipwreck as on a voyage, I have lost the cargo that you gave me, O Compassionate, and now in poverty I cry, ‘Do not despise me, O Christ!’</span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Having despised the well-worn glory here below, O Champions, you were found worthy of heavenly glory, and you are together with Christ.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Having kept your minds by faith away from affinity with the flesh, O Champions, you lovingly made torments your friends being friends with Christ.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Daniel saw you in spirit as a great mountain, Mother of God, from which a stone was cut which reduces the idols of the demons to dust.</span>

**Of the Forerunner. Another Irmos.
The enlightenment of those in darkness.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Forerunner, who in the torrents of Jordan baptized with the streams of incorruption, implore Christ to dry up the surgings of my passions and to make me inherit the flood of delight and the pleasant joy of the Just.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Already I lament and cower with fear and am ever held by despair as I call to mind what I have done and the fearful judgement to come. Compassionate Lord, spare me at the entreaties of your Baptist.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Ordaining that there would be salvation from faults for the peoples by change of heart, O Forerunner, you stood midway between law and grace. Therefore we entreat you, make clear to us ways of repentance.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Give me, who have idly squandered every past opportunity, an opportunity for repentance, O Word, my Benefactor, who have John, the great Forerunner and universal herald of repentance, imploring you for this.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">I have been put to death, all-blameless Lady, by the assaults and ambushes of the deceiver. Give me life, Mother of God, who gave birth to the empersonned Life of all, that I may devoutly sing your praise, O all-blameless.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">“I am held fast by an abyss of sins, O Christ, and am storm-tossed on the sea of life. But as you did Jonas from the beast, bring me up too from the passions, O Saviour, and save me.”</span>

**Troparia.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Like the woman of Canaan of old, I cry out to you, Saviour, ‘Son of God, have mercy on me, take pity! For I have a soul that is suffering grievously and does not of itself wish to come to its senses.’</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">A storm of unmeasured passions tosses me about. As you once rebuked the sea and saved the holy Disciples, bring me up too, O Jesu, and save me, O Christ.</span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">The bodiless choirs of Angels were amazed at your brave endurance in body, honoured Athletes, and they praised the One who granted you power and recompense of toils.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Drenched with the streams of your own blood, your eyes gouged out and frozen by bitter ice, you passed over to the warmth of life, singing the praises of Christ.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Like a table you carry the mystic Bread, O All-praised, eating of which we, who know you to be the Mother of Christ, the God of all, and truly the one who feeds him, are no longer hungry.</span>

Surrounded by an abyss of faults.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Forerunner, implore Jesus, whom you baptized with your hand, to deliver me from the hand of sin as I ever raise my hands to him.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">I am held fast by the slumber of indifference; a sleep of sin weighs down my heart. By your unsleeping mediation, O All-pure, wake me up and save me.</span>

**Ode 7. The Irmos.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">“The Youths in the furnace, imitating the Cherubim, danced and cried out, ‘Blessed are you, O God, for with truth and judgement you have brought all these things upon us because of our sins; you who are highly praised and glorified to all the ages.’”</span>

**Troparia.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">I have set aside your laws, O Christ, I have been subjected to irrational desires, doing things that are not fitting, for in my senselessness I have acted foolishly as no other person on earth. Through your love for mankind, then, Saviour, do not let me perish.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">See, in wickedness I was conceived, Lord, I cry like David, and I weep like the harlot. And like a slave who provokes, I have provoked you, who alone are the good God. Through your love for mankind, then, Saviour, do not let me perish.</span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">The company of the Champions struggled as martyrs, and as martyrs was crowned by the life-bearing right hand, because they truly loved God, who has made all things by a word. And now in heaven with gladness they enjoy the divine inheritance.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Their eyes gouged out, their hands and feet torn off, the glorious Martyrs were swiftly sent upon the way to heaven, tripping up beneath them the ways of the foe. At their prayers, O Word, save all who glorify you.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">The Cherubim glorify, the Seraphim, Thrones, Powers and Dominions praise your giving birth beyond understanding, Mary all-praised, for you alone bore God in the flesh. Implore him, O Pure one, that all of us who honour you with love may be saved.</span>

**Of the Forerunner. Another Irmos.**<span style="mso-font-kerning:10.0pt">**
A godless order.**</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">With your axe of repentance, O Forerunner, pluck out the bruises of my passionate heart and plant in it divine dispassion and a most pure fear of God, making me a stranger to every wickedness.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">As you baptized in the streams of Jordan the Lord who roofs his upper chambers with waters, implore him to grant the water of divine compunction unceasingly to my eyes, glorious Forerunner.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">Glorious Forerunner, who proclaimed the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world, ask him to show me to be a stranger to the fate of the goats and to number me with the sheep on his right hand.</span>

**Troparia.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">That you might make me divine, you became flesh through compassion. But I, wholly enslaved to pleasures, have not understood. In your goodness turn me back, O Christ, the salvation of all.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">You are the good Shepherd, O Word, turn back my wretched soul, that has been led astray on the mountains of transgression, and save me lest the enemy that leads astray finally swallows me down.</span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Book Antiqua">‘Let us stand bravely together’, the joyful Champions cried to one another, as they were being savagely tortured. ‘See Christ is holding out the crowns of victory to all the ages.’</span>
