****

After the 1st reading from the Psalter Kathismata of Compunction.

Visit my humble soul, Lord, that has squandered its whole life in sins; receive me as you did the Harlot and save me.

****

Verse:

Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger; nor chastise me in your wrath.

As I sail the sea of this present life I think on the abyss of my many evils, and as I have no thought as helmsman, I cry aloud to you in Peter’s words. Save me, Christ God, save me as you love mankind!

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Fearful the mystery and marvellous the wonder, how the Virgin bore you the Creator of all things and after childbirth remained still untouched and Virgin. O God, born of her, establish the faith, subdue the nations and give peace to the world, as you love mankind.

****

After the 2nd reading, others.

With haste let us enter the bridal-chamber of Christ together and let us all hear the blessed voice of our God himself. Come, lovers of the heavenly glory, let us become companions of the wise virgins and make our lamps radiant through the faith.

****

Verse:

Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger; nor chastise me in your wrath.

Consider, my soul, how we are to stand before the Judge. In that dread hour fearful thrones are set in place, the deeds of mortals are examined; then the Judge is implacable, for fire runs before the judgement seat, with its roaring like a raging sea, and smothers those who have offended. Consider these things daily, my soul, and set your works to rights.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

As truly and surely Mother of God, who with boldness as a Mother intercede with your Son, protect above all the flock which runs to your protection, takes refuge in you as harbour and wall, the only defence of the human race.

****

After the 3rd reading, others.

O Trinity above all godhead, the choirs of Bodiless Powers unceasingly hymn you with immaterial mouths, and stand before you with fear as they cry: Holy. Three-personned Nature, at their prayers have mercy on that which your own hands have fashioned, only lover of mankind.

****

Verse:

God is wonderful in his Saints, the God of Israel. ****

Of the Martyrs.

To-day the hosts of Angels are present to enlighten the minds of the faithful at the memory of the Champions and to make the whole world bright with grace; besought through them, O God, grant us your great mercy.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion***.*

To the one who was brought up in the Temple, in the Holy of Holies, to the one who was clothed in faith and wisdom and measureless virginity, Gabriel the Chief Captain offered the greeting from heaven and his Hail: Hail, blessed one! Hail, glorified one! The Lord is with you.

****

Canon of Compunction, whose acrostic, without the Theotokia, is

Saviour, save me as you once saved the Prodigal. Joseph.

****

Ode 1. Tone 4. The Irmos.

Mighty captains third in rank, the third part of the soul, drown in a deep of dispassion, I beg, O Born of a Virgin, that as on a timbrel I may by putting the body to death sing you a song of victory.

****

Troparia.

Jesu my Saviour, who saved the Prodigal, accepted once the weeping of the Harlot and by your command justified the Publican when he sighed, accept me as I repent of numberless offences and save me.

The burning pyre of wickedness wastes my soul like kindling, makes me fuel for the flame to come, O Lover of mankind; quench it with the dew of your mercy, O Long-suffering, by granting me tears of repentance.

****

Of the Martyrs.

The choir of holy Athletes, filled with much understanding, soberly turned from the senseless counsel and absurd thinking of all the transgressors of the law and obtained the divine prizes.

Wise, all-praised Champions, you rejected all the pleasures of the world and received a life beyond the world; rescue me then from the passing condition of the world who truly call you blessed.

****

Theotokion.

Supremely radiant lamp of the Sun of glory, set light to the torch of my soul, ever quenched by sloth, soothing it, All-holy, with the oil of godly deeds, that with faith and love I may glorify you.

****

Another Canon, of the Bodiless Powers, whose acrostic is:

A fourth song of the Bodiless Minds.

****

The same Irmos.

As pure Minds who stand before the first, great Mind and are filled with the blaze of the godhead, flood me, all-glorious Angels, with your radiance, who sing the Word, the cause of all.

Ever turned in love towards God and always formed by divine beauty, glorious Archangels, you keep watch in all-harmonious ranks as you shout aloud a hymn of victory to the Creator.

****

Theotokion.

You alone received in your womb the Word, whom hosts of Angels ever glorify; make my soul shine, dispelling the dark malice of sin and enlightening it with the knowledge of the Spirit.

****

Ode 3. The Irmos.

You came down from on high of your own will upon earth, who are above all rule, and exalted humble mortal nature from the lowest Hades; for none is holy but you, O Lover of mankind.

****

Troparia.

In the night of life the darkness of the passions has seized me, Christ God; unsetting Light, flood me then with rays of repentance; save me, Lover of mankind, that I may glorify you.

Declare me, O Christ, to be of the portion of the chosen, separating me O Saviour, from the opposing fate, when I have been cleansed by tears and deeds of mercy, that as is fitting I may always glorify you.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Truly you dyed your feet in your own blood and swiftly walked to heaven, leaving the earth with sin behind, O Martyrs, equals of the divine Powers.

Your twisted bodies were dissolved by tortures, Athletes of Christ, but the sinews of the soul were strengthened, indissolubly bound to the love of the Creator of all things by his will.

****

Theotokion.

Lady Mary, as she who gave birth to the Lord of all, make free my mind, lorded over by the passions and blackened by wickedness, and make it radiant.

****

Of the Angels. Same Irmos.

O Christ the Word, hymned by celestial choirs, make the gatherings of the faithful also devoutly imitate their ranks; for none is holy but you, O Lover of mankind.

With intensity of fervent love closely linked to the first source of all that is desired, you stand as ministers praising in never-silent hymns the one Essence without beginning of the Godhead, godly Archangels.

****

Theotokion.

By bearing in your womb Christ, who crowns all with blessings, pure Mother, you clearly abolished the ancient curse of Eve; for none is help but you, Immaculate.

****

Ode 4. The Irmos.

The One who is seated in glory on the throne of the Godhead, Jesus, the One above all godhead, has come on a light cloud and with his unsullied palm has saved those who cry: Glory, O Christ, to your power!

****

Troparia.

As before a most just Judge I fall down before you, Lord; take pity on me, condemned and sentenced; deliver me from your just verdict, and grant me the place of the elect.

O Christ, Lover of mankind, heal one who has fallen among cruel thieves and lies wounded, pouring on me the wine and oil of repentance and clothing me with a garment of salvation.

****

Of the Martyrs.

By putting off the body, all-praised Martyrs, you put on a garment of salvation from on high, and you stripped naked the one who unclothed the Ancestors, making him a lifeless corpse.

Martyrs, adorned with the knowledge of true religion, you preached the Word of God before the lawless and so shamed the wise and clever in their impiety and put the adversary to death.

****

Theotokion.

Jesus, the abyss of wisdom, came down upon you as a shower, for he had found you as alone pure, O Virgin Mother of God, and he burned up the torrents of sin by divine grace.

****

Of the Angels. Same Irmos.

By unimaginable power, O Word of God beyond being, you brought the heavenly Minds out of non-being, and made them beautiful with your ineffable glory, as they cry: Glory, O Christ, to your power!

The Powers of things above controlled by the reins of the Spirit and aflame with his divine rays, have received as their portion the unchanging ranks as they reverence the one Beginning of all things and the one Godhead.

Your ministering Radiances, counted worthy to contemplate the fair beauty of your face, and receiving reflections from it, cry to you: Glory, O Christ, to your power!

****

Theotokion.

The Queen and Virgin, lovely in a golden robe, now stands beside her Son and King, beyond compare more excellent than the Angels who cry: Glory, O Christ, to your power!

****

Ode 5. The Irmos.

Now I shall arise, said God in prophecy, now I shall be glorified, now I shall be exalted by assuming from the Virgin the one that fell and lifting him up towards the wondrous light of my Godhead.

Ah, how guilty, I am now about to take my stand before you, Judge of all and God, and to be convicted for all the dreadful deeds by which, in folly, I have willingly offended, and made myself utterly unprofitable.

Save me, Lord, for I have been filled with many evils; Master, heal my sins and my dread sores, and do not let me perish who have much offended you alone, my Jesu.

****

Of the Martyrs.

A blessed end have the Athletes clearly found; they have obtained glory, having with their own limbs glorified Christ, the judge of the contest, by bravely choosing to engage with torments and with tortures.

Godly Athletes, full of all praise you inherit heavenly bliss, a garland that does not wither, light that knows no evening, a dwelling that does not grow old at all, not built with hands, O all-praised Martyrs of Christ.

****

Theotokion.

Prophetic voices spoke of your wonders, O Immaculate, calling you Mountain, and Gate and Shining Lamp, from which the truly wondrous light, O Pure One, is a beacon fire for the whole world.

****

Of the Angels. Same Irmos.

Trembling the Cherubim and Seraphim, Thrones, Archangels, Dominations, Principalities and Powers with Angels glorify the honour of the one and triple Godhead.

Angels radiant with forms of light appeared, O Christ, proclaiming your Resurrection to the holy women and shaking the mind of your foes with the blaze of your Godhead.

****

Theotokion.

Now wall your Church about with ramparts of Archangels, your Church which glorifies with voices of orthodoxy you the One born ineffably of a Virgin and who delivered mortals from corruption.

****

Ode 6. The Irmos.

I entered the depths of the sea, and a storm of many sins drowned me; but as God lead my life back from corruption, as you love mankind.

****

Troparia.

As I am a corpse, I do not understand, wretch that I am, without feeling and ever bearing a sullied conscience. O God, who fashioned me, do not finally destroy me.

My deeds, O Compassionate One, are going to accuse me like public executioners; swiftly deliver me from them, O Christ, by guiding me to repentance.

****

Of the Martyrs.

A lawless people crushed the bones of the Champions, but did not break their faith, through which they appeared as heirs of God, the Saviour of our souls.

Like precious stones the Champions were built on a rock of unbreakable hope, and like Temples of the Holy Spirit they dwelt in the temple of God.

****

Theotokion.

O Bride of God, shine on my heart, blackened by the dark inroads of sin with the enlightenment which is in you, who bore the Sun.

****

Of the Angels. The same Irmos.

Angelic hosts, who stand around the Master and enjoy undimmed the radiance of the source of light, make bright those who sing your praise with faith.

By your wisdom you created the Angelic choirs, Dominations, Powers and as Master you revealed the Seraphim who eternally honour you.

****

Theotokion.

As the One who takes his rest upon uplifted Thrones, O Christ, and with divine providence observes the universe, you took your rest, Master, in the arms of the Virgin.

****

Ode 7. The Irmos.

Three Youths in Babylon held the tyrant’s command as idle chatter, and in the midst of the fire they cried aloud: Blessed are you, the God of our fathers.

****

Troparia.

To what shall I liken you, alas, my wretched soul, who love foul things and do not seek the good? And so before the end hasten to show proof of good ways.

Give me showers of tears, O Christ, that I may weep over my wicked deeds; and do not allow me now to perish, Saviour, who have offended you greatly more than all.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Bearing in your flesh the death of the Word, who was put to death, you put error to death. Having died you live in glory and cure those put to death by passions, O Athletes.

What place is there now, glorious Martyrs, which does not have you as guides to light and towers of defence? What country does not shine with your struggles and the sunrise of your healings?

****

Theotokion.

You alone, Sovereign Lady, remain after childbirth radiant in the beauty of virginity You alone escaped the pangs of mothers; for you alone bore God, the Redeemer of our souls.

****

Of the Angels. The same Irmos.

With the spiritual Angels as witnesses of our deeds, let us be drawn to lead pure lives as we cry out: Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers.

Cleansed by a coal the godly Isaias sees the Seraphim standing around your throne and cries: Blessed are You, O Lord, the God of our fathers.

****

Theotokion.

As she who bore the maker and Lord of all, you clearly surpass the ranks of Bodiless Powers, All-pure Virgin. Blessed is the fruit of your womb!

****

Ode 8. The Irmos.

Almighty Redeemer of the universe, in your condescension you bedewed the devout Youths in the midst of the flame, and taught them to sing: All you his works, bless, praise the Lord.

****

Troparia.

I have made myself like the beasts, submitting to the passions of irrational beings, O Word of God before all eternity; turn me back and save me as I cry: Bless, praise the Lord!

A destructive solitary wild boar has destroyed me, Saviour, like a vine cultivated by passions; deliver me from it swiftly, and make my soul fruitful with virtues.

****

Of the Martyrs.

The dyes of blood have coloured for you a purple cloak woven by God; wearing it, O Martyrs crowned with victories, you stand before the eternal King in the highest.

The sacred register of the Martyrs has destroyed the band which ordered them to break God\`s law; and having lawfully competed, lawfully they have been garlanded before the Master of all.

****

Theotokion.

All creation blesses your Offspring, who crowned you with blessings, and banished the curse, All-blessed One, alone glorified and who made our race gracious.

****

Of the Angels. Same Irmos.

As you are immortal life you created those who share immortal life and teach them to sing: All you works, bless, praise the Lord.

Archangels surround you in spirit, crying with unceasing voices, giving honour as befits God and crying aloud to the Master of all things: Bless, praise the Lord!

****

Theotokion.

Images in the Law prefigured you, All-blessed, who would give birth to God united to the matter of flesh and who before was immaterial in his divine nature. O Virgin, we bless your Offspring.

****

Ode 9. The Irmos.

Eve by the sickness of disobedience gave entrance to the curse; but you, Virgin Mother of God, by the offshoot of your child-bearing made blessing flower for the world; therefore we all magnify you.

****

Troparia.

See, it is the time of repentance, why do we delay? Why are we sunk in sleep? Let us drag ourselves from sloth; let us trim our lamps, as it is written, with the oil of doing good, lest we stay outside the door lamenting.

As it is time to repent turn back, my soul, from the evils you have done in knowledge and in ignorance; and cry out to Him who knows all things: I have sinned, pardon, Master; do not abominate me, the unworthy.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Christ has gathered the Saints who have struggled gloriously from every country and city to places of glory, to honourable repose; and now with gladness they make bright the Church of the first born.

The all-honoured sepulchre of your honoured Martyrs wonderfully made radiant by the signal-fires of the divine Spirit, sends out the brightness of healings, buries the abuse of diseases, O Lord, alone full of mercy.

****

Theotokion.

Bride of God, guide my soul to light with the rays of the Light that was in you; raise me up, who am lying in the pit of destruction, and cast headlong the foes who ever assail my heart and push me towards the passions.

****

Of the Angels. Another Irmos.

Angels, as you hymn Mind, the Begetter and Originator of the Son and Spirit, now be willing to transmit speedily to us the gifts of the divine goodness.

Fairly adorned with the gift and grace of incorruption, godlike Archangels, as they sing your praise, O Christ, the ever-flowing source of incorruption, as Benefactor they magnify you.

****

Theotokion.

We faithful know you, Mother of God, to be the bridal chamber of the ineffable incarnation, living marriage chamber and Ark of the law of grace; and so unceasingly we magnify you.

****

Aposticha of Lauds.
Of Compunction.

I am a sheep of your rational flock, and I flee to you, the Good Shepherd; seek me out who have been led astray, O God, and have mercy on me.

Wash me with my tears, O Saviour, for I have been befouled by many sins; therefore I fall before you: I have sinned, have mercy on me, O God.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Who is not amazed, holy Martyrs, on seeing the good fight that you have fought? How while still in the body you wounded the bodiless foe, confessing Christ and armed with the Cross. Therefore you have been declared as routers of demons and enemies of barbarians as you intercede unceasingly that our souls may be saved.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Blessed Mother of God, guard your servants from every kind of danger, that we may glorify you, the hope of our souls.

The Beatitudes

Through a tree Adam became an exile from Paradise; but through the Tree of the Cross the Thief made Paradise his home. For the one through tasting set aside his Master’s commandment, while the other, crucified with him, confessed the hidden God, as he cried: Remember me in your Kingdom.

More than all mortals on earth I have offended and I quail at the tribunal in the other world that cannot be deceived. Keep me then uncondemned at it, most loving Lord, rescue me from punishment, giving me repentance that washes me of stains of every kind, as you love mankind.

Cherubim and Seraphim, Virtues, Thrones, Archangels, Dominations together with Powers, holy Angels, most exalted Principalities, as you stand before the Master ask forgiveness of faults and amendment of life for those who cry aloud in faith: Remember us also in your Kingdom.

****

Of the Martyrs

Acquainted with the fire, you burned up the brushwood of error, all-praised Champions of Christ, and with the deluge of your blood you completely drowned the dragon of the deep, and having carried off the victory you rejoice with the armies on high as you intercede insistently on behalf of our souls.

Glory.

Beam of the triple sun that caused the whole cosmos to appear, keep the dread passions far from my soul, send down the dazzling radiance of your light and pardon of faults of one who cries to you, Begetter without beginning, Son equal in throne and Spirit: O Trinity, universally effective power, save us.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Pure Virgin, take pity on me, who am always sinning and am wholly in the grip of sloth and improve by ways of repentance, giving compunction to my hardened soul, O All-pure, the hope that cannot be shamed of those who sing your praise with love and who cry out to Christ: Remember us also in your Kingdom.
