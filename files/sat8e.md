AT GREAT VESPERS
----------------

**After the Opening Psalm and the first Kathisma of the Psalter, at** Lord I have cried, **we insert 10 Stichera, and we sing 7 Resurrection Stichera and 3 of the Saint of the day, or as the Typikon directs.**

Tone 8

We offer you, O Christ, an evening hymn and spiritual worship; because you were well-pleased to have mercy on us through the Resurrection.

Lord, Lord, do not cast us away from your presence; but be well-pleased to have mercy on us through the Resurrection.

Hail holy Sion, Mother of the Churches, dwelling-place of God; for it was you who first received forgiveness of sins through the Resurrection.

****

Other Stichera, by Anatolios

The Word begotten of God the Father before the ages, but in the last times incarnate of her who knew not wedlock, willingly endured the crucifixion of death, and mankind, slain of old, He saved through his own Resurrection.

We glorify your Resurrection from the dead, O Christ, through which You freed Adam’s race from the tyranny of Hades, and as God granted the world eternal life and your great mercy.

Glory to you, Christ Saviour, only-begotten Son of God, nailed to the cross and risen from the tomb on the third day.

We glorify you, Lord, who willingly endured the cross for us, and we worship you, all-powerful Saviour; do not cast us away from your presence, but hearken and save us through your Resurrection, O Lover of mankind.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

The King of heaven through love for mankind appeared on earth and lived among men; for taking flesh from a pure Virgin and coming forth from her with the addition, he is one Son, double in nature, but not in person; therefore proclaiming him as truly perfect God and perfect man, we confess Christ our God; implore him, Mother without bridegroom, to have mercy on our souls.

O Joyful Light, **the Prokeimenon of the day.**

The Lord is King: \* he has robed himself in majesty

Resurrection Aposticha

O Jesu, who came down from heaven, You ascended the Cross; you, immortal Life, came to death; the true Light, to those in darkness; the Resurrection of all to those who had fallen. Our illumination and our Saviour, glory to you.

****

Verse 1:

The Lord is King: he has robed himself in majesty. The Lord has robed and girded himself with power. ****

Alphabetical

Let us glorify Christ who rose from the dead: for having taken a body and a soul, he parted them from one another by the passion; for his soul descended into Hades, whom he despoiled, while the holy body of the Redeemer of our souls did not know corruption in the tomb.

****

Verse 2:

He has made the world firm; it will not be shaken.

We glorify your Resurrection from the dead, O Christ, in psalms and hymns. Through it you have freed us from the tyranny of Hades, and as God granted us eternal life and your great mercy.

****

Verse 3:

Holiness befits your house, O Lord, to length of days.

You, Master of all things, incomprehensible Maker of heaven and earth, by suffering the Cross became for me the source of dispassion. Accepting burial and rising in glory, you raised Adam with you by your all-powerful hand. Glory to your Rising on the third day, through which you have granted us eternal life and forgiveness of sins, as you alone are compassionate.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion**

Virgin without bridegroom, who ineffably conceived God, accept the supplications of your servants, all-spotless Mother of God most high, who grant to all cleansing from faults, now receive our entreaties and beg that we may all be saved.

****

Apolytikion

You came down from on high, O Compassionate, you accepted burial for three days, that you might free us from the passions. Our Life and Resurrection, Lord, glory to you.

****

Theotokion

You were born for us from a Virgin, and endured crucifixion, loving Lord; by your death you despoiled Death, and revealed resurrection as God; do not despise those whom you fashioned with your own hand; show us your compassion, O Merciful; accept the Mother of God who bore you as she intercedes for us, and save, our Saviour, a people in despair.
