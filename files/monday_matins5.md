AT MATINS

****

After the 1st Psalter Reading, Kathismata of Compunction.
Tone 8.

With your compassionate eye, O Lord, see my humiliation, for little by little my life is being squandered, and there is no salvation for me from works; therefore I ask this: with your compassionate eye, Lord, see my humiliation and save me.

****

Verse:

Lord, do not rebuke me your anger; nor chastise me in your rage. ****

The Wisdom and Word.

Reflecting on that dread day, my soul, watch, lighting your lamp and shining with the oil of mercy; for you do not know when the voice will come to you which says: Behold the Bridegroom. See then, my soul, that you do not doze and remain outside knocking like the five virgins; but persevere unsleeping, that you may meet Christ God with rich oil and the he may give you the divine bridal chamber of his glory.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**
**To the same melody.**

The Master and Maker of all things, taking flesh from your immaculate womb, made you guardian of humankind, O All-unblemished; therefore we all take refuge in you, Sovereign Lady, asking forgiveness of offences, and we beg that we may be redeemed from eternal torture and from every punishment in the other world, that with faith we may cry out to you: Intercede with Christ God, O Maiden, that to all who come to your protection in faith may be granted forgiveness.

****

After the 2nd Psalter reading others.

As though the Judge were present, be anxious, my soul, and think on the moment of the dread day; for the judgement is merciless for those who have not acted with mercy; therefore before the end cry out: Spare me, O Saviour, for you alone love humankind.

****

Verse:

Lord, do not rebuke me your anger; nor chastise me in your rage.

As the harlot I fall down before you that I may receive forgiveness, and instead of precious ointment I offer you the tears from my heart, Christ God, that you may take pity on me as on her, O Saviour, and grant me pardon of my sins; for like her I cry to you: Deliver me from the mire of my deeds.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.
Taking knowledge.**

O pure and blessed, filled with God’s grace, together with the Powers on high, the Archangels and all the Bodiless ones, implore without ceasing him who through the compassion of his pity was born from you to grant us before the end amendment, pardon of sins and correction of life, that we may find mercy.

****

After the 3rd reading other Kathismata.
The Wisdom and Word.

Just how long, my soul, will you live in heedlessness? Just how long will spend your time in idleness? Arise from the sleep of idleness, O wretch; when you consider your deeds, groan and shudder at the sentence of the righteous Judge; what defence will you have in that hour? Or how can you be delivered from the burning to come, set as you are in incorrigibility. Cry out before the end to the Judge: Saviour, grant me forgiveness of offences; for you alone are long-suffering.

****

Verse:

God is wonderful in his saints; the God of Israel. ****

Of the Martyrs.

This tabernacle to-day is flooded with heavenly light; for in it the armies of Angels rejoice, and with them the choirs of the Righteous are glad, at the commemoration of the Victors. At their entreaties, O Christ, send down upon your world peace and great mercy.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**
\[**Model melody. By Romanos**\]

Taking knowledge of the secret command, the bodiless Archangel came with haste to Joseph’s dwelling, and said to her who knew not wedlock, ‘He who in his self-abasement bowed the heavens is housed wholly and unchanged in you. As I see him take the form of a servant in your womb I am amazed and cry to you: Hail, Bride without bridegroom!’

****

Ode 1. Tone 8. The Irmos.

Crossing the water as on dry land and fleeing the harsh misery of Egypt, the Israelite cried aloud, ‘To our Redeemer and our God now let us sing!’

****

Troparia.

From Gehenna, which I have gained for myself by my unnatural deeds, deliver me, my Redeemer, and ignite in my mind the blest fire of your love.

I have bowed down, darkened by passions, and condemned by reason, Lord, I am seen to be irrational; make my soul return to her senses, and by the judgements which you know, save me.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Their bodies racked by tortures, the victorious, all-praised Martyrs showed the unflinching rightness of their intent and their love for the Lord.

Many rivers of blood from the bodies of your glorious Champions smothered the thorns of mad idolatry by your power, O Merciful.

****

Lord who constructed heaven’s vault and builder of the Church, establish me in your love, the pinnacle of all desires, the firm foundation of the faithful, only lover of humankind.

****

Troparia.

With what eyes shall I, who have not done one of your commandments on earth, look on you then, Christ Saviour? How shall I take my stand by your unbearable throne to give an account of my measureless wickednesses?

Having opened the arms of your pity, as once you received the Prodigal, receive me, enslaved in like manner to dishonourable passions, and alienated far from you, Jesu, only Lover of humankind and supremely good.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Rooted on the rock of the knowledge of God, Martyrs of Christ and Champions, with the sword of the faith you uprooted the thorns of ignorance and harvested the fruits of your contest.

Now let the Martyrs be praised, the unshakeable towers of the true faith, the far-famed adornments of the Church, the fairest rams of Christ’s flock, willingly sacrificed.

****

Theotokion.

I have gained you as a guard in temptations, O All-holy, I have you as unsleeping protection after God; Oh that may I find you, O All-pure, delivering me from every condemnation on the day of judgement.

****

Revealed, Chief Captains, as Leaders of the angelic host, you are adorned with gifts of many kinds; guard Christ’s Church safely by your protection.

You became the godlike tabernacle of undefiled life, who alone from eternity were revealed as pure, O Virgin Mother; and so, All-blameless, guide me now to life from the shadow of death by your prayers.

Ode 4. The Irmos.

From a shaded mountain, O Word, the Prophet understood that you were to become incarnate of the only Mother of God; and in fear he glorified your power.

Ah how great the struggle of the departed soul, how dread the terror when the Judge takes his seat and those who have sinned are judged. Alas, what shall I do, condemned as I am.

Though my heart is infected with pollutions and I carry the insupportable burden of sins, I have recourse to your pity; do not despise me, but take pity on me, I implore.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Noble Martyrs, your death has been shown to be precious in the sight of God, for though you were encircled by ten thousand pains and tortures you did not deny him.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Godlike Martyrs, the Giver of life has placed you like stones which radiate the knowledge of God, and banish the darkness of error.

To evil laws you opposed the laws of God and preaching God you were eager to be put to death for him.

****

Pure Maiden, slay the movements of my passions, who by your Offspring slew the living sin of the Foremother.

Choirs of honoured Martyrs struggled, wounded a multitude of demons and have been united to the choirs of Angels. At their prayers save us, Lord.

As you now stand around the fearful throne, made worthy, Archangels, to gaze unflinchingly on God, and to be filled with the rays of the Holy Trinity, intercede that those who have recourse to you may be delivered from temptations and passions.

Godlike and all-glorious Archangels, Michael and Gabriel, pray that those who hymn you with songs may attain the friendship of the Master and be mad e worthy of eternal joy and the radiance of God.

Noble Champions, you became dead to the world and in no way did you deny Christ, who dead bears life, as you struggled and chanted, ‘God of our fathers, blessed are you!’

Wise Champions, by confessing one nature of the Trinity in three persons you abolished the deception of idols with its many gods, as you chanted, ‘God of our fathers, blessed are you!’

****

Of the Martyrs.

The noble Champions of the Lord, baptised in streams of blood, were not defiled by any second stain; and therefore crowned as victors, they dance unceasingly among the Angels.

****

Everything that hears trembles at the ineffable condescension of God: how the Most High came down even to take a body and become man of a virgin womb; and so we faithful magnify the immaculate Mother of God.

****

Troparia.

As you purified the Harlot of old through weeping, O Christ; as you justified the Publican when he only sighed, O Word; as you accepted Manasses, as you had mercy on David when he repented, so receive me and save me, only Lover of humankind.

Sigh, weep, my soul; abandon your former failings; openly fall down before him who knows all your secrets, and fervently cry out: I have sinned, Lord, save me, take pity, for you are compassionate and pitying and full of mercy.

****

Of the Martyrs.

The godlike Champions struggled most bravely on earth, and now they have received as inheritance the unshakeable Kingdom, and rejoicing they share the delight of Paradise. At their prayers, O Christ, make us partakers of your glory.

****

Aposticha of Lauds. Of Compunction.

Whenever I call to mind the multitudes of my dreadful deeds, and come to consider that dread examination, overcome with terror I flee to you, the God who loves humankind. And so, do not despise me, only sinless one, grant compunction to my lowly soul before the end and save me.

Give me tears, O God, as you did once to the sinful woman, and grant that with them I may water your feet, which have freed me from the road of error, grant that I may offer you fragrant myrrh: a life made pure for me, that I too may hear your longed-for voice: your faith has saved you, go in peace.

****

Of the Martyrs. Model Melody.

What shall we call you, holy ones? Cherubim, for Christ takes his rest on you. Seraphim, for you ceaselessly glorify him. Angels, for you abandoned the body. Powers, for you perform wonders. your names are many and your graces more. Intercede that our souls may be saved.

Glory. Both now.
