**<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">WEEKDAY VESPERS
FROM THE  OCTOICHOS</span>**

INTRODUCTION
------------

A number of Orthodox Christians like to make daily Vespers their evening prayer and so we hope provide over the next few weeks the texts for Vespers for weekdays in the eight tones from the Octoichos.

On weekdays there are always six stichera at Â‘Lord, I have criedÂ’, of which three are normally taken from the Octoichos and three from the Menaion. In some monasteries two are taken from the first set in the Octoichos and one from the second. If the Menaia are not to hand, the General Menaion may be used, or, if one prefers, all six from the Octoichos, which was probably the older use. If the Saints of the day have their own doxastikon, then the strict Typikon orders all six stichera to be from the Menaion, with the stichera doubled.

On Friday evening the first Theotokion is always that used on the preceding Saturday evening, regardless of the tone of the doxastikon, if there is one.

The Psalm verses for the Aposticha can be found on Sunday, except for those for Friday, which are special.

The phrase which ends many troparia in Greek, literally Â‘the great mercyÂ‘, I translate by Â‘his/your great mercyÂ‘, because it echoes the opening of Psalm 50, which in Greek literally means Â‘the great mercy of youÂ‘; in English, Â‘your great mercyÂ‘.

TONE 1
------

In Tone 1 all the stichera for Â‘Lord , I have criedÂ’ use one of two melodies, Â‘All-praised MartyrsÂ’ and Â‘Joy of the heavenly hostsÂ’. The Â‘AutomelaÂ’, or Â‘modelÂ’ troparia, can be found at the Aposticha; the former on both Wednesday and Friday and the latter on Sunday.  That on Friday occurs, somewhat curiously, among a set of Idiomela. None of the translations of these texts is metrical.

You stretched out your immaculate palms on a Tree, O Christ, and covered your fingers with blood, for you wished, O Lover of humankind, to redeem the work of your hands: Adam who by his transgression was held fast by the kingdom of death and whom you raised by your all-mighty power.

By being nailed to the Cross as man, Christ our God, you made human nature divine; by slaying the serpent you freed us from the curse which came from the tree<a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[11]</span></a>, as you are compassionate becoming a curse<a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[12]</span></a> yourself and granting the world blessing and your great mercy.

All honour being your due in that other world, compassionate Master, you were well-pleased to be dishonoured, undergoing the shameful death on the Tree, through which the human race plucked immortality and regained its former life, when you died in the flesh, O All-powerful.

<span style="color:red;font-style:normal;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Of the Mother of God, to the same melody.</span>

From agonising pain in the feet, paralysis of knees, fracture of limbs and joints, weakness of hands and feet, rescue me, O All Pure, and from the harm that comes from different fluxes, keeping me undefiled by all of these by the love of my God and Fashioner.

Wretch that I am, I bowed down beneath dreadful passions, and I have done wholly profligate deeds of shame, whose base images and fantasies even now batter, confuse and turn me to sensual enjoyment of them in the sensations of my heart. But do you, O Pure one, save me.

My life has become full of many temptations, O All-pure, from the many evils with which I have offended; but ransom me from both and give me both a mind and a life that are without offence and a sober reason, that in faith I may call you blessed and glorify your godly name.

Glory. Both now. <span style="color:red">Theotokion. Same melody.</span>

The Virgin, when she saw your unjust slaughter, O Christ, cried out to you in bitter grief, Â‘My sweetest Child, how are you suffering unjustly? How hanging on the Tree, you that hung the whole earth on the waters? Do not, compassionate Benefactor, leave me alone, your Mother and your servant.

<span style="color:red;font-style:normal;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Aposticha of the Cross.</span>

A Cross was fixed on Calvary and flowered with immortality for us from an inexhaustible spring, the SaviourÂ’s side.

The SaviourÂ’s precious Cross is for us an unbreachable wall; for by trusting in it we are all saved.

<span style="color:red;font-style:normal;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Of the Martyrs.</span>

O the excellence of your deeds, O Saints! For you shed your blood, and inherited heaven; you were tried for a time, and rejoice eternally.

Holy Bride of God, make me holy, sanctified and sober, meek, still, well-ordered, upright and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>devout, true, courageous, prudent, long-suffering, good, fair and measured, blameless, unblemished and without censure, and beyond all these a partaker in Paradise.

Most pure Virgin, I have become fuel for shameless prodigality, an investigator of transgression, a teacher of passions, a guide to lust, entertainer of licentiousness, advocate of intemperance, and I have also taken pleasure in the thought of them. But deliver me from all destruction.

Dread torrents of sin dreadfully buffet me, pains of Hell<a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[29]</span></a> surround me, the spiritual snare of death awaits me. Merciful Lady, I cry out to you with grief in my heart, Â‘Hasten, snatch me now from the death of despair and from the destruction of Hell.**

Your brave confession in the stadium, O Saints, cowed the power of the demons and freed mankind from error; and therefore, as your heads were being struck off, you cried, Â‘May the sacrifice of our lives, Lord, be well-pleasing before you; for longing for you, we despised this temporary life, O Lover of mankindÂ’.

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; letter-spacing: 0pt">How fair your enterprise, O Saints! For you gave your blood and received heaven as your inheritance. You were tested for a time and now rejoice eternally. Truly your trading was fair! For you abandoned things corruptible and received things incorruptible, and now, as you dance with the Angels, you sing without ceasing the praise of the consubstantial Trinity.</span>

<span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Verse:</span> For his Saints who in the land the Lord has worked wonders.

All-praised Martyrs, earth did not hide you, but heaven received you. For you the gates of Paradise stood open, and now within you enjoy the Tree of life. Intercede with Christ that there be granted to our souls his peace and great mercy.

All things are feebler than a shadow; all things are more deceptive than dreams; one instant, and death supplants them all.
