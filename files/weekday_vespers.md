**<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">WEEKDAY VESPERS
FROM THE  OCTOICHOS</span>**

INTRODUCTION
------------

A number of Orthodox Christians like to make daily Vespers their evening prayer and so we hope provide over the next few weeks the texts for Vespers for weekdays in the eight tones from the Octoichos.

On weekdays there are always six stichera at ‘Lord, I have cried’, of which three are normally taken from the Octoichos and three from the Menaion. In some monasteries two are taken from the first set in the Octoichos and one from the second. If the Menaia are not to hand, the General Menaion may be used, or, if one prefers, all six from the Octoichos, which was probably the older use. If the Saints of the day have their own doxastikon, then the strict Typikon orders all six stichera to be from the Menaion, with the stichera doubled.

On Friday evening the first Theotokion is always that used on the preceding Saturday evening, regardless of the tone of the doxastikon, if there is one.

The Psalm verses for the Aposticha can be found on Sunday, except for those for Friday, which are special.

The phrase which ends many troparia in Greek, literally ‘the great mercy‘, I translate by ‘his/your great mercy‘, because it echoes the opening of Psalm 50, which in Greek literally means ‘the great mercy of you‘; in English, ‘your great mercy‘.

TONE 1
------

In Tone 1 all the stichera for ‘Lord , I have cried’ use one of two melodies, ‘All-praised Martyrs’ and ‘Joy of the heavenly hosts’. The ‘Automela’, or ‘model’ troparia, can be found at the Aposticha; the former on both Wednesday and Friday and the latter on Sunday.  That on Friday occurs, somewhat curiously, among a set of Idiomela. None of the translations of these texts is metrical.

Through goodness you brought all things into being, Lord, by your Word and Spirit<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>; then you made me, a rational animal<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>, that I might glorify your holy name, O All-powerful; but instead I ever dishonour it by my shameful deeds: but spare me I beg.

<span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt">Learn, my wretched soul, of God’s kindness and the incorruptible fatherland, and ever hasten to obtain it by good works.

<span style="color:red;font-style:normal;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Tone 1. All-praised Martyrs.</span>

You stretched out your immaculate palms on a Tree, O Christ, and covered your fingers with blood, for you wished, O Lover of humankind, to redeem the work of your hands: Adam who by his transgression was held fast by the kingdom of death and whom you raised by your all-mighty power.

By being nailed to the Cross as man, Christ our God, you made human nature divine; by slaying the serpent you freed us from the curse which came from the tree<a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a>, as you are compassionate becoming a curse<a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a> yourself and granting the world blessing and your great mercy.

All honour being your due in that other world, compassionate Master, you were well-pleased to be dishonoured, undergoing the shameful death on the Tree, through which the human race plucked immortality and regained its former life, when you died in the flesh, O All-powerful.

<span style="color:red;font-style:normal;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Of the Mother of God, to the same melody.</span>

From agonising pain in the feet, paralysis of knees, fracture of limbs and joints, weakness of hands and feet, rescue me, O All Pure, and from the harm that comes from different fluxes, keeping me undefiled by all of these by the love of my God and Fashioner.

Wretch that I am, I bowed down beneath dreadful passions, and I have done wholly profligate deeds of shame, whose base images and fantasies even now batter, confuse and turn me to sensual enjoyment of them in the sensations of my heart. But do you, O Pure one, save me.

My life has become full of many temptations, O All-pure, from the many evils with which I have offended; but ransom me from both and give me both a mind and a life that are without offence and a sober reason, that in faith I may call you blessed and glorify your godly name.

Glory. Both now. <span style="color:red">Theotokion. Same melody.</span>

The Virgin, when she saw your unjust slaughter, O Christ, cried out to you in bitter grief, ‘My sweetest Child, how are you suffering unjustly? How hanging on the Tree, you that hung the whole earth on the waters? Do not, compassionate Benefactor, leave me alone, your Mother and your servant.

<span style="color:red;font-style:normal;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Aposticha of the Cross.</span>

A Cross was fixed on Calvary and flowered with immortality for us from an inexhaustible spring, the Saviour’s side.

The Saviour’s precious Cross is for us an unbreachable wall; for by trusting in it we are all saved.

<span style="color:red;font-style:normal;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Of the Martyrs.</span>

O the excellence of your deeds, O Saints! For you shed your blood, and inherited heaven; you were tried for a time, and rejoice eternally.

‘A sword has passed through my heart’ said the Virgin, as she saw Christ hanging on the tree, ‘and it rends me, as Symeon foretold to me of old<a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a>. But arise, O Immortal, and glorify your Mother and handmaid with yourself, I pray’.

Slay the thought of the passions that trouble me, and calm my disordered movements by your divine authority, my God, for you are easily reconciled, compassionate and lover of humankind, granting me, in your compassion, forgiveness of faults, through the wealth of your loving kindness.

All-praised Martyrs, earth did not hide you, but heaven received you. For you the gates of Paradise stood open, and now within you enjoy the Tree of life. Intercede with Christ that there be granted to our souls his peace and great mercy.

All things are feebler than a shadow; all things are more deceptive than dreams; one instant, and death supplants them all. But give rest in the light of your countenance to those whom you have chosen, O Christ, and in the sweetness of your beauty, as you love humankind.
