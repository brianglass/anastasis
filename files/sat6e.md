PERIOD OF TONE SIX

**ON SATURDAY EVENING**

AT GREAT VESPERS
----------------

**After the Opening Psalm etc., at** Lord, I have cried… **we sing the following stichera of the Resurrection.**

Tone 6

Victorious over Hell, O Christ, you ascended the Cross that you might raise up with yourself those who sat in the darkness of death; free among the dead, you pour forth life from your own light. All-powerful Saviour, have mercy on us.

Today Christ, having trampled on death, has risen as he said, and granted joy to the world, that we may all shout aloud the hymn and say: O Source of life, O unapproachable light, All-powerful Saviour, have mercy on us.

Where shall we sinners escape you, O Lord, who are present in all creation? In heaven? You dwell there. In Hell? You trampled on death. In the depths of the sea? You hand is there, Master. To you we flee and falling down before you we implore: Lord risen from the dead, have mercy on us.

Other Resurrection Stichera by Anatolios.

We boast in your Cross, O Christ, and we hymn and glorify your Resurrection; for you are our God; we know no other but you.

Ever blessing the Lord we hymn his Resurrection; for having endured the Cross, by death he destroyed death.

Glory to your power, O Lord, for you destroyed the one that held the might of death; you have renewed us through your Cross, granting us life and incorruption.

Your burial, O Lord, smashed and tore apart the bonds of Hell; your Resurrection from the dead enlightened the world. Lord, glory to you!

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Who will not call you blessed, All-holy Virgin? Who will not hymn your child-birth without labour? For the only-begotten Son, who shone from the Father beyond time, came forth from you, pure Maiden, ineffably incarnate. By nature he is God, by nature he became man for our sakes, not divided in a duality of persons, but known without confusion in a duality of natures. O honoured and all-blessed, implore him to have mercy on our souls.

****

Resurrection Aposticha.

Angels in the heavens, Christ Saviour, hymn your Resurrection; grant that we to who are on earth may with pure hearts glorify you.

****

In alphabetical order.

You smashed the gates of brass and shattered the bars of Hell, as God all-powerful, and you raised the fallen human race. Therefore with one accord we too cry out: Lord, risen from the dead, glory to you!

Wishing to set us upright from our ancient fall, Christ was nailed to a cross and placed in a tomb. The Myrrhbearing Women, as they sought him with tears, said, lamenting: Alas, Saviour of all, how is it that you deigned to dwell in a tomb? How is it, since you dwelt there willingly, that you have been stolen? How is it that you have been moved? What place has hidden your life-bearing body? But Master, as you promised, appear to us, and bring to an end the grieving of our tears. But as they lamented an Angel cried out to them: End your lament! Say to the Apostles that: The Lord has risen, granting the world pardon and his great mercy.

You were crucified as you willed, O Christ, and by your burial you despoiled death. On the third day you rose as God in glory, granting the world unending life and your great mercy.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

My maker and redeemer, Christ the Lord, by coming from your womb, All-pure Lady, and clothing himself in me, freed Adam from the former curse. And so, All-pure, as to her who is truly the Mother of God and Virgin, we cry to you unceasingly the Angel’s ‘Hail’: Hail, Sovereign Lady, defence, protection and salvation of our souls.

****

Resurrection Apolytikion

Angelic powers were at your grave, and those who guarded it became as dead, and Mary stood by the tomb, seeking your most pure Body; you despoiled Hell, and emerged unscathed; you met the Virgin and granted life. Lord, risen from the dead, glory to you!

****

Theotokion

You who called your Mother blessed, came to the Passion by your own will; shining by the Cross, wishing to seek out Adam, saying to the Angels: Rejoice with me, for the drachma that was lost is found. You who disposed all things wisely: Glory to you!
