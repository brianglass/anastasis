In Holy Week the canons at Matins on the first three days are Triode, but this in not the case in December, and therefore the Triodes are included in Compline on the 20-22 of December. In Holy Week Great Thursday has a full canon, and so, on 23 December, the canon for Thursday is sung at Matins, as the acrostic makes clear. Bartholomew of Koutloumousiou has the following note on this canon, ‘In the manuscript at Koutloumousiou this Triode has the ascription, *Composition by Symeon Metphrastes*. The prosomia on the Wednesday before the Great Canon are also ascribed to him, according to the Typikon for the Annunciation, no. 6. But since Allatius (Prologue at the beginning of September, para. 8) does not include the Metaphrastes in the list of hymn writers, but says simply *Monk Symeon*, it seems that the present composition, and so the following Triodes as well, are by this Symeon, and not Symeon Metaphrastes’. He adds a further note, ‘In the 1843 Constantinople edition of the Menaia these Triodes are ascribed, *Composition of Symeon, the Logothete, the Metaphrastes.*</span>
