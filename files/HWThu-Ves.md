ON HOLY AND GREAT THURSDAY

VESPERS

****

The priest gives the blessing:

Blessed is the Kingdom of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and always, and to ages of ages.

****

The appointed monk or the Superior reads the Opening Psalm as follows:

Amen. Come let us worship and fall down before the King, our God.
Come let us worship and fall down before Christ the King, our God.
Come let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King and our God.

****

Psalm 103

Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you have been greatly magnified. You have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his upper chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind, making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle; waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at the voice of your thunder. The mountains rise and the plains descend to the place which you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await them to quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling: and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human heart. The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There the sparrows will build their nests; the heron’s dwelling is at their head. The high mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night, in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they will lie down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth has been filled with your creation. Also this great, wide sea; there there are creeping things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go to and fro; this dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to you to give them their food in due season. When you give it them, they will gather it. When you open your hand all things will be filled with goodness. But when you turn away your face they will be troubled. You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust. You will send forth your spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of the earth. May the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his works. He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. May my words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no more. Bless the Lord, my soul! ****

And again

The sun knew the hour of its setting: you made darkness, and it was night. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all!

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.
Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (**x3)**

Lord, I have cried **in Tone 2 and we insert the Stichera from Lauds, doubling them.**

Psalm 140

\[**A**\] Lord, I have cried to you, hear me; hear me, O Lord. Lord, I have cried to you, hear me. Give heed to the voice of my supplication when I cry to you. Hear me, O Lord.

\[

**B**\] Let my prayer be directed like incense before you: the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice. Hear me, O Lord.

\[

**A**\] Set a guard, O Lord, on my mouth: and a strong door about my lips.

\[

**B**\] Do not incline my heart to evil words: to make excuses for my sins.

\[

**A**\] With those who work iniquity: let me not unite with their elect.

\[

**B**\] The just will chastise me with mercy and reprove me: but let not the oil of sinners anoint my head.

\[

**A**\] For yet my prayer shall be in their pleasures: their judges have been swallowed up near the rock.

\[

**B**\] They will hear my words for they are sweet: as a clod of earth is crushed upon the ground their bones have been scattered at the mouth of Hell.

\[

**A**\] For my eyes look to you, O Lord, my Lord: I have hoped in you, do not take away my soul.

\[

**B**\] Keep me from the snare that they have hidden for me: and from the traps of evil-doers.

\[

**A**\] The sinners will fall into their own net: I am alone until I pass by. ****

Psalm 141

\[**B**\] With my voice I cried to the Lord: with my voice I entreated the Lord.

\[

**A**\] I will pour out my entreaty before him: and tell him all my trouble.

\[

**B**\] When my spirit was faint: you knew my path.

\[

**A**\] In the way where I walked: they had hidden a snare for me.

\[

**B**\] I looked to my right hand and saw: but there was none who knew me.

\[

**A**\] Escape is gone from me: and there is none who seeks for my soul.

\[

**B**\] I cried to you, Lord, I said, ‘You are my hope: my portion in the land of the living.’

\[

**A**\] Give heed to my supplication: for I am brought very low.

\[

**B**\] Deliver me from those who persecute me: for they are too strong for me. ****

For 10 verses. From the Triodion. We use those sung at Lauds, doubling the first four.

The Sanhedrin of the Jews now hurries together that it may hand over to Pilate the Creator and Fashioner of all things. Oh, the transgressors! Oh, the faithless!

Long-suffering Lord, great is your mercy. Glory to you!

Out of the depths I have cried to you, O Lord: Lord hear my voice. ****

By Monk John. Same Tone.

Judas the transgressor, Lord, having dipped his hand with you in the dish at the supper, stretched out his hands to take the silver pieces; and having reckoned up the price of the myrrh, he did not flinch from selling you, who are beyond price; the one who stretched out his feet to be washed, deceitfully kissed the Master to betray him to the transgressors; cast from the choir of Apostles, and having cast down the thirty silver pieces, he did not see your Resurrection on the third day. Through it have mercy on us.

If you, Lord, should mark iniquities: Lord, who will stand? But there is forgiveness with you. ****

From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch: let Israel hope in the Lord. ****

By Monk John. Same Tone.

Judas the slave and deceiver, the disciple and plotter, the friend and accuser, was revealed by his deeds; for he followed the Teacher and inwardly he plotted the betrayal; he said to himself, ‘I shall hand him over and gain the money that has been contracted’; he wanted the myrrh to be sold and Jesus to be taken by guile; he gave a kiss; he handed over Christ; and like a sheep to the slaughter so he followed, the only compassionate lover of humankind.

2.

Praise the Lord, all you nations: praise him all you peoples.

The Lamb which Isaias proclaimed is coming willingly to the slaughter, and gives his back to scourges, his cheeks to blows; he did not turn away his face from the shame of spittings; he is being condemned to a disgraceful death; the Sinless accepts all things willingly, that he may grant to all the resurrection from the dead.

****

For his mercy has been mighty towards us: and the truth of the Lord endures to the ages.

The Lamb which Isaias proclaimed is coming willingly to the slaughter, and gives his back to scourges, his cheeks to blows; he did not turn away his face from the shame of spittings; he is being condemned to a disgraceful death; the Sinless accepts all things willingly, that he may grant to all the resurrection from the dead.

Glory. Both now.

**Tone 6.**

Judas is truly of the brood of vipers who ate the Manna in the desert and murmured against their Nourisher; for while the food was still in their mouths the ungrateful ones spoke against God; and he, the impious, while bearing in his mouth the heavenly Bread, devised betrayal against the Saviour. O insatiable intent, and inhuman daring! He sold the one who nourished him and handed over to death the Master whom he kissed; truly the transgressor is their son, and with them he has inherited destruction. But, Lord, spare our souls from such inhumanity, who alone are boundless in long-suffering.

THE THANKSGIVING

Now that we have come to the setting of the sun and see the evening light, we sing the praise of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It is right at all times to hymn you with holy voices, Son of God, giver of life: therefore the world glorifies you.

The Lord said to Moses: Go down, solemnly charge the people and purify them to-day and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments; and let them stand ready on the third day; for on the third day the Lord will come down onto mount Sinai before all the people. And you shall separate the round about, saying: Watch yourselves not to ascend the mountain and to touch any of it; anyone who touches the mountain will die the death. A hand shall not touch it; for with stones he shall be stoned, or with a arrow he shall shot down; whether beast or human, he shall not live. But when the sounds and the trumpets and the cloud depart from the mountain, they shall ascend the mountain. Moses came down from the mountain to the people and hallowed them, and they washed their garments. And he said to the people: Get ready for three days, do not approach a woman. It came to pass on the third day, when it was towards dawn, and there were sounds and lightnings and a dark cloud on mount Sinai, the sound of the trumpet echoed loudly; and all the people in the camp trembled. And Moses led the people to the meeting with God outside the camp, and they took their stand beneath the mountain. The whole of mount Sinai smoked because God had come down upon it in fire, and the smoke went up like the steam from a furnace; and all the people was greatly amazed; and the sounds of the trumpet increased, growing louder and louder. Moses spoke, while God answered him with a sound.

**19-10-19**\]

The Lord said to Job out of whirlwind and clouds: Who is this that hides counsel from me, keeping words in the heart, while he thinks to hide them from me? Gird your loins like a man, while I shall question you; but you answer me! Where were you when I founded the earth? Tell me, if you possess understanding. Who laid its measures, if you know? Or who drew out a line upon it? On what are its rings fixed? Who is the one who placed a cornerstone upon it? When the stars came into being, all my angels praised me with a loud voice; I fenced the sea with gates, when it was being delivered, coming out of its mother’s womb; I placed a cloud for it as clothing, I swaddled it in mist; I placed limits for it, placing bars and gates round it. I said to it: As far as this you shall go, and you shall not go further, but your waves shall break in yourself. Or did I order the morning light in your time? the morning star to see its place, to lay hold on the wings of the earth, to shake off the ungodly from it? Or have you taken earth &lt;and&gt; clay and fashioned a living and speaking being, have you placed him on the earth? Have you taken light from the ungodly, and smashed the arm of the proud? Have you come to the source of the sea, trodden in the steps of the abyss? Do the gates of death open to you in fear, when they saw you did Hell’s gate-keepers tremble? Have you been instructed in the breadth of it &lt;the earth&gt; beneath heaven? Tell me, how great is it? In what land does the light pitch camp? What is the place of darkness? If you could bring me to its bounds, if you knew its paths, would you know it because you had been born then, because the number of your years is great? Job answered the Lord and said: \[

**42:1**\] I know that you can do all things, while nothing is impossible for you. For who is he that hides counsel from you? Being sparing of words and thinks to hide them from you? Who will declare to me what I did not know, great and wonderful things what I did not understand? Hear me, Lord, and I shall speak; I shall ask you, but do you teach me; I have heard of your report by ear before, but now my eye has seen you. ****

**50:4-11**\]

The Lord gives me a tongue of instruction to know when it is right to say a word; he has set me early, early, he has given me a ear for hearing; and the instruction of the Lord, the Lord, opens my ears, while I neither disobey nor gainsay. I gave my back to the scourges, my cheeks to blows, my face I did not turn away from the shame of spittings; and the Lord, the Lord became my helper, therefore I was not turned back, but set my face as a firm rock and I knew that I would in no way be shamed, because he who justifies me is near. Who the one who contends with me? Let him stand up with me together. Who is the one who contends with me? Let him come near me. See, the Lord, the Lord, will help me; who will do me wrong? See, you will all grow old as a garment, and as a moth he devours you. Who among you fears the Lord? Let him obey the voice of his servant. You who walk in darkness and in whom there is no light, trust in the name of the Lord and rely upon God. See, all of you, kindle a fire and make a flame strong; walk in the light of your fire, and in the flame which you have set burning; through me all these things have befallen you; in grief you will sleep.

\[

**11:23-32**\]

Brethren, I have received from the Lord what I have also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night he was handed over took bread and having given thanks broke it and said: Take, eat; this is my body broken for you; do this in memory of me. Likewise the cup also after supper, saying: This cup is the new testament in my blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in memory of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death, until he comes. So that whoever eats this bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the Lord’s body and blood. Let each one then test himself, and so let him eat of this bread and drink of the cup; for one who eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks judgement to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. Because of this many among you are weak and sick and some have fallen asleep. But if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged. But when we re judged, we are being disciplined by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.

The Lord said to his disciples, ‘You know that it is Passover in two days, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.’ Then the chief priests and scribes and elders of the people assembled at the court of the chief priest, who was called Caiaphas, and took counsel together to seize Jesus by trickery and kill him. But they said, ‘Not during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people.’ Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, a woman approached him with an alabaster jar of very precious ointment and she poured it on his head as he sat at table. When his disciples saw they were indignant and said, ‘Why this waste? For this ointment could have been sold for a great deal and given to the poor.’ But Jesus, knowing, said to them, ‘Why are you making trouble for the woman? She has performed a good deed for me. For you always have the poor with you; you do not always have me. By pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it for my burial. Amen I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told also in memory of her.’ Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, ‘What are willing to give me if I betray him to you?’ They settled with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from then on he was looking for an opportunity to betray him. On the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus and said to him, ‘Where do you wish us to make ready for you to eat the Passover?’ He said, ‘Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, ‘The teacher says, ‘My time is near. At your house I must celebrate the Passover with my disciples.’’’ And the disciples did as Jesus had ordered them and they made ready the Passover. When evening came he sat down with the twelve. Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come forth from God and was going back to God, rises from supper and lays aside his outer garments; and taking a towel he ties it round his waist. Then he puts water in the basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and wipe them with the towel which was tied round his waist. He comes to Simon Peter, who says to him, ‘Lord, are you going to wash my feet?’ Jesus answered and said to him, ‘What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand later.’ Peter says to him, ‘You shall never wash my feet.’ Jesus answered him, ‘Unless I wash you, you have no part in me.’ Peter says to him, ‘Lord, not only my feet, but my hands and my head also.’ Jesus says to him, ‘One who has washed has no need except to wash their feet, but they are wholly clean. And you are clean, but not all of you.’ For he knew the one who would betray him; that is why he said, ‘You are not all clean.’ So when he had washed their feet he put on his outer garments, sat down again and said to them, ‘Do you know what I have done to you? You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord’, and you do well, for I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you too should wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, you should do also. Amen, amen, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his lord, nor one who is sent greater than the one who sent him. If you know all this, blessed are you, if you do it.’ And as they were eating he said, ‘Amen I say to you, one of you is going to betray me.’ Deeply distressed they began to ask him one by one, ‘Surely not me, Lord?’ He answered and said, ‘The one who dips his hand with me in the dish is the one who is going to betray me. The Son of Man is going as is written of him; but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been better for that man not to have been born.’ Judas his betrayer said, ‘Surely not me, Rabbi?’ He said to him, ‘You have said so.’ While they were eating Jesus took bread and having blessed and broken it gave it to his disciples and said, ‘Take, eat; this is my body.’ He took the cup and having given thanks gave it to them saying, ‘Drink from this all of you; for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins. But I tell you that from now on I shall not drink from this fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it with you new in the kingdom of my father. And when they had sung a hymn they went out to the mount of olives. Then Jesus said to them, ‘You will all stumble and fall away from me this night. For it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ But after I have been raised I shall go before you into Galilee.’ Peter answered and said, ‘Even if all stumble and fall from you, I will never stumble.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Amen I say to you, this very night before a cock crows you will deny me three times.’ Peter says to him, ‘Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you.’ And all the disciples said the same. Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane and said to the disciples, ‘Sit here while I go over there and pray.’ And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee he began to grow sorrowful and distressed. Then Jesus said to them, ‘My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me.’ And going forward a little way he fell on his face and prayed, saying, ‘My father, if it is possible let this cup pass me by. But not as I wish, but as you do.’ An angel appeared to him from heaven to strengthen him. And being in agony he prayed more fervently; while his sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground. And rising from prayer he came to his disciples and found them asleep, and he said to Peter, ‘So, were you unable to watch with me for one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter the time of trial. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.’ Then he went away a second time and prayed, saying, ‘If this cup cannot pass me by unless I drink it, your will be done.’ And he came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy. And leaving them he went away again and prayed a third time, saying the same words. Then he comes to his disciples and says to them, ‘Sleep now, and rest! See, the moment has come and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise up, let us be going. See, the one who betrays me has come.’ While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and elders of the people. The one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, ‘The one I kiss is the man; seize hold of him.’ And he came straight up to Jesus and said, ‘Hail, Rabbi,’ and he kissed him. Jesus said to him, ‘Friend, for what purpose are you here?’ Then they came forward, took hold of Jesus and seized him. And one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword and struck the high priest’s slave and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, ‘Put your sword back in its place. For all who take the sword will die by the sword. Or do you imagine that I cannot ask my Father, and he will furnish me here and now with more than twelve legions of angels? But then how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must happen like this?’ At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, ‘You have come out to arrest me with swords and clubs, like a thief. Day by day I used to sit with you in the temple, and you did not seize me. But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled.’ Then all his disciples abandoned him and fled. But those who had seized him led him away to Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and elders had assembled. While Peter was following him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and he went in and sat with the servants to see the end. The chief priests and the elders and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death, but they found none. Though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. Finally two false witnesses came forward and said, ‘This man said, ‘I am able to destroy God’s temple and rebuild it in three days.’’ The chief priest arose and said to him, ‘Have you no answer? What are these men testifying against you?’ But Jesus was silent. The chief priest answered and said to him, ‘I put you under oath before the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the son of God?’ Jesus says to him, ‘It is you who have said it. But I tell you all, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.’ Then the chief priest rent his garments and said, ‘He has blasphemed. What further need do we have of witnesses? See, you have now heard his blasphemy. What is your verdict?’ They answered and said, ‘He deserves death.’ Then they spat in his face and hit him, while others slapped him as they said, ‘Prophesy, Christ: who it is that struck you?’ But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, ‘You were with Jesus the Galilean too.’ But he denied it in front of them all and said, ‘I do not know what you are talking about.’ As he was going out into the gatehouse another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, ‘This one too was with Jesus the Nazorean.’ And again he denied it with an oath, ‘I do not know the man.’ Shortly after the bystanders came up and said to Peter, ‘Truly you are one of them. For even your speech gives you away.’ Then he began to call down curses and to swear, ‘I do not know the man.’ And immediately a cock crowed. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, ‘Before a cock crows, you will deny me three times.’ And he went out and wept bitterly. Now when morning came all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, so as to put him to death. They bound him and led him away and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.

After the reading:

Reader:

Glory to you, Lord, glory to you! ****

<span id="mon23"></span>After the Gospel the Liturgy of St Basil the Great.

Instead of the Cherubic Hymn, the Communion chant,

We have seen the true light **and** Let our mouths be filled **we sing the following:**

Tone 6

Of your mystical Supper, Son of God, receive me today as a communicant; for I will not tell of the Mystery to your enemies; I will not give you a kiss, like Judas; but like the Thief I confess you: Remember me, Lord, in your Kingdom.

****

This is said many times at the Communion, while the Brethren receive the holy and immaculate Mysteries.

After the Prayer behind the Ambo there takes place the Office of the Washing of the Feet.

Then the broken bread is distributed, and the Dismissal.

In the refectory we partake of wine and oil. Compline we sing in our cells.
