**Canon to the Trinity, of which the Acrostic is:**
A fourth hymn to God
**by Metrophanes.**

****

Ode 1. Irmos. Through the Red Sea.

Let us glorify the Godhead, Trinity by persons, but a single nature of the three, co-eternal, equal in majesty, whom we entreat, saying: Save those who glorify you with faith!

The Son was anointed by the Father with the Spirit, the divine oil of gladness, and he became mortal, and taught the triple personhood of the one Godhead.

The beauty of your unapproachable glory, O Unity of triple sun, the Seraphim cannot bear to see and veil themselves with their wings and with thrice-holy songs unceasingly glorify you.

****

Theotokion.

You gave birth ineffably, O All-pure, to the Maker of all things who delivers mortals from the ancient curse and the corruption of death; and through you we acknowledge one God in three persons.

****

Ode 3. Let us not boast.

When you sent power from on high of old to your holy Apostles, O Christ, the Paraclete from the Father, you revealed the one nature with triple sun.

When you appeared to the Patriarch Abraham in human form, O triple Unity, you revealed the unchangeable nature of your lovingkindness and dominion.

O God, who are one, believed as in three persons, clearly uncircumscribed, incomprehensible to all, deliver our souls from every affliction.

****

Theotokion.

Instructed by the wise teaching of your Son, we glorify the single Godhead with triple lights, and we call you, the Ever-Virgin, blessed.

****

Kathisma. Come quickly to help.

Uncreated and consubstantial triple Sun, Unity in three persons and incomprehensible, take pity on your servants, save them from dangers, as God of mercy; for we have gained you, Lord, as our only Redeemer and Master as we cry: Be merciful to us!

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. The same.**

Surrounded by many troubles and dread disasters, Virgin Mother of God, and ever falling into despair, we have you as sole salvation, hope and wall, and as is fitting you we now beseech in faith: Save your servants.

****

Ode 4. The One enthroned in glory.

With the Seraphim we glorify you, supreme Lordship, Trinity beyond being in unity of Godhead, as of undivided nature, as without confusion, as exactly equal in glory, O God beyond understanding.

Godhead ineffably divided in persons and identical in your one lordship, alone without limit, uncircumscribed, the Maker of all creation, we sing your praise.

The Mind who is without beginning begot the Word ineffably, and sent out the divine Spirit, equal in might; and therefore we proclaim a consubstantial Trinity, the Master of all things as God.

****

Theotokion.

Appearing to those of old in types, the Word proclaimed beforehand his incarnation from you, O Virgin; but later he appeared to humankind in reality and revealed one Principle in three persons.

****

Ode 5. The universe was amazed.

Understanding from faith one unapproachable essence, but three consubstantial life-giving persons of the omnipotent Godhead, we honour Father, Son and Spirit, the holy co-eternal existence.

O single Godhead with triple sun, make the radiance of your essential splendour shine on me, O uncreated Nature, illuminating Source of every light-giving ray, that I may behold, as in a glass, your ineffable beauty.

Knowing you as only creator and sustainer and truly all-wise governor of the universe and giver of life, we cry out to you in faith: Master of triple sun, guard those who sing your praise.

****

Theotokion.

Wishing to make divine humanity that had been corrupted of old, the One who fashioned it and revealed the divine form of the image became man from you, O Virgin, and proclaimed one threefold Deity.

****

Ode 6. Prefiguring the three-day.

The Father as he spoke revealed the sonship and the Spirit that appeared to Christ at his baptism; therefore we glorify a Deity one and threefold.

When Isaias saw you seated upon a lofty throne being praised with thrice-holy hymns, he came to know the triple substance of the one Deity.

Exalted King in three persons, show forth the hearts of your servants to be on high, that we may radiantly contemplate the splendour of your glory.

****

Theotokion.

As he loves humankind the Son of God vouchsafed to be conformed to our nature from a Virgin, and he made humankind partaker in the divine glory.

****

Kathisma. Come quickly to help.

As we understand the Father to be unbegotten, the Son to be begotten and the Spirit to proceed from the Father, we proclaim a Kingship without beginning and one Godhead, which we glorify as we cry out with one accord: Consubstantial Trinity save us, O God.

****

Glory. Both now. Theotokion.

The God who is beyond times and before the ages, the God-man, you bore in time beyond nature in the flesh; therefore as we all confess you to be really and truly Mother of God, we cry out to you insistently: Count us all worthy of eternal glory.

****

Ode 7. The Children of Abraham.

All we born of earth, imitating the ranks of heavenly natures and the spiritual orders, with right belief glorify one Godhead in three persons equal in operation. (

**Twice**)

The sayings of the holy Prophets foreshowed you of old in symbols as one creator of all the ages, God inexpressible and Lord in three persons.

****

Theotokion.

Almighty Word, who cannot be seen in your own being, you appeared to humankind as a man from the pure Mother of God, restoring humankind to participation in your Godhead.

****

Ode 8. Stretching out his hands.

Light ruling as one and Essence shining with triple radiance, infinite beauty make your dwelling in my heart, and show me to be a pure and radiant temple of your Godhead, as I cry: Bless the Lord, all you works of the Lord! (

**Twice**)

From the manifold passions and the gloom of offences rescue me, O undivided Trinity, unconfused Unity, and enlighten me with your divine rays, that I may contemplate your glory and hymn you, Lord of glory.

****

Theotokion.

O Mind, unbegotten Father, and Word, one form with him, and Spirit identical in throne, Essence, Power, Existence beyond being, inexpressible, mighty in works, Trinity, Unity, guard your flock at the prayers of the Mother of God, as by nature you love humankind.

****

Ode 9. Let all born of earth.

Now I direct my whole heart and mind, and all the inclinations of my soul and body to you, my fashioner and deliverer, sole Sovereign of triple light, and I cry out to you: Save me your servant from temptations and afflictions of every kind. (

**Twice**)

Raise our mind and thought to you, the Most High, who dwell in approachable light, and enlighten them with your most pure radiance, Father, Word and Paraclete, sun of glory, lord of light, that we may always glorify you, God, sole Sovereign and of three Persons.

****

Theotokion.

Save those who believe in you, Lord, and who proclaim one eternal Essence without beginning, three divine and consubstantial Persons, and count us worthy of your divine glory at the entreaties of the pure Mother of God.
