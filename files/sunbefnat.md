The Sunday before the Nativity is that which falls between 18 December
and 24 December and commemorates the ’Holy and Godbearing Ancestors of
Christ, from Adam to Joseph the Betrothed’, following the genealogy in
the Gospel according to Luke, together with the Prophets and other Holy
Persons of the Old Covenant, both men and women. They are all listed in
the Synaxarion for the day, together with usual iambic couplet. The
present translation contains the complete list, but not yet the complete
set of couplets. I hope to have these completed next year. The Sunday is
also, in effect, part of the Forefeast of the Nativity,which strictly
speaking begins on 20 December, the feast of St Ignatios of Antioch.

The background to this page is from one of David Roberts’s paintings of
Bethlehem.
