INTRODUCTION
------------

The ceremony of the Washing of the Feet on Holy Thursday is very ancient, and is common to both East and West. In English it is the origin of the name ’Maundy Thursday’, from the Latin ’mandatum’, ’commandment’, which is used in the Vulgate of Saint John’s Gospel, ’mandatum nouum do uobis’, ’a new commandment I give you’. In the Latin the ceremony still forms part of the regular Holy Weeks services and in England, in a survival of pre-reformation Catholicism, the monarch still distributes specially purses of minted ’Maundy Money’ on this day, though there is no longer any washing of actual feet. In the fourth century the ’Pedilauium’, ’Footwashing’ formed part of the rite of Baptism at Milan, where it followed the Chrismation. Saint Ambrose remarks that the ceremony, as part of Baptism, was unknown in Rome. In the East it is still performed on Holy Thursday in the Armenian Church, but in the Byzantine Rite it is nowadays confined to some cathedrals and monasteries. On Patmos the monks of the great monastery perform the ceremony in the open air in the middle of the village.

This provisional version has been made from the text in the Greek Mega Euchologion, since the rite is no longer included in the printed Triodia in either Greek or Slavonic. In the French version published by P. Denis Guillaume the first Gospel is set out in dramatic form, with the Abbot speaking the words of Christ and the Bursar those of Saint Peter. Without at least a Deacon to read the Gospel while the Priest does the actual washing, it is difficult to perform the ceremony correctly, which may be one reason why it has fallen into desuetude.

SERVICE OF THE DIVINE AND SACRED WASHING
========================================

****

After the prayer behind the ambo, the Priest comes out, changed as he is, with lights and incense, outside the main doors of the church, the basin for the Washing having been got ready by the Ecclesiarch. Twelve brethren having been appointed who are to be washed by the Superior, among whom must be included the Porter and the Bursar, we assemble with the Priest, singing Psalm 50. When this is over we sing the 5th Ode of the Canon of Great Thursday.

Ode 5. Irmos

‘Bound with the bond of love, the Apostles offered themselves to Christ the Master of all things; when their beautiful feet had been washed clean they bring good tidings of peace to all.’

****

Troparia

The Wisdom of God that restrains the ungovernable upper water in the air, bridles the deeps and holds back the sea, pours water in a basin; the Master washes the feet of servants.

The Master shows his Disciples a model of humility; he who wraps the sky in clouds girds himself with a towel and bends the knee to wash the feet of servants; in his hand is the breath of all that is.

****

Then are sung the Idiomels of the Washing. Tone 1.

As you girded yourself with a towel and washed your Disciples’ feet, washing away the filth from our souls and gird us round with a spiritual bond, to do your commands and sing the praise of your goodness.

****

Tone 2.

About to enjoy a great grace, let us the faithful devoutly run together to the honoured Washing, not washing away the stain of the flesh, but spiritually sanctifying our souls; for Christ our Saviour, who looks upon the earth and makes and makes it tremble, bows himself down and touches feet of clay, granting safe walking upon every hostile power. To him let us cry aloud with thanksgiving: As you showed us the best road to exaltation, humility, save us, good Lord, as you love humankind.

****

Same Tone.

Peter was loathe for his feet to be washed by the spotless hands by which Adam had been fashioned. But when he heard, ‘Unless I wash you, you have no part with me’, seized with great fear, he cried to you, O Lord, ‘Do not wash only my feet, but also my hands and my head’. O how great are the Master’s gifts! He makes his own Disciples sharers in grace and promises that to have a part with them in ineffable glory, as he also said over the mystic cup, that he would drink it new with them in the Kingdom of heaven. Make us worthy of it too, as you are merciful and love humankind.

****

Tone 8.

Today the one who is by nature unapproachable took up the work of a slave. He who wraps the heavens with clouds, girded himself with a towel. He who divided the Red Sea, poured water for a washing; and bending his knees, he began to wash the feet of the Disciples and to dry them with the towel with which he had been girded. Then, having washed the Disciples’ feet, he said to them, ‘You are clean, but not all’, meaning the one who was betraying him.

****

Then the Litany by the Deacon.

In peace, let us pray to the Lord.

****

People:

Lord, have mercy. **And so after each petition.**

For the peace from on high and for the salvation of our souls, let us pray to the Lord.

****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

Ekphonesis by the Priest

For you are cleansing of our souls, and to you we give glory, together with your Father who has no beginning, and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ** **

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

Priest (Aloud):

Lord and God, supremely good, unapproachable in your divinity, who in the form of a slave took on the figure of a servant, and as an example of saving humility washed the feet of your Disciples with your spotless hands, and wiped them with a towel, look too upon us now, your unworthy servants, as we imitate the great glory of this your condescension; and count us worthy to wash away the defilements of the flesh and the filth of the soul through the contact of this water. Grant us the grace of the invisible visitation of your all-holy Spirit; make our souls and bodies secure from the cunning serpent that lies in wait for our heel; so that, having become pure, we may adore you fittingly, as we walk on snakes and scorpions and every power of the foe.

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, with your Father who has no beginning and your all-holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

Priest:

Peace to all. ****

People:

And to your spirit. ****

Deacon:

Bow your heads to the Lord. ****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

The Priest prays in a low voice.

Lord our God, who showed us the measure of humility by your own most exalted condescension, and declared the last in place to be first, grant us grace in the service of one another; exalt us by godlike humility; preserve us unstained, ever washed by tears and cleansed by the enlightenment of your cleansing grace; so that, ever falling down before you sincerely, we may find mercy and compassion at your dread Judgement Seat.

****

\[Aloud\]

For you, O God, are merciful and love humankind, and to you we give glory together with your Father who has no beginning and your all-holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ******

People:

Amen. ****

After the Ekphonesis, when the Priest says,

And that he would count us worthy*,* **those whose feet are be washed take their places on the benches provided. And as the Priest begins to read the 1st Gospel for the Washing, the Superior stands and does as the Gospel directs. When it says,** He laid aside his garments*,* **he takes off the mandyas. At,** Taking a towel, he girded himself*,* **he takes the apron and girds himself. At,** He poured water for the washing*,* **he too pours warm water. And again at,** He began to wash his Disciples’ feet*,* **he too begins to wash the feet of the 12 persons, starting with the Porter and ending with the Bursar and the Ecclesiarch, and to dry the feet of each of those whose feet have been washed and to kiss them. When he reaches the Bursar, the Priest reads the rest of the Gospel,** He comes then to Simon Peter, who says to him. **And then he completes what follows of the same Gospel, beginning,** And that he would count us worthy, **etc.**

Priest:

And that he would count us worthy to listen to the holy Gospel, let us pray to the Lord God. ****

Reader:

Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy. ****

Priest:

Wisdom. Stand upright. Let us listen to the holy Gospel. Peace to all. ****

Reader:

And to your Spirit. ****

Priest:

The reading is from the holy Gospel according to John. ****

Reader:

Glory to you, Lord, glory to you! ****

Priest:

Let us attend.

\[

**John 13: 3-11**\]

At that time, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come forth from God and was going back to God, rises from supper and lays aside his outer garments; and taking a towel he ties it round his waist. Then he puts water in the basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and wipe them with the towel which was tied round his waist. He comes to Simon Peter, who says to him, ‘Lord, are you going to wash my feet?’ Jesus answered and said to him, ‘What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand later.’ Peter says to him, ‘You shall never wash my feet.’ Jesus answered him, ‘Unless I wash you, you have no part in me.’ Peter says to him, ‘Lord, not only my feet, but my hands and my head also.’ Jesus says to him, ‘One who has washed has no need except to wash their feet, but they are wholly clean. And you are clean, but not all of you.’ For he knew the one who would betray him; that is why he said, ‘You are not all clean.’

****

After the completion of the Gospel, the Superior removes the apron and puts on the mandyas. Standing in his place, the Priest exclaims,

And that he would count us worthy to listen to the holy Gospel, let us pray to the Lord God.

****

Reader:

Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy. ****

Priest:

Wisdom. Stand upright. Let us listen to the holy Gospel. Peace to all. ****

Reader:

And to your Spirit. ****

Priest:

The reading is from the holy Gospel according to John. ****

Reader:

Glory to you, Lord, glory to you! ****

Priest:

Let us attend.

\[

**John 13: 12-17**\]

At that time, when Jesus had washed the feet of his Disciples, he put on his outer garments, sat down again and said to them, ‘Do you know what I have done to you? You call me “Teacher” and “Lord”, and you do well, for I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you too should wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, you should do also. Amen, amen, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his lord, nor one who is sent greater than the one who sent him. If you know all this, blessed are you, if you do it.’

****

Reader:

Glory to you, Lord, glory to you! ****

After the Gospel, the Priest says this prayer.

Let us pray to the Lord.

Lord our God, who in accordance with your great mercy emptied yourself, took the form of a slave, and at the moment of your saving, life-giving and voluntary Passion were pleased to sup with your holy Disciples and Apostles, and after this to gird yourself with a towel and wash the feet of your holy Disciples, giving them an example of humility and love for one another, and saying, ‘As I have done to you, so do likewise yourselves to one another, do you yourself, Master, being in the midst of your unworthy servants, who have followed your example, now wipe away too every spot and stain from our souls, so that we, having washed away the dust that was sticking to us from our offences, and having dried it with the towel of love, we may be able to be well-pleasing to you all the days of our life, and to find grace before you.

****

Aloud

For you are one who sanctifies and blesses all things, Christ our God, and to you we give glory, together with your Father who has no beginning and your all-holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

And all anoint their hands and faces with the water from the washing. Then we re-enter the Church, singing the following Troparia in Tone 6.

When their feet had been washed and they had been cleansed by participation in the divine Mystery, your servants, O Christ, went with you from Sion up to the great Mount of Olives, singing your praises, Lover of humankind.

See, my friends, you said, do not be afraid, for now the hour is near for me to be taken and to be slain by the hands of transgressors; while you will all be scattered and leave me; whom I shall gather to me, the Lover of humankind.

****

Then the Antidoron is given out and the Dismissal follows. As we enter the Refectory we sing Psalm 144 and partake of wine only. Compline we sing in our cells.
