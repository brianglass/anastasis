Among the texts for Holy Wednesday I would like to draw attention to two things.

The sermon of St Ephrem “ On the Harlot” exists in two slightly different versions, neither of which has, to my knowledge, been translated into English. I hope to do so in the not too far distant future. The Greek text is to be found in volumes 2 and 3 of Assemani‘s edition and, with a modern Greek version, in volume 7 of the edition published in Thessaloniki.

At Lauds the final Sticheron in Tone 6 is incorrect in the printed Triodia, where a clause has dropped out by haplography, and therefore in translations derived from these. The Sticheron is a Prosomion, to be sung to the same melody as the final one of the Aposticha, which is in fact the Automelon. The correct text has been restored by the Greek Holy Week published by the Apostoliki Diakonia. The corruption seems to be quite ancient, for the Slavonic text, which is obviously derived from the Greek, is also corrupt, though differently. It reads,

The woman drowned by sin found you, the harbour of salvation. ‘See, one who empties out myrrh with tears‘, she cried to you, ‘See, the One who waits for the repentance of the sinful. But, Master, save me from the tempest of my sin through your great mercy’.
