You clouds, rain down the sweetness of joy for those on earth, for a Child has been given, who is our God before the ages, incarnate from the Virgin.

****

Of the Mother of God. The same Irmos.

Through you he who is incomparable in goodness and power, was seen on earth and lived among men, to whom all we faithful sing as we cry: Let all creation that has been given existence hymn the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.

****

At Lauds, Stichera of the Resurrection.

Everything that has breath and every creature glorifies you, O Lord, for through your Cross you destroyed death to show the peoples your Resurrection from the dead, as you alone love humankind.

Let the Jews say how the soldiers lost the King they were guarding. Why did the stone not guard the rock of life? Either let them give up the one who was buried or praise him risen, saying with us: Glory to the multitude of your mercies: Saviour, glory to you!.

Rejoice you peoples and be glad: An Angel sat upon the grave stone; he gave us good tidings saying: Christ has risen from the dead and filled the universe with sweet fragrance. Rejoice you peoples and be glad!

Before your conception, Lord, an Angel brought the greeting ‘Hail’ to the one full of grace: at your Resurrection an Angel rolled the stone from your glorious grave. The one revealed the signs of joy instead of sorrow; the other instead of death proclaimed to us a Master, giver of life. Therefore we cry to you, ‘Benefactor of all humankind, Lord, glory to you!’

****

Other Stichera of Anatolios.

The women sprinkled sweet spices with their tears upon your grave, and their mouths were filled with joy as they said, ‘The Lord has risen!’

Let nations and peoples praise Christ our God, who willingly endured the Cross for us and spent three days in hell; and let them worship his Resurrection from the dead, through which all the ends of the world have been filled with light.

You were crucified, you were buried, O Christ, as you willed; you despoiled death as God and Master, granting the world eternal life and your great mercy.

In truth, lawless ones, by sealing the tomb you have granted us a greater marvel; the guards have the knowledge; today he came from the grave, and they said: You said that while we slept the Disciples came and stole him. And who steals a corpse, especially one that is naked? But he has risen by his own authority as God, leaving behind his grave-clothes in the tomb. Come, O Jews, see how he did not burst the seals the One who trampled on death and grants the human race life without end and his great mercy.

Glory.
