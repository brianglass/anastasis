THE HOLY AND DIVINE LITURGY OF THE PRESANCTIFIED GIFTS

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
-----------------

There are numerous small differences between the various Typica for the service of the Presanctified, particularly at the end of the Ninth Hour and end of the Typika. The arrangement given here represents, in the main, the use of the Holy Mountain, as given in the editions of the Holy Monastery of Simonos Petra, prepared with the assistance of Professor Phountoulis.

Those who use non-Orthodox versions of Holy Scripture, that is most current versions, should note that the Church‘s text of the prayer of the Thief in St Luke‘s Gospel is ‘Remember me, Lord, when you come in your kingdom‘, not ‘into your kingdom‘. The reference is to the Lord‘s Second Coming ‘in glory with the holy Angels‘. In the view of many non-Orthodox scholars this is the correct text.

In the troparia following the Beatitudes I have put ‘Lord Sabaoth‘, not ‘Lord of Sabaoth‘, or ‘Lord of hosts‘, because the Fathers, among them St Basil the Great, although they know the meaning of the Hebrew, point out that this is one of the Hebrew words that the translators of the Septuagint did not translate, and regard it as a sacred title of God.

In the Litany for those to be Enlightened I follow Professor Phountoulis in reading the invitation to them as ‘Draw near‘, in Greek *proselthete*, and not ‘Depart‘, in Greek *proelthete*; a difference of a single letter.

The Triodion, in its long rubric after Monday of the First Week, describes the ritual for the Presanctified and it specifies ‘Three metanias‘ at ‘Blessed be the name of the Lord‘ after the prayer behind the Ambo. I have therefore included it here.

It is also interesting to note that the same long rubric says, on the subject of the Litany for those preparing for Enlightenment, quite clearly, ‘It is to be known that the Diakonika for those to be enlightened and the prayer are started from the Wednesday of the Mid-Fast and said until Great Wednesday, not only at the Presanctified, but also on Saturdays and Sundays at the Liturgies of Saint John Chrysostom and Saint Basil‘. The Slavonic Triodion, on the other hand, in a rubric for the Wednesday of the Fourth Week, expressly excludes Saturdays and Sundays. The rubric in the Greek Triodion is likely to be the more ancient.

NINTH HOUR AND TYPIKA

****

About the ninth hour the Lamplighter strikes the ninth hour and we assemble in the Church.

After the Blessing by the Priest the Reader

\[**in Athonite use the Superior**\] **begins:**

Amen. Glory to you, our God, glory to you.

Heavenly King, Paraclete, Spirit of truth, present everywhere, filling all things, Treasury of blessings and Giver of life, come and dwell in us, cleanse us from every stain, and, O Good One, save our souls.

****

Reader:

Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us (**three times**).

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your name’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen

Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed; your kingdom come; your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

****

Priest:

For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. Lord, have mercy (**x12**), Glory. Both now.

Come, let us worship and fall down before the King, our God. Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ the King, our God. Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King, our God.

****

3 Metanias, then the Psalms.

Psalm 83

How beloved are your dwellings, O Lord of hosts; my soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God. For the sparrow has found itself a house, and the dove a nest for herself, where she may place her nestlings. Your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God. Blessed are those who dwell in your house, they will praise you for ever and ever. Blessed the man whose help is from you; he has placed ascents in his heart, to the valley of weeping, to the place he has set. For the lawgiver will give blessings; they will go from strength to strength, the God of gods will appear in Sion. O Lord God of hosts hear my prayer, give ear, O God of Jacob. O God our shield see; and look on the face of your Christ. For one day in your courts is far better than thousands. I have chosen to be cast aside in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners. O Lord God of hosts, blessed the man who hopes in you. ****

Psalm 84

You have been well pleased with your land, O Lord, you have turned away the captivity of Jacob. You have forgiven your people their iniquities, you have covered all their sins. You have made all your anger cease, you have turned away from the anger of your rage. Turn us back again, O God of our salvation, and turn away your rage from us. Will you be angry with us for ever? Or will you prolong your wrath from generation to generation? O God, when you have turned us back you will make us live, and your people will rejoice in you. O Lord, show us your mercy, and grant us your salvation. I shall hear what the Lord will say in me; for he will speak peace to his people, to his holy ones, to those who turn their hearts back to him. But his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth have met, justice and peace have kissed. Truth has dawned from the earth, and righteousness has leaned down from heaven. For the Lord will give goodness, and our earth will give its fruit. Justice will walk before him, and set his steps in the way. ****

Psalm 85

Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear me, for I am poor and needy. Guard my soul, for I am holy; O my God, save your servant who hopes in you. Have mercy on me, Lord, for I shall cry to you all the day; give joy to the soul of your servant, for I have lifted up my soul to you. For you, Lord, are good and gentle, and full of mercy to all who call on you. Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplication. In the day of my trouble I called to you, for you have heard me. There is none like you among the gods, O Lord; none whose works are as yours. All the nations whom you made will come and worship before you, O Lord, and call upon your name. For you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God. Guide me, Lord, in your way, and I shall walk in your truth; make my heart glad to fear your name. I shall give you thanks, O Lord, my God, with my whole heart; and I shall glorify your name for ever. For your mercy is great towards me, and you have delivered my soul from the lowest hell. O God, the lawless rose up against me, and an assembly of mighty ones sought my soul, and did not set you before them. And you, Lord, are pitying and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy and true. Look on me and have mercy on me; give your might to your servant and save the son of your maidservant. Make for me a sign for good, and let those who hate me see it and be shamed; for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me. ****

And again:

Make for me a sign for good, and let those who hate me see it and be shamed; for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.

Glory. Both now. Alleluia (

**x3**). Lord, have mercy (**x3**). ****

And we read one Kathisma of the Psalter. At each Antiphon we make 3 prostrations and after the completion of the Kathisma we chant the following Troparion.

Tone 8.

Christ our God, who at the ninth hour tasted death in the flesh for our sakes, slay our carnal will and save us.

****

And as we repeat it we make a prostration to the ground, and likewise at the following two Verses.

Verse 1:

May my supplication come into your presence, O Lord, according to your word give me understanding. ****

Verse 2:

Let my petition come into your presence, O Lord, according to your word save me.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

O Good One, you were born of a Virgin for our sakes and endured crucifixion; you despoiled death by death and as God revealed resurrection, do not despise those whom you fashioned with your own hand; show your love for mankind, O Merciful; accept the Mother of God who bore you, as she intercedes for us, and save, O Saviour, a people in despair.

****

And immediately we read from The Ladder.

And after the reading:

For your holy name’s sake do not finally reject us, do not annul your covenant, do not take your mercy from us for the sake of Abraham, your beloved, and for the sake of Isaac, your servant, and Israel, your holy one.

****

Then the Trisagion etc.

And the following Troparia

The Thief seeing the prince of life hanging on the Cross, said: If he who is crucified with us were not God incarnate, the sun would not have hidden its rays, nor would the shaken earth be quaking. But you who bear all things, Remember me, Lord, in your kingdom.

Glory.

Between two thieves your Cross became the scales of justice: the one was dragged down to hell by the weight of his blasphemy, but the other lightened of his faults was raised to the knowledge of the things of God. Christ God, glory to you.

Both now.

Seeing the Lamb and Shepherd and Saviour of the world on the Cross, she who bore Him said weeping: The world rejoices, for it receives redemption; but my inward parts burn as I see your crucifixion, which you endure for all mankind, O my Son and my God.

****

Then:

Lord, have mercy. (**x40**).

Glory. Both now, Greater in honour than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word, truly Mother of God we magnify you. In the name of the Lord, bless, Father.

****

Priest:

May God take pity on us. ****

And having made only 3 full metanias with the Prayer of St Ephrem we stand up again in order in the Choirs and begin the Beatitudes, with melody in a loud voice and slowly, singing after each one in the 8th Tone:

Remember us, O Lord, when you come in your Kingdom.

****

Likewise after the

Glory **and the** Both now. **We make a small prostration after each** Remember. ****

The Beatitudes.

\[**Matthew 5:3-12**\]

In your kingdom remember us, O Lord, when you come in your kingdom.

Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after justice, for they shall be filled.

Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.

Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.

Blessed are those who are persecuted for justice’s sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.

Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

Both now and for ever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

The Choirs unite, and the following are sung more solemnly and we make a full metania at each one.

Remember us, O Lord, when you come in your kingdom.

Remember us, O Master, when you come in your kingdom.

Remember us, O Holy One, when you come in your kingdom.

The heavenly choir hymns you and says: Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord Sabaoth, heaven and earth are full of your glory.

****

Verse:

Come to him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be ashamed.

The heavenly choir hymns you and says: Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord Sabaoth, heaven and earth are full of your glory.

Glory.

The choir of holy Angels and Archangels with all the heavenly Powers hymns you and says: Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord Sabaoth, heaven and earth are full of your glory.

Both now.

I believe in one God, Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten from the Father before all ages. Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made; for our sake and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and was incarnate from the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man; he was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried; he rose again on the third day, in accordance with the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father; he is coming again in glory to judge the living and the dead; and his kingdom will have no end.

And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life, who proceeds from the Father, who together with Father and Son is worshipped and together glorified; who spoke through the Prophets. In one, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church; I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins. I await the resurrection of the dead and the life of the age to come. Amen.

****

Then

Remit, forgive, pardon, O God, our offences, willing and unwilling, in deed and in word, in knowledge and in ignorance, of the day and of the night, in mind and in thought; pardon them all, as you are good and love mankind.

****

Then

Our Father. For yours. ****

After this we say the Kontakion of the Transfiguration. Tone 7.

You were transfigured on the mountain, Christ God, and your disciples saw your glory, as far as they were able; so that when they saw you crucified, they might understand that your Passion was voluntary, and proclaim to the world that you are truly the brightness of the Father.

****

Then on Monday. Of the Angels. 2nd Tone.

Chief captains of God, ministers of divine glory, guides of mankind, and princes of the Bodiless hosts, intercede for what is for our good and for great mercy, as chief captains of the Bodiless hosts.

****

On Tuesday. Of the Forerunner. 2nd Tone.

Prophet of God and Forerunner of grace, having found your Head, as a most sacred rose, we ever receive gifts of healing; for once again, as of old, you are proclaiming repentance.

****

On Wednesday and Friday. Of the Cross. 4th Tone.

Lifted up on the Cross of your own will, grant your mercies, O Christ God, to the new commonwealth called by your name. Make your faithful people glad by your power, giving them victory over their enemies. May they have your help in battle, a weapon of peace, an invincible trophy.

****

On Thursday. Of the Apostles. 2nd Tone.

You have taken, Lord, the sure, the God-inspired heralds, the high peak of your Disciples, for the enjoyment of your good things and for repose; for you accepted above every offering their toils and their death, you who alone know what is in the heart.

****

And of Saint Nicholas. 3rd Tone.

In Myra, holy one, you were proved a true priest, for you fulfilled, venerable Father, the gospel of Christ, you laid down your life for you people, you saved the innocent from death; therefore you have been hallowed as a great initiate of God’s grace.

****

Every day the Kontakion of the Church.

Kontakion. 2nd Tone. Nor tomb, nor death.

Let us sing the praise of God’s herald, whose name means ‘courage’, the First-called of the Saviour’s disciples, the brother of Peter; because as to him of old, so now to us he cries, ‘Come, we have found the one so longed for’.

****

Then the Martyrikon of the Tone, followed by

Glory. **Of the Departed. Tone 8.**

With the saints give rest, O Christ, to your servants, where there is no toil, nor grief, nor sighing, but life everlasting.

Both now.

**Theotokion. Tone 2.**

Protection of Christians that cannot be put to shame, unfailing mediation with the Maker, do not despise the voices of us sinners as we pray; but, in your love, be quick to help us who cry to you with faith: Hasten to intercede, make speed to entreat, O Mother of God, for you ever protect those who honour you.

****

Then:

Lord, have mercy. (**x40**)

At every time and at every hour, in heaven and on earth worshipped and glorified, Christ God, long-suffering, great in mercy, great in compassion, loving the just and merciful to sinners, calling all to salvation by the promise of the blessings to come; do you, Lord, yourself accept our entreaties at this hour, and direct our lives to your commandments. Sanctify our souls, purify our bodies, correct our thoughts, cleanse our ideas and deliver us from every distress, evil, and pain. Wall us about with your holy Angels, that protected and guided by their host we may reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of your unapproachable glory; for you are blessed to the ages of ages. Amen.

Lord, have mercy (

**x3**). Glory. Both now. Greater in honour than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word, truly the Mother of God we magnify you. In the name of the Lord, bless, Father. ****

Priest:

May God take pity on us… ****

We say the Prayer of St Ephrem with 4 full and 12 small metanias. Then Trisagion,

All-holy Trinity, Our Father. For yours. Lord, have mercy (**x12**) **and the Superior says the following prayer:**

Prayer of Saint Basil the Great

Master, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, who have long endured our transgressions, and brought us to this hour in which hanging on the life-giving tree you showed the good Thief the way into Paradise and destroyed death by death, have mercy also on us sinners and your unworthy servants. For we have sinned and trespassed and are not worthy to raise our eyes and look on the height of heaven; because we have abandoned the way of your justice and walked in the will of our hearts. But we implore your unbounded goodness: spare us, O Lord, according to the multitude of your mercy, and save us for your holy name’s sake, for our days have been wasted in vanity. Rescue us from the hand of our opponent, forgive us our sins, slay our carnal will, that we, having put off the old man, may put on the new, and live for you, our Master and benefactor; and that thus following your precepts we may reach eternal rest, where those who rejoice have their dwelling. For you are the true joy and gladness of those who love you, Christ our God, and to you we give glory, together with your Father who has no beginning, and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and always and to ages of ages. Amen.

****

Then the Lamplighter goes out and strikes the large simandron. After the Prayer of Saint Ephrem, Trisagion,

All-holy Trinity…, Our Father, Lord, have mercy, (**x12**) **and this prayer:**

All-holy Trinity, consubstantial Might, indivisible Kingship, Cause of all blessings, be favourable even to me a sinner; strengthen and give understanding to my heart and rid me of every defilement; enlighten my mind, that I may ever glorify, praise, worship and say: One is Holy, one is Lord, Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the Father. Amen.

****

Reader:

It is truly right to call you blessed, who gave birth to God, ever-blessed and most pure and the Mother of our God. Greater in honour than the Cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word. Truly the Mother of God, we magnify you. In the name of the Lord bless, Father. ****

Priest:

May God be take pity on us…. Glory to you, Christ God our hope, glory to you. ****

Reader:

Glory. Both now. Lord, have mercy (**x3**) **And the Dismissal**

VESPERS

****

The priest gives the blessing:

Blessed is the Kingdom of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and always, and to ages of ages.

****

The appointed monk or the Superior reads the Opening Psalm as follows:

Amen. Come, let us worship and fall down before the King, our God. Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ the King, our God. Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King and our God.

****

Psalm 103

Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you have been greatly magnified. You have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his upper chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind, making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle; waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at the voice of your thunder. The mountains rise and the plains descend to the place which you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await them to quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling: and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human heart. The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There the sparrows will build their nests; the heron’s dwelling is at their head. The high mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night, in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they will lie down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth has been filled with your creation. Also this great, wide sea; there there are creeping things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go to and fro; this dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to you to give them their food in due season. When you give it them, they will gather it. When you open your hand all things will be filled with goodness. But when you turn away your face they will be troubled. You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust. You will send forth your spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of the earth. May the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his works. He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. May my words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no more. Bless the Lord, my soul! ****

And again

The sun knew the hour of its setting: you made darkness, and it was night. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all!

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (

**x3**) ****

When the Opening Psalm is completed the Priest says the:

Litany of Peace

Priest:

In peace, let us pray to the Lord. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. **And so after each petition.**

Priest:

For the peace from on high and for the salvation of our souls, let us pray to the Lord.

For the peace of the whole world, for the welfare of the holy Churches of God, and for the union of all, let us pray to the Lord.

****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

The Priest in a low voice says the 1st Prayer at the Lighting of the Lamps

O Lord, compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy, listen to our prayer and attend to the voice of our supplication. Make for us a sign for good. Guide us in your way, to walk in your truth. Make glad our hearts to fear your holy Name, because you are great and do wondrous things. You alone are God, and there is none like you, O Lord, among gods: powerful in mercy and loving in strength to help and to console and to save all who hope in your holy Name.

****

Priest, aloud:

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

People:

Amen. ****

After the Litany, the appointed Kathisma of the Psalter is read by one Reader.

KATHISMA EIGHTEEN

****

Psalm 119 A Song of Ascents.

When I was afflicted I called to the Lord, and he heard me. O Lord, deliver my soul from unjust lips and from a deceitful tongue. What should be given you, what added to you against a treacherous tongue? The sharpened arrows of the powerful, with the coals of desolation. Woe is me! For my sojourning has been prolonged, I have camped among the encampments of Kedar; my soul has long been a sojourner. With those who hate peace I was peaceable; when I spoke with them, they made war on me for nothing.

****

Psalm 120 A Song of Ascents.

I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains. From where will my help come? My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. Do not let your foot waver; may he who guards you not slumber. See, he who guards Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord will guard you, the Lord is protection for you on your right hand. By day the sun will not scorch you, nor the moon by night. The Lord will guard you from every evil, the Lord will guard your soul. The Lord will guard your coming in, and your going out, from now and for ever more.

****

Psalm 121 A Song of Ascents.

I rejoiced at those who said to me: we shall go to the house of the Lord. Our feet were standing in your courts, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem built as a city, shared by all together. For there the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord. For there thrones were set for judgement, thrones over the house of David. Ask then for the things which are for Jerusalem’s peace, and prosperity for those who love you. May there be peace then in your power and prosperity in your citadels. For the sake of my brethren and neighbours, I have spoken peace concerning you. For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I have sought good things for you.

****

Psalm 122 A Song of Ascents.

I have lifted my eyes to you who dwell in heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look to their lords’ hands; as the eyes of a maid to her mistress’s hands, so do our eyes to the Lord our God, until he take pity on us. Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us, for we have had our fill of contempt, our soul has been filled to overflowing. Let reproach be for the prosperous, and contempt for the proud.

****

Psalm 123 A Song of Ascents.

If the Lord had not been among us, let Israel now say: if the Lord had not been among us when men rose up against us, they would have swallowed us down alive. When their fury raged against us; the water would have drowned us, our soul would have passed through the torrent; our soul would have passed through irresistible water. Blessed is the Lord, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul was delivered like a sparrow from the snare of the hunters; the snare was shattered, and we were delivered. Our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (

**x3**) Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Priest:

Again and again in peace, let us pray to the Lord. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

Priest:

Help us, save us, have mercy on us and keep us, O God, by your grace. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

Priest:

Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most blessed and glorious Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, with all the Saints, let us entrust ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God. ****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

The Priest in a low voice says the 2nd Prayer at the Lighting of the Lamps

Lord, do not rebuke us in your anger, nor chastise us in your wrath, but deal with us in accordance with your kindness, physician and healer of our souls. Guide us to the harbour of your will. Enlighten the eyes of our hearts to the knowledge of your truth and grant that the rest of the present day and the whole time of our life may be peaceful and without sin, at the prayers of the holy Mother of God and of all the Saints.

****

Priest, aloud:

For yours is the Might, and yours is the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and always and to ages of ages. ****

People:

Amen ****

Psalm 124 A Song of Ascents.

Those who trust in the Lord are as Mount Sion; one who dwells in Jerusalem will never be shaken. Mountains encircle her, and the Lord encircles his people from now and for ever. For the Lord will not leave the rod of sinners upon the heritage of the just, lest the just stretch out their hands in iniquities. Do good, Lord, to the good and to the honest in heart. But the Lord will drive away with those who work iniquity those who turn aside to extortions; peace upon Israel.

****

Psalm 125 A Song of Ascents.

When the Lord turned back the captivity of Sion, we became as those who are comforted. Then was our mouth filled with joy and our tongue with rejoicing. Then they will say among the nations: the Lord has done great things with them. The Lord has done great things with us, we have become joyful. Turn back our captivity, O Lord, like streams in the south. Those who sow with tears, will reap with joy. They went and as they went they wept, while they sowed their seed. But when they come they will come with joy, as they gather up their sheaves.

****

Psalm 126 A Song of Ascents.

Unless the Lord build the house, the builders have toiled for nothing. Unless the Lord guard the city, the watchman has kept vigil for nothing. Your getting up at dawn is for nothing, your rising after sitting, you who eat the bread of sorrow, when he gives sleep to his beloved; see, sons are the Lord’s inheritance , the reward of the fruit of the womb. As arrows in the hand of a powerful man, so are the sons of the rejected. Blessed the man who satisfies his desire with them; they will not be shamed when they speak with their enemies in the gates.

****

Psalm 127 A Song of Ascents

Blessed are all who fear the Lord, who walk in his ways. You will eat the toils of your fruits; you are blest, and it will be well with you. Your wife like a luxuriant vine against the sides of your house. Your sons like new olive shoots around your table. See, that is how one who fears the Lord will be blessed. The Lord bless you from Sion, and may you see the good things of Jerusalem all the days of your life. And may you see your children’s children. Peace upon Israel.

****

Psalm 128 A Song of Ascents

Many times they have made war on me since my youth, let Israel now say. Many times they have made war on me since my youth, and yet they have not prevailed over me. The sinners have wrought upon my back, they have prolonged their iniquity. The Lord is just, he has broken the sinners’ necks. Let all those who hate Sion be shamed and turned back. Let them become like grass on the housetops, which withers before it is uprooted: The reaper has not filled his hand with it, nor the one who gathers the sheaves his bosom. Nor have the passers-by said: The Lord’s blessing be on you. We have blessed you in the name of the Lord.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (

**x3**) Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

The Priest in a low voice says the 3rd Prayer at the Lighting of the Lamps

Lord our God, remember us, sinners and your unprofitable servants, as we call upon your holy Name, and do not put us to shame from the expectation of your mercy, but graciously grant us, Lord, all the requests that are for salvation, and count us worthy to love and to fear you from our whole heart, and in all things to do your will.

Psalm 129 A Song of Ascents

Out of the depths I have cried to you, O Lord; Lord, hear my voice; let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication. If you note our iniquities, Lord Lord, who will survive? Because forgiveness is with you. For your name’s sake I have waited for you, O Lord; my soul has waited for your word, my soul has hoped in the Lord. From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch, let Israel hope in the Lord. Because with the Lord there is mercy and with him abundant redemption; and he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

****

Psalm 130 A Song of Ascents

Lord, my heart has not been exalted, nor have my eyes become lofty, I have neither walked among great affairs, nor among marvels beyond me. If I had not been humble-minded but exalted my soul, like a weaned child towards its mother, so You will requite my soul. Let Israel hope in the Lord, from now and for ever.

****

Psalm131 A Song of Ascents

Lord remember David and all his meekness, how he swore to the Lord, made a vow to the God of Jacob, I shall not enter the shelter of my house, climb into my bed, give sleep to my eyes, slumber to my eyelids and rest to my temples, until I find a place for the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. See, we heard of it in Ephrata, we found it in the woodland fields. We shall enter his tabernacles, we shall worship towards the place where his feet have stood. Arise, Lord, into your rest, you and the ark of your sanctification. Your priests clothe themselves with justice, and your holy ones will rejoice. For David, your servant’s sake, do not turn away the face of your Christ. The Lord has sworn truth to David and he will not annul it, ‘From the fruit of your womb I shall place on your throne. If your sons keep my covenant and these testimonies of mine which I shall teach them, their sons too will sit on your throne for ever. For the Lord has elected Sion, has chosen her as a dwelling for himself. ‘This is my resting-place for age on age; here I shall dwell, for I have chosen her. Her door I shall bless abundantly, her poor I shall fill with bread. Her priests I shall clothe with salvation, and her holy ones will rejoice with great joy. There I shall make the horn of David flourish; I have prepared a lamp for my Christ. I shall clothe his enemies in shame, my sanctification will flower upon him’.

****

Psalm 132 A Song of Ascents

See how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together. Like sweet ointment on the head which runs down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, which runs down to the hem of his garment; like the dew from Hermon, which runs down upon the mountains of Sion; for there the Lord has commanded the blessing: life for ever more.

****

Psalm 133 A Song of Ascents

Come, now bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. Lift up your hands by night to the Holy Place, and bless the Lord. May the Lord bless you from Sion, he who made heaven and earth.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (

Psalm 140

\[

**A**\] Lord, I have cried to you, hear me; hear me, O Lord. Lord, I have cried to you, hear me. Give heed to the voice of my supplication when I cry to you. Hear me, O Lord.

\[

**B**\] Let my prayer be directed like incense before you; the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice. Hear me, O Lord.

\[

**A**\] Set a guard, O Lord, on my mouth, and a strong door about my lips.

\[

**B**\] Do not incline my heart to evil words; to make excuses for my sins.

\[

**A**\] With those who work iniquity, let me not unite with their elect.

\[

**B**\] The just will chastise me with mercy and reprove me; but let not the oil of sinners anoint my head.

\[

**A**\] For yet my prayer shall be in their pleasures; their judges have been swallowed up near the rock.

\[

**B**\] They will hear my words for they are sweet. As a clod of earth is crushed upon the ground, their bones have been scattered at the mouth of Hell.

\[

**A**\] For my eyes look to you, O Lord, my Lord. I have hoped in you, do not take away my soul.

\[

**B**\] Keep me from the snare that they have hidden for me, and from the traps of evil-doers.

\[

**A**\] The sinners will fall into their own net. I am alone until I pass by.

\[

**B**\] With my voice I cried to the Lord. With my voice I entreated the Lord.

\[

**A**\] I will pour out my entreaty before him, and tell him all my trouble.

\[

**B**\] When my spirit was faint, you knew my path.

\[

**A**\] In the way where I walked they had hidden a snare for me.

\[

**B**\] I looked to my right hand and saw, but there was none who knew me.

\[

**A**\] Escape is gone from me, and there is none who seeks for my soul.

\[

**B**\] I cried to you, Lord, I said, ‘You are my hope; my portion in the land of the living.’

\[

**A**\] Give heed to my supplication, for I am brought very low.

\[

**B**\] Deliver me from those who persecute me, for they are too strong for me. ****

It is right at all times to hymn you with holy voices, Son of God, giver of life. Therefore the world glorifies you.

Psalm 33

I will bless the Lord continually, his praise will always be in my mouth. My soul will be praised in the Lord; let the meek hear it and rejoice. Magnify the Lord with me, let us exalt his name together. I sought the Lord and he heard me, and delivered me from all my afflictions. Come to him and be enlightened, and your faces will not be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him from all his afflictions. The angel of the Lord will encamp round those who fear him, and deliver them. Taste and see that the Lord is good. Blessed the one who puts their hope in him! Fear the Lord, all you his saints, for those who fear him never want. The rich have become poor and gone hungry, but those who seek the Lord will not be deprived of any good. Come, children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Who is there who wants life, loves to see good days? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are on the just, and his ears towards their supplication. The Lord’s face is set against those who do evil, to destroy their memory from the earth. The just cried and the Lord heard them, and delivered them from all their afflictions. The Lord is close to those who are broken-hearted, and will save the humble in spirit. The afflictions of the just are many, but the Lord will deliver them from them all. The Lord guards all their bones, not one of them will be broken. The death of sinners is evil, and those who hate the just will go astray. The Lord will rescue the souls of his servants, and no one of those who hope in him will go astray. ****

Priest:

The blessing of the Lord be upon you, through his divine grace and love for mankind, always, now and ever, and to ages of ages. ****

Priest:

Glory to you, O God, our hope, glory to you. ****

And the Dismissal

Glory to you, Christ God, our hope, glory to you.

****

Reader:

Glory. Both now. Lord, have mercy (**x3**). Give the blessing. ****

And the Priest continues:

May Christ our true God, at the prayers of his most pure and holy Mother; of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles; of Saint

**N.** \[**the patron of the church**\], of Saint **N.**, whose memory we celebrate; of the holy and righteous forebears of God, Joachim and Anne and of all the Saints, have mercy on us and save us, for he is good and loves mankind. ****

Turning to the East, he says,

Through the prayers of our holy Fathers, Lord Jesus Christ our God, have mercy on us.

****

People:

Amen.

Many books follow Psalm 33 with Psalm 144. The latter is not, strictly, part of the Liturgy of the Presanctified, but the opening of Grace before Meals, since in monasteries the single meal on a fast day is eaten immediately after Vespers and the Liturgy of the Presanctified. For completeness sake, we add it here as an appendix.

PSALM 144 Praise for David.

I will exalt you, my God, my King; and I will bless your name for ever and to age on age. Every day I will bless you; and praise your name for ever and to age on age. The Lord is great and highly to be praised**;** and there is no limit to his greatness. Generation after generation will praise your works; and will declare your power. They will tell of the majesty of the glory of your holiness; and will recount your wonders. They will speak of the power of your dread deeds; and will recount your greatness. They will proclaim the memory of the multitude of your goodness; and rejoice in your justice. The Lord is compassionate and merciful; long-suffering and full of mercy. The Lord is good to all; and his acts of compassion are for all his works. May all your works confess you, Lord; and all your holy ones bless you. They will speak of the glory of your kingdom; and tell of your power. To make known your power and of the glory the majesty of your kingdom to the children of mankind. Your kingdom is a kingdom for all the ages, and your dominion for every generation. The Lord is faithful in all his words, and holy in all his works. The Lord supports all who are falling, and sets upright all who are broken down. The eyes of all hope in you, and you give them their food in due season. You open your hand, and fill every living thing with your good pleasure. The Lord is just in all his ways, and holy in all his works. The Lord is close to those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. He will do the will of those who fear him, and hear their supplication and save them. The Lord guards all who love him, and all sinners he will destroy. My mouth will tell the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and to age on age.
