After the 1st Reading from the Psalter Kathismata of Compunction. Tone 3.

As you sojourn on earth, my soul, repent; dust in tomb does not sing hymns, is not delivered from faults; cry out to Christ God: Knower of hearts, I have sinned; before you condemn me, spare me, O God, and have mercy on me.

****

Verse:

Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger; nor chastise me in your wrath.

For how long, my soul, will you remain with your faults? Until when will you delay repentance? Call to mind the judgement to come, cry out to Christ God: Knower of hearts, I have sinned; sinless Lord, have mercy on me!

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Hail Mary, Mother and Virgin, the holy mountain, the Paradise in Eden; from whom without seed was born Christ God the Word, through whom life budded for the world.

****

After the 2nd Reading, Kathismata.

At the dread assize, without accusers I am convicted, without witnesses I am condemned; for the books of the conscience are opened, and hidden deeds are disclosed; then before you are to examine my actions in that most public theatre, O God, have mercy on me and save me.

****

Verse:

Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger; nor chastise me in your wrath.

A dread tribunal awaits me, Lord; for though I remain silent, my deeds cry out; but before that Christ God through repentance seek one who has strayed, and save me.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

You have become a divine tabernacle of the Word, O Virgin Mother, alone pure, in purity surpassing Angels; purify me then, who above all others have become fouled by offences of the flesh, with the inspired streams of your prayers, and grant me, holy Lady, his great mercy.

****

After the 3rd Reading, Kathismata.

As all-powerful by a word you brought to be the things of heaven and the things of earth; while the choirs of Angels, as they stand with trembling round about, offer you, O Master, unceasing praise, crying out by your light to all the ends of the earth; through them we too cry aloud to you: Save us by your compassion.

****

Verse:

God is wonderful in his Saints, the God of Israel. ****

Of the Martyrs.

The courage of your endurance conquered the devices of the foe, origin of evil, All-praised Champions; therefore you have been granted eternal blessedness; but intercede with the Lord to save the flock of the people that loves Christ, for you are Martyrs for the truth.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

With fear the things of heaven rejoiced, with trembling things on earth were glad when the immaculate voice came upon you, Mother of God; for one festival shone out for both, when the Master delivered the first-formed; and so with the Angel we cry to you: Hail, full of grace!

****

Slaying me the trickster killed my with the passions; O Giver of life, make me live by ways of repentance.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Unjustly set aflame by material fire, you were enflamed, O Martyrs, immaterially by the love of the immaterial.

I have been wounded by the sword of the passions and have fallen into the pit of despair; do not reject me, but heal me, Master, with the medicine of turning back.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Raked terribly with iron claws, struck with swords and wasted by scourges, brave Athletes, you did not bow the knee to carved idols.

The world is adorned by your sufferings, holy Martyrs; you have found a life with the Angels beyond the world.

****

Puffed up in thought as once the Pharisee of old I have fallen with a dreadful fall, and seeing it the deceiver is delighted; O Christ, who humbled him by the Cross, take pity on me who have been terribly humbled.

I have become the friend of sin, as no one who has ever lived, and I have squandered your long-suffering, wretch that I am, yet still I remain unfeeling: turn me back in your compassion.

****

Of the Martyrs.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Outspoken lanterns of true religion, enrichers of the needy, Martyrs of the Lord, enrich my most miserable soul, lacking in virtues.

Senselessly Cain the slayer of his brother became insane with rage; you have appeared like him, my soul, by slaying yourself, not some one else, with the pleasures and deceptions of life.

****

Of the Martyrs.

The chosen pearls of the Lord, the precious vessels, the shining lamps, godly ray of grace, the Champions of Christ, let us, assembled together, fittingly honour.

Accepting the blood of the wise Champions above incense, O Word, at their prayers save those who fall down before you in repentance, as you alone are merciful.

On mount Sinai Moses saw you in the bush, who conceived unburned the fire of the Godhead in your womb; while Daniel saw you, an unhewn mountain, Isaias cried out that you budded forth the rod from David’s root.

****

Troparia.

Jacob took the birthright once through self-mastery, and Esau, who did not master his belly, surrendered his precedence; how wicked is indulgence, how great self-mastery; flee the imitation of wickedness, my soul, love the acquiring of goodness.

Because Job the blameless endured many things he was crowned, for though floods of trials raged round him they did not shake the tower of his heart; always rival him, my soul and stay unwounded by the devices of the evil one.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Hardened like steel by the fire of the divine Spirit, you clearly appeared as swords cutting down hostile regiments, O Champions of Christ, and great renowned for your victories, you were crowned by the all-powerful hand of the Sovereign of all.

Blameless multitude of the Martyrs, implore the Master and God, who accepted your limitless toils and numbered you with the armies of the Bodiless Powers, to wipe out the multitude of my wickednesses.

****

Light-filled palace of the Master, make me a house of light; gate through which none may pass, open to me the roads of repentance; holy Land, guide me to the land of the meek, show me to be free of all the power of the passions.

****

Aposticha of Lauds, of Compunction.

Gather my scattered mind, Lord, and cleanse my hardened heart, granting me repentance as to Peter, groans as to the Publican, tears as to the Harlot, that with a loud voice I may cry to You: Save me, O God, as alone compassionate and lover of mankind.

Many times as I come to the end of singing hymns I am found to be full of sin, for though I utter songs with my tongue, with my soul I think on foul things; but set both to rights, Christ God, through repentance and save me.

****

Come, all peoples, let us honour the memory of the holy Champions; for they became a spectacle to Angels and to men and received from Christ the crown of victory, and the intercede for our souls.
