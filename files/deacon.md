<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; color: red; mso-bidi-font-style: italic">After the Bishop has said the ekphonesis:</span>*<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"> </span>*<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">And the mercies of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, shall be with all of you, \[<span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">two Subdeacons take the candidate to the middle of the church, with one hand on his neck and with the other holding his hands; and they bow him as low as possible. One Deacon in the Sanctuary says</span> ** Give the order.<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference" style="mso-special-character:footnote">[1]</span></a> <span style="color:red">They bring the candidate forward and bow him down again; and another Deacon says: </span>Give the order. <span style="color:red;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">They bring him near the Holy Doors and bow him low before the Bishop, who is seated on his small throne in front of the Altar, slightly to the left. The Archdeacon says:</span> ** Give the order, Holy Master.\] <span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">Then two Deacons come from the Sanctuary and take the one who is to be ordained Deacon, who is standing on the Solea, and bring him into the Sanctuary, circling the Altar as they sing the following Troparia</span>\[<span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">, which are repeated by the Singers</span>\]*:*</span>

<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Isaias dance: the Virgin has conceived and given birth to a Son, Emmanuel, who is both God and man. Orient is his name, whom we magnify as we call the Virgin blessed.</span>

After this the Bishop orders him to be ungirded and the towel to be removed.

The Bishop signs his head three times, and when the Deacon has said </span>Let us pray to the Lord<span style="color:red">, the Bishop, with his hand on the head of the ordinand prays as follows in a low voice:</span>**</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Lord, our God, by your foreknowledge you send down the gift of your Holy Spirit upon those who are appointed by your inscrutable power to become ministers and to assist in the service of your most pure Mysteries. Keep this man also, Master, whom you have been well pleased to ordain through me to the ministry of the Diaconate, in all soberness, holding the mystery of faith with a pure conscience. Give him the grace which you gave to Stephen the Protomartyr, whom you also called first to the work of your service. Count him worthy to administer in accordance with what is well pleasing to you the rank that has been given him by your loving kindness Â— for those who have served well, gain for themselves a fair rank Â— and show him to be your perfect servant. For yours is the Kingdom and the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">God our Saviour, with your immortal voice you laid down for your Apostles the law of the Diaconate and declared the Protomartyr Stephen to be one, and proclaimed him the first to fulfil the work of the Deacon, as it is written in your Holy Gospel: Whoever wishes to be first among you, let him be your deacon. Master of all things, fill this servant of yours, whom you have counted worthy to enter upon the ministry of the Deacon, with all faith, love, power and sanctification by the indwelling of your holy and life-giving Spirit; for it is not by the laying on of my hands, but by the visitation of your rich acts of compassion that grace is given to your worthy ones, so that he, having become free of every sin, may take his stand before you without blame on the dread day of your judgement, and receive the unfailing reward of your promise. For you are our God, and to you we give glory, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and forever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">\[<span style="color:red;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Then the Bishop gives him the Cuffs, likewise saying:</span> ** Axios! <span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">And this is normally chanted three times by those in the Sanctuary, and three times by the Singers.</span>\]**</span>

<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; color: red; mso-bidi-font-style: italic">Then the Bishop gives him a Fan, likewise saying:</span>*<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"> </span>*<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Axios! ** \[<span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:

But when the ordination takes place at the Liturgy of the Presanctified, it is to be noted that after the Presanctified Gifts have been placed on the Holy Table, before the Deacon says:</span>*<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"> </span>*<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Let us complete our evening prayer to the Lord<span style="color:red">, the candidate is brought forward and the Ordination takes place as we have described.</span>**</span>

This is said twice in the plural and the third time in the singular, addressed to the Bishop. The latter is the exact equivalent of the Latin *Jube, Domne*, as in the old rite for Compline, *Jube, Domne, benedicere*. The meaning is really something like, Â‘If you pleaseÂ’, Â‘With your permissionÂ’. The same expression is used when a Bishop presides Vespers or a Vigil. The canonarch announces the Tone to be sung by saying to the Bishop, Â‘With your permission, holy Master, Tone *x*Â’. At an ordination the expression is, in effect, the request for the clergy, the people and the Bishop to give their consent to the candidateÂ’s ordination. The cry Â‘Axios!Â’, Â‘Worthy!Â’, occurs after the ordination has taken place.</span>
