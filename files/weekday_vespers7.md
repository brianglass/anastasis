ON SUNDAY EVENING

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **Prosomia of the Lord.**

Tone 6. Having placed all your hope. Ὅλην ἀποθέμενοι.

O Word, who do not desire the death of all, but the repentance of those who have sinned against you, most compassionate Christ and Lord, and who ever show mercy to me your servant, show me compassion as I repent and dare to ask pardon for the wicked deeds through which I have embittered you; for you will show in me the depth of your divine pity, if unworthy as I am, you save me as you love humankind.

Only lover of humankind, who wish all to be saved, and in compassion call those who have grieved you to repentance, do not, I beg, O Master, in any way remember the shame of the disordered deeds which I have done, alas! in your sight, without trembling, wretch that I am, at your inescapable hand; so now I fall before you, groaning and grieving, and in spirit clasping your feet to obtain pardon.

Accept my supplication, you who wish all to be saved, and do not cast from your presence me the unworthy who have much offended more than every human creature from my youth up; therefore with bended knee I fall before you in tears: Be compassionate, have mercy, show in me your mercies, O Lord of glory, Father of mercy and pities, do not reject me, the wretch who calls on you for help.

****

Others, of the Bodiless Powers, to the same melody.

Angelic choirs eternally sing to you a festive tune, O Supremely Good, as they clearly behold your fair beauty, and filled with the radiance, in no way carried by the inclination to ill, but rather ever unbendingly inclined to what is before, and eagerly receiving the all-blest rays, they intercede with boldness for our souls.

Build a wall around your flock with protecting Angels, who sustain their ranks by your word and will, so driving out every trial from barbarians and arrogance of heresies. For you truly purchased this flock of yours by your Blood, and wiped away the condemnation of law and sin, so that, delivered from the afflictions that now beset it, your flock with orthodox mind may magnify you, O Saviour.

Principalities, Dominions and Seraphim, with the Thrones, unsullied Cherubim, Angels, Archangels accompany with fear your revered and august throne and divine glory; while all the Powers with the Authorities honour your majesty, and your ineffable providence and marvel at your wisdom, O Christ, for all that exists, and with freedom to speak they intercede on behalf of our souls.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. Same melody.**

Having slipped and fallen by my own choice and by trickery become enslaved to the deceiver, wretch that I am, I take refuge in your wondrous compassion and fervent intercession, all-holy Maiden, Bride of God. Deliver from the bondage of trials and afflictions, and me, O All-unblemished, from the assaults of demons, that I may glorify you, and with love hymn, worship and magnify you, Sovereign Lady, ever-blessed.

****

Aposticha of Compunction.

I have not acquired repentance, nor yet again tears, therefore, O Saviour, I implore you, before the end turn and grant me repentance, that I may be delivered from damnation.

****

Verse 1.

To you I lift up my eyes, to you who are enthroned in the heavens. As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master: or as the eyes of a maid toward the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God: until he show us his mercy.

At your dread coming, O Christ, do not let us hear, ‘I do not know you’; for we have put our hope in you, the Saviour, even though we have not done your commands through our indifference: but spare our souls we beg.

****

Verse 2.

Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we have our fill of derision; our soul has its fill. Mockery for those at ease: and derision for the proud. ****

Of the Martyrs.

Your Martyrs, Lord, did not deny you, they did not abandon your commandments. At their prayers, have mercy on us.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Let us the faithful, like the Archangels, sing the praise of the heavenly bridal chamber, and the gate truly sealed. Hail, through whom the Saviour of all, Christ the giver of life and God, budded for us. Pure Sovereign Lady, cast down our tyrannous and godless foes by your power, O hope of Christians.

ON MONDAY EVENING

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **Prosomia of the Lord.**

Tone 6. Having placed all your hope.

From my youth I have been wholly enslaved to the pleasures of the flesh and have become a lodging of passions of the soul that tyrannise over me; while with total lack of reason, Saviour, I have despised your commandments. But do you, who fashioned me and know our weakness, who alone are without sin, give me pardon, O Compassionate, for the sins I have committed in ignorance and knowledge, in body and in mind from my youth, O only loving and most merciful.

Who will deliver me from the death of my miserable flesh and keep my soul from hurt and from temptation? For living in enjoyment the flesh holds sway with tyrannical force and rises in rebellion against the soul, and it afflicts it again and grows weak. Ah, wretch that I am! Therefore, my Saviour, I am unable to hold out against its weakness. But, my Maker, do not let my spirit be conquered by dust, that spirit which you breathed into as you were well-pleased.

When you wish to separate me from the bonds of the flesh by your command, then spare my soul, O Immortal, sending out a gentle Angel, looking like one bringing gladness, to take me up and save me from the rulers of darkness, easily empowering me to take a fair ascent in the air and to reach the worship of your dread throne uncondemned, O God supremely good.

****

Others, of the Forerunner.

Condemned by my life of a wastrel, I fall down before you, who are glorified beyond all accounting, and I implore you from the depth of my heart: See the affliction of my soul, you who outshone joy. See the sores of my heart, Herald of repentance, and grant me salvation through your godly intercession, O Forerunner, as you entreat the Lord.

Wholly condemned by wickedness, wholly drowned by despair, I am utterly evil and dark. I am wholly and utterly marked by unseemly pleasures; wholly and terribly ruined and ill-treated. I fall at your footprints, blessed John. Do not cast me away, but save me, friend and Forerunner of the Lord.

Deliver my soul from the bitter death of sin and faults, O Forerunner, and make me lives by the godly works of Christ’s commandments by the power of your intercessions. Put an end to wars that are invisibly waged against me, and guide my by the straight paths of saving and eternal rest by your entreaties to God.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. Having placed all your hope.**

Remembrance of wrongs is a sign of anger and temper is a manifestation of anger. Through them absurdities of insults shamelessly leap up from the wretched mouth, making the one who is activated by them liable to Gehenna’s fire, as it written. Therefore, soul, keep watch, flee bitter temper, anger, wrath and insolence and every foul-smelling excess, as you cry out to the Mother of God, ‘My Lady, save me!’

****

Aposticha of Compunction.

I have not gained repentance, nor again tears, therefore I implore you, O Saviour, before the end to turn me back and give me compunction, that I may be delivered from punishment.

At your dread Coming, O Christ, may we not hear, ‘I do not know you’, for we have put our hope in you, our Saviour, though we do not carry out your commands through our indifference. But spare our souls, we beg.

****

Of the Martyrs.

The Martyrs who bore witness for your sake, O Christ, endured many torments and received the perfect crown in heaven, that they may intercede for our souls.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

For the afflicted, transformation and liberation for the ailing are you, O Virgin Mother of our God; save your City, save us all. To those embattled you are peace; you are calm to those tossed by the tempest, the one Protection of the faithful.

<span style="text-transform: uppercase">on tuesday evening</span>

At

Lord, I have cried, **Prosomia of the Lord.**

Tone 6. Ἡ ἀπεγνωσμένη.

God, who wish that should be saved, look upon and see my prayer, and do no reject my tears as vain. For who ever approached you, falling down before you, and was not immediately saved? Who ever cried out fervently to you, and was not immediately heard? For you, Master and Lord are found swift to save all those who ask you, through your great mercy.

In your love for mankind, O Compassionate, raise me up, who have been swallowed down by sins and torn in pieces by love of pleasures. Do not let me become an object of malignant joy to demons. Do not dismiss me as unworthy of your dread mysteries. But accept me as you are merciful before the groans and tears of my departure, and free from the passions.

Lament, my soul, before your departure; fall down before the Creator in repentance; offer tears from your whole heart; cry out to Christ in compunction, ‘I have sinned against you, O Word, do not despise me, do not reject me, just Judge, nor send me away to fire, O Long-suffering, through your great mercy.’

****

Others, of the Mother of God. Having placed all your hope.

‘The marriage of the heavenly Bridegroom has been prepared’, cry the heralds. Why do you willingly delay, my black soul? Truly everything about is filthy, your garments are those of sensuality, and so how, wretch, are you going to enter? Come, fall down, crying out before the end to her who did not know wedlock, ‘Sprinkle me with the hyssop of your intercessions, pure Virgin, cleanse me and make me worthy of the bridal chamber, that I may magnify you.

With purity of mind, O holy, all-pure Virgin, Isaias foretold that you would give birth to the Maker of all creation. For you appeared from eternity as alone all-blameless. Therefore I beg you, purify my defiled heart, and make me a partaker in the divine radiance of your Son, O Maiden, and of a place at his right hand, when, as it is written, he takes his throne to judge the whole world.

The Harlot, when of old she emptied out the alabaster jar of sweet myrrh upon your feet, Master, was freed of all that she had done. The Thief was no sooner seen to remember you, than you led at once into Paradise. But what shall I do, wretch that I am? I have no sweet myrrh, no compunction. Have mercy on me freely, take pity on me, O Word, your immaculate Mother entreats, whom you have given to your world as a mighty refuge.

Glory. Both now.

**Cross-Theotokion. Same melody.**

‘The judges of Israel condemned you to a judgement that carried death with it, my Son, standing you, Saviour, who judge the dead and the living, before a tribunal as one to be judged; and they set you before Pilate and condemned you trial. Ah, the lawless ones! And as I see it, I am wounded and condemned with you, O Lord. Therefore I judge that to die is better than to live’ cried the Mother of God with groans, O only Merciful.

****

Aposticha, of the Cross.

Your Cross, Lord, is life and resurrection for your people, and trusting in it we sing your praise, our God who was crucified in the flesh. Have mercy on us.

Your Cross, Lord, opened Paradise to the human race, and freed from corruption we sing your praise, our God who was crucified in the flesh. Have mercy on us.

****

Of The Martyrs.

The Martyrs, Champions and citizens of heaven, having struggled on earth, endured many torments. At their intercessions and prayers, Lord, keep us all.

Glory. Both now.

**Cross-Theotokion.**

When she saw you crucified, O Christ, she who bore you cried out, ‘What is the strange mystery I see, my Son? How are you, the giver of life, hanged in the flesh, dying on a Tree?

<span style="text-transform: uppercase">on Wednesday evening</span>

****

At

Lord, I have cried **Stichera of the Apostles.**

Tone 6. Having placed all your hope.

Having received the heavenly power of the Paraclete, Christ’s Apostles routed the regiments of the foe. They rebuked kings, put the wise to shame, simple and unlettered, naked and unarmed they were drawn up in accordance with the Gospel. While they worked deeds of wonder by the word of grace. And so, making the nations obedient to Christ, they intercede with boldness on behalf of our souls.

Your glorious Disciples, yearning after you and denying themselves, fervently followed you. Taking up the Cross behind you, in obedience to your command, they left the earth behind and obtained heaven as their portion, turning the nations to the true knowledge of you. And now, having become your subjects through all things, they ever intercede with boldness on behalf of our souls.

I pass my whole in indifference, Lord supremely good, and have arrived fruitless before the end, wretch that I am, carrying only the burdens of evil deeds that are now hard to carry. Scatter them, Lover of mankind, with the weight of your mercy, and give me compunction and saving conversion, O God, at the acceptable and godly intercessions of your Apostles, whom I bring to intercede with her who bore you.

****

Others of St Nicolas. Τριήμερος ἀνέστης Χριστέ.

Blessed Nicolas, help me as I fall before you, and enlighten the eyes of my soul, wise Saint, that I may see clearly the Giver of light, the Compassionate Lord.

Enemies are seeking me out to do me evil, holy Hierarch. Rescue me, as you have freedom of approach to God, save me from harm and deliver me from men of bloodshed.

With faith we have now gained you, O Hierarch, as a haven without storms, an unbreachable wall, a tower of safety, a door of repentance and a faithful guide and champion.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. The same melody.**

The Virgin’s giving birth without travail has clearly become for us the greatest of gifts, for God makes new again our nature that was corrupted and refashions what is human.

****

Aposticha of the Apostles.

When your Disciples were storm-tossed in the boat, O Christ, they shouted out, ‘Teacher, save us, we are perishing!’ And now we cry aloud, ‘Saviour who love mankind, deliver us from our constraints, we beg.’

Lord, the Apostles once grasped the depth of the sea through nets, later the height of the Kingdom through teachings. By their skill they searched the depth that cannot be grasped, while by their faith they reached your bosom that cannot be circumscribed, and they proclaimed to the world your Son who is beyond time. At their intercessions and those all the Saints, have mercy on us.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Your Cross, Lord, became for your Martyrs an invincible weapon. For they saw the death that lay before them and looking forward to the life to come, they were given power by their hope in you. At their entreaties, have mercy on us.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Mother of God, you are the true vine who gave bud to the fruit of life. We implore you, ‘Intercede, Sovereign Lady, with the Apostles and all the Saints, that he have mercy on our souls’.

<span style="text-transform: uppercase">on thursday evening</span>

****

At

Lord, I have cried **Stichera of the Cross, Prosomia.**

Tone 6. You rose on the third day. Τριήμερος ἀνέστης Χριστέ.

My God, long-suffering, loving mankind, full of mercy and pitying, how did you endure slaughter and death on a Tree for the sake of the human race? We glorify your compassion.

You endured blows, crucifixion and abuse, O long-suffering and only Giver of life, wishing to redeem all from the hand of the deceiver, and you bear all things, O supremely Good.

As Shepherd you ascended the Cross and stretched out your hands, crying out, ‘Come to me and be enlightened, mortals darkened by deception. For I am light’. Glory to you, only Giver of light.

****

Others, of the Mother of God. Ἡ ἀπεγνωσμένη.

O Virgin, set upright my soul, bowed down and bent double by the heavy and unbearable weight of offences. For with your mother’s boldness you can easily persuade the Saviour who sets upright those who are broken down. And by your mediation tear up the record of my sins through your great mercy.

See one who is condemned by sins, ruined by iniquities and who has despised the commands of God, and do not cast me from your presence. For you, Mother of God, are my hope and defence. Therefore by your intercessions attend to me, cleanse me of every stain through your great mercy.

Open to me the door of repentance, All-holy Virgin. Give me a fount of tears, grant me compunction and a temperate heart, for I name you my only sure defence. I place on you all my expectation. Do not reject me in my shame, but accept me and save me, Sovereign Lady, through your great mercy.

Glory. Both now.

**Cross-Theotokion. You rose on the third day.**

The all-pure Virgin, seeing you nailed to the Tree, cried aloud, ‘My Son and God, what is this strange and marvellous report of you that you endure through your great pity?’

****

Aposticha of the Cross.

Your Cross, O Lord, is life and assistance for your people. And trusting in it we sing your praise, our God crucified in the flesh. Have mercy on us.

Your Cross, O Lord, has opened Paradise to the human race. And saved from corruption we sing your praise, our God crucified in the flesh. Have mercy on us.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Your Martyrs, O Lord, did not deny you, they did not desert your commandments. At their prayers have mercy on us.

Glory. Both now.

**Cross-Theotokion. Τριήμερος ἀνέστης Χριστέ.**

The Virgin once stood with the virgin Disciple by the Tree at the time of the crucifixion and weeping she cried out, ‘Alas, how you suffer all things, O Christ who are dispassion!’

ON FRIDAY EVENING

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **Prosomia of the Lord.**

Tone 6. Ἡ ἀπεγνωσμένη.

Deliver me from Gehenna that awaits me, Judge most just, take me, who am condemned, from the everlasting fire, show me, O Word, to be impregnable to the hostile tempest. Wretch that I am, I tremble when I consider the multitude of my faults, and I fall before you with tears and a broken heart as I ask your mercy.

Who would not weep for me, who have transgressed my Master’s commandment through lack of self-mastery; who dwell in Hades instead of Paradise? Food that seemed to me sweet was turned to gall. I have been shown to be a stranger to your glory, O Compassionate, and to the Angels. But make me repentant, as you are a Lord who is merciful and compassionate because of your great mercy.

Giver of life, set all those who have fallen asleep in faith in the land of the living, in places of repose, in eternal dwellings, where the light of your face shines out ungrudgingly, where the delight and joy and peace of the Righteous are found, overlooking all their faults in deed, word and thought, Master, through your great goodness.

****

Others, of the Martyrs. Automela.

Those who bore witness to you, O Christ, endured many torments, and received the crown of perfection in heaven, that they might intercede on behalf of our souls.

The Martyrs, champions and citizens of heaven, endured many torments as they struggled on earth. At their prayers and entreaties, Lord, protect us all.

Your Cross, Lord, became an invincible weapon for the Martyrs. For they saw the death that awaited them and looking to the life to come they were empowered by their hope in you. At their intercessions have mercy on us.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Who will not call you blessed, All-holy Virgin? Who will not sing the praise of your child-birth without labour? For the only-begotten Son, who shone from the Father beyond time, came forth from you, pure Maiden, ineffably incarnate. By nature he is God, by nature he became man for our sakes, not divided in a duality of persons, but known without confusion in a duality of natures. O honoured and all-blessed, implore him to have mercy on our souls.

****

Aposticha.

Your Martyrs, Lord, did not deny you, they did not abandon your commandments. At their prayers, have mercy on us.

****

Of the Dead.

Verse:

Blessed are those whom you have chosen and taken, O Lord.

Your command, which fashioned me, was my beginning and my substance; for wishing to compose me as a living creature from visible and invisible natures, you moulded my body from the earth, but gave me a soul by your divine and life-giving breath. Therefore, O Christ, give rest to your servant in the land of the living, in the tents of the righteous.

****

Verse:

Their souls shall dwell among good things.

Tasting of the tree in Eden of old decreed pain for Adam, when a serpent vomited poison, for through it death entered and devoured the whole human race. But the Master came, destroyed the dragon and granted us resurrection. To him let us cry, ‘Saviour, spare too those whom you have taken, and give them rest with the Just’.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

At the prayers of her who gave you birth, O Christ, those of your Martyrs, Apostles, Prophets, Hierarchs, Venerable and Righteous ones, and all your Saints, give rest to your servants who have fallen asleep.
