NOTE ON THE READINGS

The Readings for Vespers are not straightforward passages from the
Wisdom books. They cannot, therefore, be simply read from an English
version of the Old Testament, even one made from the Septuagint. For
example the first reading [ is taken from Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and
lastly Wisdom, hence the title. The opening part of the text speaks both
of Â‘a manÂ’ Â— *aner* not *anthropos* Â— and Â‘\[the\] wiseÂ’, or
Â‘\[the\] justÂ’, in the plural.

in these texts, the feminine has been retained in the translation,
without prejudice,  as the lawyers
say.]{style="font-family: Book Antiqua"}
