Commemoration of our Father among the Saints, Nicolas, Archbishop of Myra in Lycia, the Wonderworker.

AT GREAT VESPERS

****

The 1st Section of

Blessed is the man. ****

At,

Lord, I have cried, **we insert 6 \[at a Vigil 8\] Prosomia.**

Tone 2. When from the Tree.

Bodily you dwelt in Myra, but anointed with spiritual myrrh you were revealed truly to be myrrh, Holy Nicolas, High Priest of Christ; and with myrrh you make fragrant the faces of those who with faith and love ever celebrate your most revered memory, as you free them, Father, from disasters, dangers and afflictions by your prayers to the Lord.

Truly you have been revealed, like your name, as a mighty Victory \[

Niki\] of the faithful People \[Laos\] in trials, Holy Nicolas, true servant of Christ; for invoked everywhere you come swiftly to help those who with love take refuge under your protection; for appearing night and day by faith, you save them from trials and calamities.

You appeared to the Emperor Constantine with Avlavios in a dream, and filling them with fear, you spoke to them like this, ‘Free from imprisonment at once those whom you unjustly hold in chains, for they are innocent of lawless murder. But if, Majesty, you disobey, I will make entreaty against you by beseeching the Lord.’

Holy Nicolas, sacred herald of Christ, you are a great and fervent helper for those in dangers, those on land and those who sail, those far off and those nearby, a most compassionate and mighty intercessor. Therefore assembled together we cry, ‘Intercede to the Lord that we may be rescued from every calamity’.

****

Other Prosomia. Same Tone.
With what garlands of praise.

With what garlands of praise may I bind the brow of the High Priest? In body he was in Myra, in spirit he comes to all who sincerely love him; the comfort of the afflicted, refuge of all in dangers, tower of true religion, champion of the faithful; the one through whom the arrogance of the ill-intentioned was cast down by Christ who has great mercy.

With what harmonious songs may we praise the High Priest? Opponent of impiety, champion of orthodoxy; defender of the Church; the great warrior and teacher; the one who put to shame all the heretics; the destroyer of Arius and fervent fighter; the one through whom the arrogance of the ill-intentioned was cast down by Christ who has great mercy.

With what prophetic songs may we praise the High Priest? who saw beforehand things far off, and proclaimed them clearly in advance, describing them as though present; rescuing all those unjustly treated; appearing in a dream to the King, inspired by God, and delivering from unjust slaughter those before in chains, enriching them with God’s great mercy.

Glory.

**Tone 6.**

Lovers of feasts, let us assemble and with songs of praise hymn the ornament of Hierarchs, the glory of the Fathers, the fount of wonders and greatest helper of believers, as we say, Hail guard, august leader and immovable pillar of the people of Myra. Hail brightly shining beacon, who irradiate with your wonders all the ends of the earth. Hail divine joy of the afflicted, and most fervent defender of the wronged. And now, all-blessed Nicolas, do not cease to intercede with Christ God on behalf of those who ever honour with faith and love your joyous and all-festive memory.

Both now.

**Pre-festal. The same Tone.**

Cave, make ready; for the Ewe-lamb has come, bearing Christ in her womb. Manger, receive the One who by a word frees us who are born of earth from irrational action. Shepherds abiding in the fields, bear witness to the fearful wonder; and Magi from Persia, offer gold, frankincense and myrrh to the King; because the Lord has appeared from a Virgin Mother. Bowing low like a slave his Mother worshipped him, and cried out to the One in her arms, ‘How were you sown in me, or how did you grow within me, my Redeemer and my God?’

****

Entrance.

O Joyful Light, **the Prokeimenon of the day and the Readings.**

The Reading is from Proverbs.
\[

**10:7; 3:13-16 & selection**\]

The memory of the just is with praises, and the Lord’s blessing of is upon his head. Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the mortal who knows understanding. For it is better to trade for her than for treasures of gold or silver. She is more precious than valuable stones; nothing evil can stand against her; she is well known to all who draw near her; nothing precious matches her worth. From her mouth comes justice, she bears law and mercy on her tongue. Therefore listen to me, my children, for I shall speak noble things; and blessed is the one who will keep my ways. For my issues are issues of life, and favour is prepared by the Lord. Therefore I beseech you and utter my voice to the children of mankind. Because I, Wisdom, have prepared counsel and knowledge and I have called upon understanding. Counsel and assurance are mine, understanding is mine, strength is mine. I love those who are my friends, while those who seek me will find grace. And so you simple folk understand subtlety, you untaught lay it to heart. Hearken to me again, for I shall speak noble things, and I shall open my mouth to speak things that are right. Because my throat will meditate truth, but lying lips are abominations before me. All the words of my mouth are with justice; there is nothing twisted in them or crooked. They are all straight to those who understand, and right to those that find knowledge. For I teach you what is true, that your hope may be in the Lord, and you may be filled with Spirit.

The Reading is from Proverbs.
\[

**10:31-32 & 11:1-12**\]

The mouth of the just drops wisdom; but the tongue of the unjust will be cut out. The lips of just men know graces; but the mouth of the impious is turned away. A false balance is an abomination before the Lord; but a just weight is acceptable to him. Wherever pride enters, there too dishonour; but the mouth of the humble meditates wisdom. The perfection of the upright will guide them, but the crookedness of the treacherous will carry them off. Possessions do not profit in the day of wrath, but justice will deliver from death. When a just man dies he leaves regret; ready and welcome is the destruction of the ungodly. The justice of the blameless keeps their ways straight, but impiety falls in with injustice. The justice of upright men will deliver them, but transgressors are caught by base counsel. When a just man dies his hope does not perish; but the boast of ungodly people perishes. A just man escapes from the hunt, but the ungodly is given up in his place. In the mouth of the ungodly people is a snare for citizens, but the perception of the just brings prosperity. By the good things of the just a city is successful, and in the loss of the ungodly there is gladness. By the blessing of the upright a city will be exalted, but by the mouth of the ungodly it will be overthrown. One who lacks sense sneer at their fellow citizens, an intelligent man practices stillness.

The Reading is from the Wisdom of Solomon.
\[

**4:7-15**\]

The just, though he die early, will be at rest. For old age is not honoured for length of time, or measured by the number of years; but understanding is grey hair for humans, and a blameless life is ripe old age. Being pleasing to God he was loved by him, and while living among sinners he was taken up. He was snatched away lest evil change his understanding, or trickery deceive his soul. For the fascination of wickedness obscures the good, and roving desire perverts the innocent mind. Though perfected in a short time he fulfilled long years; for his soul was pleasing to the Lord, and so he took him quickly from the midst of evil. Yet the peoples saw and did not understand, nor take such a thing to heart, that grace and mercy are with his holy ones and his visitation with his chosen ones.

****

At the Liti we sing Idiomels.
Tone 1.

You fixed your gaze unflinchingly on the height of knowledge and inscrutably contemplated the depth of wisdom, Father. Ever beseech Christ for us, Hierarch Nicolas.

****

Same tone.

Man of God and faithful servant and steward of his mysteries, and man of the desires of the Spirit, living monument and breathing image, with wondering admiration the Church of Myra has received you as a divine treasure and intercessor for our souls.

****

Tone 2.

As a rule of faith and image of meekness Christ God revealed you to your flock, Hierarch Nicolas; for in Myra you give off the fragrance of sweet myrrh and shine radiantly by your achievements, defender of orphans and widows; and so do not cease to intercede that our souls may be saved.

****

Same Tone. Tone 6.

Well done, good and faithful servant; well done, worker in the vineyard of Christ, for you bore the heat of the day, you increased the talent given you and did not envy those who came after you. And so heaven’s gate has opened for you; enter into the joy of your Lord, and intercede for us, Holy Nicolas.

****

At the Aposticha. Prosomia. Tone 5. Hail, of ascetics.

Hail, sacred head; the pure dwelling of the virtues, the godly rule of the most godly priesthood, most manifest great Shepherd, the torch of Victory whose name you bear; who bend with compassion towards those who ask, who incline to the prayers of the weak; most ready deliverer, the saving guardian of all those who with faith celebrate your all-revered memory. Implore Christ, O All-blessed, to send down his great mercy.

****

Verse:

Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his holy one.

Hail, most sacred mind; the pure lodging of the Trinity; the pillar of the Church; the support of believers; the help of the storm-tossed; star, who by the beams of your acceptable supplications ever scatter the darkness of trials and tribulations, High Priest Nicolas; calmest of harbours, in which those who are beset by the billows of life find safety. Implore Christ to grant our souls his great mercy.

****

Verse:

Your priests, Lord, will clothe themselves with justice, and your holy ones will rejoice.

Hail, Nicolas, who filled with godlike zeal by fearsome intervention and visitations through dreams rescued from evil arrest those who were about to die unjustly. Fount, who became a rich fount of fragrant myrrh for those in Myra, and watered their souls, driving away the foul stench of the passions. Sword, which cut down the cockle of error. Winnowing fan that sifted the doctrines of Arius like chaff. Implore Christ to send down to our souls his great mercy.

Glory.

**Tone 6.**

Man of God and faithful servant, minister of the Lord, man of desires, vessel of election, pillar and support of the Church, heir to the Kingdom, do not cease to cry out on our behalf to the Lord.

Both now.

**Prefestal. Tone 6.**

Virgin without bridegroom, where have you come from? Who begot you? And who is your mother? How do you carry the Creator in your arms? How was your womb not corrupted? We see great marvels have come to pass on earth, All-holy, and we make ready in advance that which fits your need: the Cave from the earth; and we ask heaven to provide the Star; and Magi are advancing from the eastern regions of the earth towards the west, to look on the salvation of mortals being suckled as a babe.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 4.

The truth of your actions proclaimed you to your flock as a rule of faith, an image of meekness and a teacher of self-control; and so you gained through humility the things on high, through poverty riches, O Father and High Priest Nicolas; intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.

****

Theotokion.

The mystery hidden from all eternity and unknown to Angels has been revealed to those on earth through you, O Mother of God: God being made flesh in a union without confusion and willingly accepting the Cross for us, through which he raised the first-formed man and saved our souls from death.

****

And Dismissal.
