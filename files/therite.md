THE RITE
========

1
-

The Procession of the relics and the entrance into the church

****

The Priest takes the kairos and does the Proskomidi. The Bishop goes to the Church in which the holy relics have been placed. There he vests in all his pontifical vestments and gives the blessing.

Bishop

Blessed is our God, always now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

Reader:

Amen. ****

And they begin Psalm 142.

Psalm 142

Lord, hear my prayer. In your truth give ear to my supplication, and in your justice hear me. Do not enter into judgement with your servant, for in your sight no one living can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul, humbled my life to the ground, made me dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit within me was despondent, and my heart was troubled within me. I remembered days of old, I meditated on all your works. On the works of your hands I would meditate. I stretched out my hands towards you. For you my soul was like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord; my spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I should walk, Lord, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord; I have fled to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land. For your name’s sake, O Lord, you will make me live. In your justice, you will bring my soul out of affliction, slay my enemies in your mercy and destroy all those that afflict my soul, for I am your servant.

****

Then the little Litany by the Deacon.

Deacon:

Again and again in peace, let us pray to the Lord. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

Deacon:

Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by your grace. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

Deacon:

Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most blessed and glorious Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, with all the Saints, let us entrust ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God. ****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

Ekphonesis by the Bishop.

For you, our God, are holy, and to you we give glory, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

Prayer, said by the Bishop.

L

ord our God, who are faithful in your words and without deceit in your promises, who gave your holy Martyrs the grace to fight the good fight, to finish the course of true religion and to keep the faith of the true confession, be entreated, all-holy Master, by their intercessions and give to us, your unworthy servants, the grace of a part and inheritance with them, so that, becoming imitators of them, we may be found worthy of the good things laid up for them. ****

Ekphonesis.

By the mercy and love for humankind of your only-begotten Son, with whom you are blessed, together with your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

Bishop:

Peace to all. ****

People:

And to your spirit. ****

Deacon:

Let us bow our heads to the Lord. ****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

The Bishop says the following prayer in a low voice.

L

ord our God, at the intercessions of our holy Lady, Mother of God, and of all your Saints, direct the works of the hands of us, your unworthy servants, and make us worthy to be well-pleasing to your goodness. ****

Ekphonesis.

Blessed and glorified be the might of your kingdom, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

After the ekphonesis the Bishop orders that the divine Liturgy take place in the Church in which the sacred Relics had been placed. Then he raises them, with the Paten, on his head and, with the Priests and Clerics going ahead with the holy Gospels and accompanied by the people with lighted lamps, they are brought in procession to the Church that is about to be dedicated, while the following troparia are chanted.

Tone 7.

Holy Martyrs, who fought the good fight and were crowned, intercede with the Lord to have mercy on our souls.

Glory to you, Christ God, boast of Apostles, joy of Martyrs whose preaching was the consubstantial Trinity.

****

The Bishop leaves the Church, as do all the People, and no one remains inside except for one cleric or lay person, who shuts the outer doors from inside. The Bishop processes in a circle round the Church that is being dedicated while the following Idiomels are sung.

Tone 1. By Monk John.

Be renewed, be dedicated, O new Jerusalem; for the glory and light of the Lord have risen upon you. For the Father has built this house; the Son has established this house; the Holy Spirit has renewed this house, the Spirit which enlightens and strengthens and sanctifies our souls.

****

The same tone. By Anatolios.

Of old when Solomon dedicated the temple he offered you, Lord, sacrifices and holocausts of irrational beasts; but when you were well-pleased, O Saviour, to put an end to types and to make known the truth, the ends of the earth offer to your glory sacrifices without shedding of blood, for you are Master of all things and you make all things holy by the Holy Spirit.

****

Tone 6.

For dedication to be honoured is an old law, and it is good; but rather should what is new be honoured through dedication, for islands are dedicated to God, as Isaias says, which are to be understood as the Churches from the nations, which have lately been established and received stability fixed on God. Therefore let us too celebrate spiritually the festival of the present Dedication.

Glory. Both now

***.* Tone 5.**

O Word, who rest in the bosom of the Father, send down your Holy Spirit on the Church which has been raised up to your name.

****

When the Bishop arrives before the main doors of the Church, from which he had set out for the first circuit of the Church, he places the sacred Relics on a table that has been put ready, and the Deacon at once reads the Apostle.

Prokeimenon. \[Psalm 26,1\]

The Lord is my enlightenment and my Saviour, whom shall I fear?

****

verse:

The Lord is the defender of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?

The Reading is from the Epistle of Paul to the Hebrews.

****

\[2:11-18\]

B

rethren, the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from One. For this reason he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, ‘I will proclaim your name to my brethren, in the midst of the church I will praise you’. And again, ‘I will put my trust in him’. And again, ‘Here am I, and children whom God has given me’. Since, therefore, the children share flesh and blood, he himself likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is the devil, and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. For it is clear he did not take on himself the nature of Angels, but he took on that of the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to become like his brethren in every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make atonement for the sins of the people. For because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being tested.

Alleluia.

**\[Psalm 54,17\]**

Verse:

I cried to the Lord, and God heard me. ****

Deacon:

Wisdom. Stand upright. Let us listen to the holy Gospel. ****

Bishop:

Peace to all. ****

People:

And to your spirit. ****

The Bishop reads the Gospel.

The Reading is from the holy Gospel according to John.

****

People:

Glory to you, Lord! Glory to you! ****

Deacon:

Let us attend. ****

\[16,13-19\]

A

t that time, when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, ‘Who do people say that I, the Son of Man, am?’ And they said, ‘Some say John the Baptist, but others Elias, and still others Jeremias or one of the prophets.’ He said to them, ‘But who do you say that I am?’ Simon Peter answered, ‘You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.’ And Jesus answered him, ‘Blessed are you, Simon bar Jonas! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.’ ****

People:

Glory to you, Lord! Glory to you! ****

Once again the Bishop takes the holy Relics on his head and processes around the Church with the Clergy and the People, while the 3rd Ode of the Canon of the Dedication is chanted.

Ode 3.

Your Church, O Christ, rejoices in you.

With the Spirit you have sanctified your Church on earth, O Christ, by anointing her with the oil of your gladness..

The Church, which has you as her unshaken foundation, O Christ, is today crowned with the Cross as with a royal diadem.

O loving Lord, you have shown today that the tabernacle made with hands is, by your dispensation, the dwelling of your glory which is beyond understanding.

****

Theotokion.

You alone, O Mother of God, have become the agent of supernatural blessings for those on earth; therefore we offer you our ‘Hail!’

****

When he arrives once again before the doors of the Church, he places the holy Relics on the table and the Apostle is read by the Deacon.

Prokeimenon. \[Psalm 44,16\]

Virgins in her train will be brought to the King.

****

Verse:

Those near her will be brought to you.

The Reading is from the Epistle of Paul to the Hebrews.

****

\[9,1-7\]

B

rethren, the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary. For a tent was constructed, the first one, in which were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the Presence; this is called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was a tent called the Holy of Holies. In it stood the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which there were a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant; above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot speak now in detail. Such preparations having been made, the priests go continually into the first tent to carry out their ritual duties; but only the high priest goes into the second, and he but once a year, and not without taking the blood that he offers for himself and for the sins committed in ignorance by the people.

Alleluia.

**Tone 3. \[Psalm 44,12\]**

Verse:

Listen my daughter and see, and incline your ear, and forget your people and your father’s house. ****

Deacon:

Wisdom. Stand upright. Let us listen to the holy Gospel. ****

Bishop:

Peace to all. ****

People:

And to your spirit. ****

The Bishop reads the Gospel.

The Reading is from the holy Gospel according to Luke.

****

People:

Glory to you, Lord! Glory to you! ****

Deacon:

Let us attend. ****

\[10,38-42 & 11,27-28\]

A

t that time, Jesus entered a village; and a woman named Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Jesus’ feet and listened to his word. But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said, ‘Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.’ But Jesus answered her, ‘Martha, Martha, you are anxious and fret about many things; one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which shall not be taken away from her.’ As he said this, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, ‘Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts that you sucked!’ But he said, ‘Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!’ ****

People:

Glory to you, Lord! Glory to you! ****

the Bishop takes the holy Relics on his head a third time and processes around the Church with the Clergy and the People, while the 6th Ode of the Canon of the Dedication is chanted.

Ode 6.

I will sacrifice to you with a voice of praise.

Christ the King has now desired the beauty of the holy Church, and revealed her as mother of the nations, through the Spirit adopted from slavery as children.

The ranks of hostile demons tremble before the Church of Christ, signed with mark of the Cross; and the sanctifying radiance of the Spirit overshadows her.

The Church from the nations, does not have sand but Christ as her foundation, is crowned with the unapproachable beauty, and adorned with the diadem of the Kingdom.

****

Theotokion.

O wonder, newer than all wonders! For a Virgin who did not know man conceived in the womb him who controls all things, yet he was not circumscribed.

****

When he reaches the doors of the Church for the last time, the Bishop exclaims with a loud voice:

Blessed are you, Christ our God, to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Then the following Troparion is sung in Tone 3.

Christ God, who founded your Church on the rock of the faith, direct our entreaties in it and accept a people that cries out to you, ‘Save us, our God!’

****

While the above Troparion is being chanted, the Bishop places the holy Relics on the table and, when the Troparion is finished, the Deacon exclaims:

Let us pray to the Lord.

****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

The Bishop says the following Prayer.

G

od and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who are blessed to the ages, who, through the veil of his flesh, dedicated for us anew the entry into the Church of the ancestors whose names are written in heaven, where there is the pure sound of those who feast and a voice of gladness, do you, Master, lover of mankind, look on us sinners and your unworthy servants, who perform the dedication of the honoured Church of **N.**, as a symbol of your most holy Church, that is of our bodily tabernacle, which, through the all-praised Apostle Paul, you vouchsafed to call your temple and the limbs of your Christ. Make it firm until the consummation of the age, unshaken and glorified by you, and count us worthy to offer hymns of praise and glory in it without condemnation to your glory and to your only-begotten Son and your Holy Spirit, with knowledge and full sense, and, as we worship you in fear of you, to be found worthy of your divine acts of pity, and that these supplications of ours, which we offer to your ineffable compassion for us and for all your People, may be acceptable to your goodness. At the prayers of our immaculate Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary. ****

Aloud.

For holy are you, our God, and you among the Saints, and to you we give glory, to the Father, the Son and the holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

Immediately the Deacon says:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

The Bishop, in a low voice, says the Prayer of The Entrance.

M

aster, Lord our God, you have set orders and armies of Angels and Archangels in heaven to minister to your glory; grant that, with our entrance, holy Angels may enter, concelebrating with us, and with us glorifying your goodness. ****

Aloud

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

After this, the doors of the Church still being shut, the Bishop and the Singers with the clerics chant the following.

Tone 6. \[Psalm 23\]

L

ift up your gates you rulers; and be lifted up you eternal gates, and the king of glory will enter. ****

from inside the Church and behind the closed doors some one stands and answers.

Who is this king of glory?

****

Those outside reply.

T

he Lord mighty and powerful, the Lord powerful in war. Lift up your gates you rulers; and be lifted up you eternal gates, and the king of glory will enter. ****

The questions in reply are taken up again as follows.

Those inside.

Who is this king of glory?

****

And those outside.

T

he Lord mighty and powerful, the Lord powerful in war. Lift up your gates you rulers; and be lifted up you eternal gates, and the king of glory will enter. ****

Those inside.

Who is this king of glory?

****

Those outside.

T

he Lord of powers, he is the king of glory. ****

At the third answer the Bishop once again lifts the holy Relics from the table and makes the sign of the Cross with them three times on the closed doors. And as soon as the third answer is completed, he pushes the closed doors. When they have been opened, the Bishop enters the Church, with the Clergy and the Singers, and with them the whole People, as the Apolytikion is chanted.

Tone 4.

As the beauty of the firmament above, O Lord, you have displayed the loveliness of the holy Dwelling of your glory below. Strengthen it to age on age and accept, through the Mother of God, our supplications which are offered in it without ceasing to you, the Life and Resurrection of all.

****

The Bishop and the Priests enter the holy Sanctuary. The holy Relics are placed in the box prepared for them and holy Myron is poured over them three times, while the Bishop intones.

Eternal the memory of the Founders of this holy House.

****

The People answer.

Eternal memory.

****

The Bishop, with great care, secures the holy Relics in the silver box and places it in the bottom of the hollow in the column of the holy Table, called the ‘stem’.

Then

2
-

THE SEALING OF THE RELICS INTO THE HOLY TABLE
---------------------------------------------

**Deacon:** Let us pray to the Lord.

****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

The Bishop offers the Prayers distinctly.

First Prayer.

L

ord our God, who granted this glory to the holy Martyrs who struggled for your sake, that their Relics be sown in the whole world, in your holy Houses, and to sprout fruits of healings, do you, Master, who are the giver of all good things, at the prayers of your Saints **N. & M***.*, whose relics you have been well-pleased to be placed in your honoured House, count us worthy without condemnation to offer the sacrifice without shedding of blood. And grant us all our requests that are for salvation, bestowing in return to those who struggled for the sake of your holy name to work marvels through them for our salvation. ****

Ekphonesis.

For yours is the Kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

Second Prayer.

L

ord God, our Saviour, who do and direct all things for the salvation of the human race, accept the entreaties of your unworthy servants for them to perform without condemnation the Dedication of this Church, that has been built for our salvation and the praise of your glory, in the name of Saint **N.**, and to make the installation of the Table in it. ****

Aloud

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

And after the

Amen **they bring and pour the wax-mastic in the middle of the ‘stem’, arrange the papers, take up the slab and place it on the pillar. While all this is being done the Singers chant:**

Psalm 144.

I will exalt you, my God, my King; and I will bless your name for ever and to age on age. Every day I will bless you, and I will praise your name for ever and to age on age. The Lord is great and highly to be praised, and there is no limit to his greatness. Generation after generation will praise your works, and will declare your power. They will tell of the majesty of the glory of your holiness, and will recount your wonders. They will speak of the power of your dread deeds, and will recount your greatness. They will proclaim the memory of the multitude of your goodness, and rejoice at your justice. The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy. The Lord is good to all, and his acts of compassion are for all his works. May all your works confess you, Lord, and all your holy ones bless you. They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, they will tell of your power. To make known your power to the children of humankind, the glory the majesty of your kingdom. Your kingdom is a kingdom for all the ages, and your dominion for every generation. The Lord is faithful in all his words, and holy in all his works. The Lord supports all who are falling, and sets upright all who are broken down. The eyes of all hope in you, and you give them their food in due season. You open your hand, and fill every living thing with your good pleasure. The Lord is just in all his ways, and holy in all his works. The Lord is close to those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. He will do the will of those who fear him, and will hear their supplication and save them. The Lord guards all who love him, and all sinners he will destroy. My mouth will tell the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and to age on age.

****

While the wax-mastic that has overflowed is being scraped up and the place, on which flowed, is being cleaned, the Singers chant:

Psalm 22.

The Lord shepherds me, and I will lack nothing. On a place of green pasture he has settled me, by refreshing water he has raised me. He has turned my soul back, he has guided me on paths of justice, for his name’s sake. For even if I walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will not fear evils, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff have comforted me. You have prepared a table before me, in the face of those who afflict me. You have anointed my head with oil, and your cup inebriates me because it is most potent. And your mercy will pursue me all the days of my life, and my dwelling will be in the house of the Lord to length of days.

-

THE ‘BAPTISM’ OF THE HOLY TABLE
-------------------------------

**Then the Bishop exclaims:**

Blessed is our God, always now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People.

Amen.

****

And they immediately bring the white garment

**and wrap it round the Bishop over his pontifical vestments, in front from his chest to his feet, but behind from the armholes to the waist, it is brought through the two ends and tied with a belt, so that the pontifical vestments are not visible. Two new cloths are wrapped round his arms and also tied with a belt. While the Bishop is being dressed like this, a prayer mat is placed before the holy Doors.**

Some Bishops wear a long white tunic over their vestments, tied round at the wrists like a sticharion.

Then the Deacon says:

Again and again on bended knees let us pray to the Lord.

****

People:

Lord, have mercy.

****

The Bishop, kneeling and facing the East, prays as follows:

G

od without beginning and eternal, who brought all things out of nothing into being, who dwell in unapproachable light, who have heaven as your throne, earth as your footstool, you gave Moses commandment and model, placed in Beseleêl a spirit of wisdom and made them able to complete the Tabernacle of Witness, in which were the ordinances of worship, the images and patterns of the truth. To Solomon you granted breadth and largeness of heart and through him you raised up the Temple of old. For your holy and all-praised Apostles you dedicated anew worship in Spirit and the grace of the true Tabernacle, and through them you planted in all the world your holy Churches and altars, O Lord of powers, for sacred sacrifices without shedding of blood to be offered you. Now you have been well-pleased for this Church also to be built in the name of Saint **N.** to your glory and that of your only-begotten Son and the Holy Spirit. Immortal and bountiful King, remember your acts of compassion and mercy, for they are from all time, and do not abhor us, befouled as we are with a multitude of sins, do not profane your covenant because of our uncleanness, but disregard our offences, give us strength and ability by the grace and visitation of your holy and life-giving Spirit, to accomplish without condemnation the dedication of this Church and to effect the consecration of the Altar within it, so that, blessing you in it with psalms and hymns and spiritual liturgies, we may at all times magnify your compassion. Yes, Master, Lord, God our Saviour, the hope of all the ends of the earth, hear us sinners as we entreat you, and send down your all-holy, worshipful and all-powerful Spirit and sanctify this House. Fill it with unending light; choose it for your dwelling; make it a tabernacle of your glory; adorn it with your divine and supernatural gifts of grace; set it as a haven for the storm-tossed, a place of healing for the passions, a refuge for the weak, a place that puts demons to flight. Let your eyes be open to it by day and night and your ears attentive to the supplication of those who enter it with fear of you and with devotion, and who call upon your all-honoured and worshipful name. Whatever they ask of you, you will hear in heaven above, show mercy and be gracious to them. Keep it unshaken until the consummation of the age and declare the Altar within it to be a Holy of Holies by the power and operation of your Holy Spirit. Glorify it more than the Mercy Seat under the law, so that the sacred rites performed on it may reach your holy and spiritual altar above the heavens and bring us the grace of your most pure overshadowing. For we take courage, not in the work of our unworthy hands, but in your ineffable loving-kindness. ****

Deacon:

Help us, save us, have mercy on us, raise us up and keep us, O God, by your grace. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. **And so after each petition.**

Deacon:

In peace, let us pray to the Lord.

For the peace from on high and for the salvation of our souls, let us pray to the Lord.

For the peace of the whole world, for the welfare of the holy Churches of God, and for the union of all, let us pray to the Lord.

For this holy house, and for those who enter it with faith, reverence and the fear of God, let us pray to the Lord.

For all devout and Orthodox Christians, let us pray to the Lord.

For our Archbishop

**N.**, for the honoured order of presbyters, for the diaconate in Christ, for all the clergy and the people, let us pray to the Lord.

\[For our Sovereign Lady, Queen Elizabeth, the Royal Family, her Government, and all in authority, let us pray to the Lord.\]

For the work of our hands and of our brothers and sisters who are with us, let us pray to the Lord.

For this House and the Altar within it to be made holy by the visitation, power and operation of the Holy Spirit, let us pray to the Lord.

For this city\], for every city, town and village, and for the faithful who dwell in them, let us pray to the Lord.

For those who travel by land, air or water, for the sick, the suffering, for those in captivity, and for their safety and salvation, let us pray to the Lord.

For our deliverance from all affliction, wrath, danger and constraint, let us pray to the Lord.

Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by your grace.

Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most blessed and glorious Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, with all the Saints, let us entrust ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God.

****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

And the Ekphonesis.

For holy are you, our God and you rest among the holy and honoured Martyrs who struggled for your sake, and to you we give glory, the father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

Then the Bishop goes in front of the holy Table and taking the pieces of soap makes the sign of the precious Cross with them from both sides and throws them on the holy Table in the form of a Cross. And they bring the buckets, that is the vessels of holy Baptism, filled with warm water.

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

The Bishop, bowing his head, prays over the water in a low voice.

L

ord our God, who sanctified the streams of the Jordan through your saving manifestation, now send down the grace of your all-holy Spirit on this altar before you, and bless us and this water for the sanctifying and perfecting of your holy altar. ****

Aloud.

For blessed are you to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

Then the Bishop pours water three times on the slab of the Holy Table, saying:

In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

And by means of the water that has been poured out, with the pieces of soap that have been put there, he wipes the table. Then he dries it with the new sponge, but the column, because he cannot wipe it with his hands, he washes and dries it with the sponge. While this is being done, there is said

Psalm 83.

How beloved are your dwellings, O Lord of powers; my soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God. For the sparrow has found itself a house, and the dove a nest for herself, where she will place her nestlings; your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God. Blessed are those who dwell in your house, they will praise you for ages of ages. Blessed the man whose help is from you; he has placed ascents in his heart, to the valley of weeping, to the place he has set. For the lawgiver will give blessings; they will go from strength to strength, the God of gods will appear in Sion. Lord God of powers hear my prayer, give ear, O God of Jacob. O God our shield see; and look on the face of your Christ. For one day in your courts is far better than thousands. I have chosen to be cast aside in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners. For the Lord God loves mercy and truth, he will give grace and glory. The Lord will not deprive of good things those who walk in innocence. Lord God of hosts, blessed is the one who hopes in you.

****

They all chant this until the Bishop has completely wiped and washed the Holy Table. He then gives glory to God, saying:

Glory to our God to the ages.

****

The Clerics and the Choirs:

Amen.

-

THE ANOINTING OF THE HOLY TABLE
AND CONSECRATION OF ANTIMENSIA
-------------------------------

**With the priests standing near the Bishop and when the antimensia have been placed on the four corners of the Table, the Bishop takes a jar full of vine-water or rose-water or white wine and pouring from it three times, he washes the holy Table and wipes it with the antimensia, as he chants the following:**

Tone 7.

You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed; you will wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been humbled will rejoice.

****

This is said three times, then the rest of the Psalm likewise to the end.

Turn away your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your salvation, and establish me with a sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from bloodshed, and my tongue will rejoice at your righteousness. Lord, you will open my lips: and my mouth will declare your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it; you will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer calves upon your altar.

****

Then the Bishop glorifies God, saying aloud:

Blessed is our God, always now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

Reader.

Amen.

****

Then he takes a vessel filled with pure Myron, or mixed with a little olive oil, and when the Deacon has exclaimed:

Let us attend

****

the Bishop, as he pours it onto the holy Table, chants three times, as at a Baptism:

Alleluia!

****

and he makes three Crosses with it, one in the middle and two on either side. And having handed back the vessel, with his hand he wipes the whole of the holy Table with the three Crosses. He also makes Crosses with it on the column. While this is being done the following is chanted.

Psalm 132

See how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together. Like sweet ointment on the head which runs down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, which runs down to the hem of his garment; like the dew from Hermon, which runs down upon the mountains of Sion; for there the Lord has commanded the blessing: life for ever more.

****

After this the Bishop again exclaims:

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

and

Glory to you, holy Trinity, our God, to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

When the Table has been wiped with the Antimensia, these are laid aside again by the Priests. Then at the four corners of the Table the four cloths with the icons, or the names, of the four Evangelists are glued with wax-mastic, like this:

-

THE VESTING OF THE HOLY TABLE
AND CONSECRATION OF THE CHURCH

****

The Bishop takes what is called the ‘katasarkion’, which is spread out on the Table and the strings are tied to the column in the form of a Cross beneath the Table. While this is being done the following Psalm is chanted.

Psalm 131

Lord remember David and all his meekness, how he swore to the Lord, made a vow to the God of Jacob, ‘I shall not enter the shelter of my house, climb into my bed, give sleep to my eyes, slumber to my eyelids and rest to my temples, until I find a place for the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.’ See, we heard of it in Ephratha, we found it in the fields of the wood. We shall enter his tabernacles, we shall worship towards the place where his feet have stood. Arise, Lord, into your rest, you and the ark of your sanctification. Your priests will clothe themselves with justice, and your holy ones will rejoice. For David your servant’s sake, do not turn away the face of your Christ. The Lord has sworn truth to David and he will not annul it, ‘From the fruit of your womb I shall place on your throne. If your sons keep my covenant and these testimonies of mine which I shall teach them, their sons too will sit on your throne for ever. For the Lord has elected Sion, has chosen her as a dwelling for himself. ‘This is my resting-place to age on age. Here I shall dwell, for I have chosen her. Her door I shall bless abundantly, her poor I shall fill with bread. Her priests I shall clothe with salvation, and her holy ones will rejoice with great joy. There I shall make the horn of David flourish; I have prepared a lamp for my Christ. I shall clothe his enemies in shame, my sanctification will flower upon him’.

****

When this is finished, the Bishop exclaims;

Glory to God to the ages. Amen.

****

After this he washes his hands in a new bucket or in the sacrarium, so that not one single drop falls outside, and dries them with a new towel with great care and devotion. He then takes the outer cover, or altar-cloth of the holy Table. While this is being put on, the following Psalm is sung.

Psalm 92

The Lord is King, he has clothed himself with glory. The Lord has clothed and girded himself with power. For he has established the world, which will not be shaken. Your throne is prepared from of old; from eternity you are. The rivers lifted up, Lord, the rivers lifted up their voices. The rivers will lift their poundings from the voices of many waters. wondrous are the breakers of the sea; wondrous the Lord on high. Your testimonies have been made very sure. Holiness befits your house, Lord, to length of days.

****

Once again the Bishop exclaims:

Glory to you, holy Trinity, our God, to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

After this the Bishop unfolds the Antimensia on the Table, placing them one on top of another. Then he unfolds on them the antimension of the Church and places the sacred Gospel on top of it. The Gospel and Altar are venerated with a kiss.

Then he censes the holy Table, the Sanctuary and the whole Church. While the Bishop is censing, the following Psalm is said.

Psalm 25

Judge me, Lord, for I have walked in my innocence; and since I hope in the Lord I will not grow weak. Test me, O Lord, and try me; refine my inner parts and my heart with fire. For your mercy is before my eyes; and I have been well pleased by your truth. I have not sat with a gathering of folly, nor will I go in with the transgressors. I have hated the assembly of evil doers, nor will I sit with the ungodly. I will wash my hands among the innocent, and I will go around your altar, Lord, to hear the voice of your praise and tell of all your wonderful works. Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house, and the place of the dwelling of your glory. Do not destroy my soul with the ungodly, nor my life with men of blood, in whose hands are iniquities; their right hand is filled with bribes. But I have walked in my innocence; rescue me, Lord, and have mercy on me. My foot has stood in uprightness; in the churches I will bless you, O Lord.

****

After censing, the Bishop, carrying a reed to the tip of which has been bound a sponge dipped in holy Chrism, draws the monogram of Christ

****

in the apse of the Sanctuary, on the four columns and on the lintel of the door of the Church on the inside.

**Then he glorifies God, exclaiming:**

Glory to the holy, all-powerful and life-giving Trinity, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen.

CONCLUDING PRAYERS
AND LIGHTING OF THE LAMPS

****

Then the little Litany by the Deacon.

Deacon:

Again and again in peace, let us pray to the Lord. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

Deacon:

Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by your grace. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

Deacon:

Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most blessed and glorious Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, with all the Saints, let us entrust ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God. ****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

Ekphonesis by the Bishop.

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

Deacon:

Let us pray to the Lord. ****

People:

Lord, have mercy. ****

The Bishop says the Prayer aloud.

L

ord our God, Maker of heaven and earth, with ineffable wisdom you founded your holy Church and established on earth the order of Priesthood as an antitype of the angelic Ministry in heaven. Accept us now also, bountiful Master, as we pray, not because we are worthy to ask for such great things, but that your surpassing loving-kindness may be revealed. For you have never ceased to bestow your bounties in countless ways upon the human race, but made the summit of your gifts the Coming of your Only-begotten Son. He appeared on earth and made the light of salvation shine for those in darkness, he offered himself as a sacrifice for us, and became the whole world’s expiation, making us sharers in his own resurrection. And, when he had been taken up into heaven, he clothed his Disciples and Apostles, as he had promised, with power from on high, which is the Holy Spirit, worshipful and all-powerful, who proceeds from you, God and Father. Made powerful through the Holy Spirit in deed and word, they handed on the baptism of filial adoption, raised up Churches, founded Altars, laid down the rules and laws of Priesthood. Holding fast to their tradition, we sinners fall before you, the eternal God, and we implore you, O Compassionate: Fill this House, which has been built to sing your praise, with your glory, and declare this Altar here to be a Holy of Holies, so that we, as we stand before it, as before the dread throne of your kingdom, may worship you without condemnation, offering up supplications for ourselves and for all your people and offering to your loving-kindness the sacrifice with out shedding of blood, for pardon of sins voluntary and involuntary, guidance in life, establishment of a good way of living, fulfilment of all justice. ****

Ekphonesis.

For blessed is your all-holy Name, of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

Bishop:

Peace to all. ****

People:

And to your spirit. ****

Deacon:

Let us bow our heads to the Lord. ****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

And the Bishop says the Prayer.

W

e thank you, Lord our God, that the grace which you poured out on your holy Apostles and our venerable Fathers, you have vouchsafed to extend even to us sinners and your unprofitable servants. Therefore we beg you, most merciful Master: Fill this Altar with glory, sanctification and grace, so that the sacrifices without shedding of blood that are offered to you in it may be changed into the immaculate Body and precious Blood of your Only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ, for the salvation of all your people and of our unworthiness. ****

Ekphonesis.

For you are our God, and to you we give glory, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Then the Deacon exclaims.

Let us go forth in peace.

****

And the Apostle is read.

Prokeimenon. Tone 4. \[Psalm 92\]

Holiness befits your house, Lord, to length of days.

****

Verse:

The Lord is King, he has clothed himself with glory.

The Reading is from the Epistle of Paul to the Hebrews.

****

\[3,1-4\]

H

oly brethren, who share in a heavenly call, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession. He was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in God’s house. Yet Jesus has been counted worthy of as much more glory than Moses as the builder of a house has more honour than the house. For every house is built by some one, but the builder of all things is God. ****

Gospel.

The Reading is from the holy Gospel according to John.

****

\[10,22-30\]

A

t that time, it was the feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem; it was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon. So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, ‘How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.’ Jesus answered them, ‘I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness to me; but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.’ ****

People:

Glory to you, Lord! Glory to you! ****

A new lamp, a wick and olive oil are brought to the Bishop. With his own hands he fills the lamp with oil, lights the wick, while singing three times the opening verse of the Doxology in Tone 1.

Glory to you who have shown us the light.

****

As he removes the white robe, the towels and the belt, the Christians are permitted to light lamps and candles. While this is happening there is chanted,

Glory.

**The Idiomel of the Saint.**

Both now.

**Of the Dedication. Tone 6. By Monk John.**

As we celebrate the memory of the Dedication, loving and all-powerful Lord, we glorify you, the giver of sanctification, asking that the senses of our souls may be sanctified at the intercession of the glorious Champions.

****

Then:

Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. **(three times)**

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your name’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen

Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed, your kingdom come; your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors, and do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

****

Bishop:

For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. ****

The troparion of the saint of the Church and of the Dedication.

Apolytikion of the Dedication. Tone 4.

As the beauty of the firmament above, O Lord, you have displayed the loveliness of the holy Dwelling of your glory below. Strengthen it to age on age and accept, through the Mother of God, our supplications which are offered in it without ceasing to you, the Life and Resurrection of all.

****

Then the Litany by the Deacon.

Have mercy on us, O God, according to your great mercy, we pray you, hear and have mercy.

****

People:

Lord, have mercy. **(Three times)**

Again we pray for mercy, life, peace, health, salvation, visitation, pardon and forgiveness of sins for the servants of God, the Founders of this holy House and that may be pardoned every offence both voluntary and involuntary.

****

People:

Lord, have mercy. **(Three times)**

Bishop:

For you, O God, are merciful and love mankind, and to you we give glory, to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

People:

Amen. ****

And the Dismissal by the Bishop from the Holy Doors.

It is customary that at the first Liturgy in the new Church the opening blessing,

Blessed is the Kingdom**…, should be chanted by the Bishop.**
