CATECHESIS 49
=============

On self-mastery and our present confession.\
On Friday of Meat Week
--------------------------------------------

[[[\[1\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character: footnote; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-footnote-id: ftn1"}](#_ftn1){#_ftnref1}]{style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"}

[Brethren and fathers, most people call the present days Â‘feastsÂ’,
because of they get drunk and debauched during them, not understanding
that these days demand abstinence from meat, not indulgence in
drunkenness and intoxication. That is proper to a pagan feast; it is the
business of Christians to exercise self-control Â‘[and not to satisfy
the desires of the
fleshÂ’]{style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"},[[\[2\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn2){#_ftnref2} as the
Apostle teaches. Nevertheless evil has progressed into law and leads the
world as it wishes. But let us, brethren, flee intemperance even in
partaking of things that are permitted, for we know that intemperance is
the mother of sin. For our forefather Adam, as long as he abstained from
the forbidden food in Paradise, rejoiced and was made glad by divine
visions and filled with divine revelations; but when he acted
intemperately and partook of the tree of disobedience, he was at once
exiled from the delight of Paradise and intemperance for him became the
begetter of death. So too the inhabitants of Sodom behaved wantonly
Â‘[with food in
abundanceÂ’,]{style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"}[[\[3\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn3){#_ftnref3} and drew
down upon themselves the anger of God and were overwhelmed with fire and
brimstone. So too Esau the hated, entrapped by gluttonous eyes,
exchanged his birth right for a meal.[[\[4\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn4){#_ftnref4} Â‘[But the
people of God sat down to eat and drink, and arose to
playÂ’]{style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"}.[[\[5\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn5){#_ftnref5} These are
the sort of things that are going on during these days; for revels and
inebriation, shouting and demonic leapings require not only the day but
most of the night as well. So intemperance is an evil, and through it
death entered the world. But we should give thanks to God, brethren
loved by the Lord, because he has rescued us from such empty behaviour
and transferred us to this blessed life, in which there is not
intemperance, but moderation; not drunkenness, but vigilance; not
disturbance, but peace; not hubbub, but tranquillity; not abuse, but
thanksgiving; not wantonness, but purity, holiness and temperance. From
this it was that our inspired fathers sprang
up,[[\[6\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn6){#_ftnref6} who with God
trampled down the passions, expelled demons, rivalled angels, performed
signs from God, attained heavenly glory, were a cause of wonder in the
world. One of them was the blessed Antony, whose life we have been
reading; and we have learnt how God magnified him in this world under
heaven, so that the kings of the earth thought it important to write to
him and to hear from him a written
voice.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[And so we too, humble wretches, follow their way of life; and that we
imitate it our monastic profession bears witness, our denial of the
world, estrangement from fatherland, race, friends and intimates, our
subjection, our obedience, this present confession, for which we have
also been persecuted. Accordingly, let us rejoice and congratulate one
another that we have been given these gifts of grace by God, and that we
are leading a spiritual life, in which it is always open to us to keep
festival every day, should we so wish, and to rejoice with
unlimited[[\[7\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn7){#_ftnref7} joy.
Therefore I beg you, let us hold mightily to our ascetic practice and
this confession, for a word has gone out that the
Mighty[[\[8\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn8){#_ftnref8} is keeping
an eye on our affairs and doubtless a royal official will suddenly
arrive.[[\[9\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn9){#_ftnref9} But donÂ’t
be scared at what has been said. Â‘If God is on our side, who is against
us?Â’[[\[10\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference style="mso-special-character:
footnote"}](#_ftn10){#_ftnref10} And if he helped us in the past, how
would he not help in the future? Only let us stand nobly, only let us
attend[[\[11\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn11){#_ftnref11} without
faltering, and he himself will give power to all who lead to the end a
life that is well-pleasing to him to gain the kingdom of heaven in
Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be the glory and the power with the
Father and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
Amen.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;

St Theodore in these two clauses deliberately echoes the deaconÂ’s
invitation at the beginning of the anaphora. Hence my somewhat
unidiomatic translation of *prosechomen*. The present subjunctive of
continuous action here contrasts neatly with the aorist of immediate
action in the
Liturgy.]{style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}
