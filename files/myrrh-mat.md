AT MATINS

****

After the first Psalter reading, Resurrection Kathismata. Tone 2.

By not preventing the gravestone from being sealed and by rising again, you granted to all the rock of the faith. Lord, glory to you!

Glory.

Without emptying the most pure bosom in the highest, you accepted burial and resurrection on behalf of all. Lord, glory to you!

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Wholly beyond understanding, wholly glorious are your mysteries, Mother of God. sealed in purity and kept in virginity, you were known to be without deception a Mother who gave birth to the true God. Implore him that our souls may be saved.

****

After the 2nd Psalter reading, other Kathismata.

The Myrrhbearing women, having risen early and seen the grave empty, said to the Apostles, ‘The mighty one has destroyed corruption and snatched those in Hell from their bonds. Boldly proclaim that Christ God has risen, granting us his great mercy’.

Glory.

Bringing the spices for your burial, the women came secretly at dawn to the grave, fearing the harshness of the Jews, and foreseeing that the soldiers would protect it; but the weaker nature defeated manliness, for their loving intent was well-pleasing to God. Fittingly therefore they cried, ‘Arise, Lord, help us, and deliver us for your name’s sake’.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

You are highly glorified, Virgin Mother of God, and we sing your praise, for through the Cross of your Son Hell has been overthrown, death has died, we who were dead have risen and been granted life. We have received Paradise, our ancient delight. therefore with thanksgiving we glorify Christ our God as mighty and alone full of mercy.

****

After Psalm 118, the Evlogitaria and the Ypakoï. Tone 2.

The women coming to your grave after the Passion to anoint your body, Christ our God, saw Angels in the tomb and were amazed, for they heard from them the message, ‘The Lord has risen, granting the world his great mercy’.

****

The Anavathmi of the tone. 1st Antiphon.

I lift up the eyes of my heart to you in heaven, O Saviour. Save me by your radiance.

Have mercy, O my Christ, on us who fail you hour by hour in many ways, and give us the means to turn back to you in repentance before the end.

Glory. Both now.

To the Holy Spirit belong kingship, sanctification and the guidance of creation; for he is God, consubstantial with the Father and the Word.

****

2nd Antiphon.

If the Lord was not among us, who could be kept safe from the one who is both foe and murderer?

Do not hand your servant over to their teeth, my Saviour. Like a lion they come against me, for they too are my foes.

Glory. Both now.

To the Holy Spirit belong the source of life and honour, for, being God, he gives all creatures power and watches over them together in the Father through the Son.

****

3rd Antiphon.

Those who trust in the Lord are like the holy mountain; they are utterly unshaken by the assaults of Beliar.

Let not those who live for God stretch out their hands in lawlessness; for with his rod Christ forbids his lot.

Glory. Both now.

By the Holy Spirit all wisdom flows forth, from which grace comes to the Apostles, the Martyrs are crowned for their struggles, and the Prophets see.

Then the usual order of the Resurrection Gospel \[Eothinon 4\]

\[**Mark 16:1-8** ****

W

hen the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalen and Mary, the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint Jesus. And very early on the first day of the week they went to the grave, when the sun had risen. And they were saying to one another, ‘Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the grave?’ And when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away — it was very large. And entering the grave, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were utterly amazed. But he said to them, ‘Do not be amazed. You seek Jesus the Nazarene, the crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. See, this is the place where they laid him. But go; tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.’ And they went out and fled from the grave; for trembling and astonishment had seized the. And they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.\] ****

Let us purify our senses, and we shall see Christ shining forth, in the unapproachable light of the resurrection, and we shall clearly hear him saying ‘Rejoice!’, as we sing the triumphal song.

****

Troparia.

You were crucified in the flesh, though impassible by the Father’s nature; you were pierced in the side and became a source of blood and water for the world. You are our God and we glorify you.

I honour your Cross and glorify your burial, O Good One. I praise and worship your Rising, and I cry out, ‘You are our God and we glorify you’.

Though you tasted gall, O sweetness of the Church, yet you poured out incorruption for us from your side. You are our God and we glorify you.

You were numbered among the dead, O Saviour, when you raised the dead. You tasted corruption, for you knew nothing at all of destruction. You are our God and we glorify you.

Let Zion rejoice, and let heaven be glad. Christ has risen and raised the dead who sing in praise, ‘You are our God and we glorify you’.

In grave clothes Joseph wrapped your body, O Christ, and laid you, our salvation, in a new tomb; but as God you raised the dead.

Anticipating the dawn, the women saw Christ and cried to God’s Disciples; ‘Christ has risen indeed. Come, and with us sing his praise’.

Glory.

All-holy Trinity, one Godhead, Unity without beginning: Father and Son and divine Spirit, save the world. You are our God and we glorify you.

Now all things are filled with light, both heaven and earth and those beneath the earth: so let all creation sing Christ’s rising, by which it is established.

Troparia.

When you nailed your palms to the Cross, O Jesu, and gathered in all the nations from error, you invited them to knowledge of you, O Saviour.

The Jewish people cried out to Pilate, ‘Release for me the wicked thief. As for the Sinless One, away with him, away with him, crucify him’.

When you were crucified, O Christ, the light grew dark, the earth was shaken and many dead rose from the tomb through fear of your might.

Standing by the Cross, O Jesu, your Ewe-lamb cried out with lamentation, ‘Where are you going, my Son? Where are you departing, Lamb who is slain for all?’

I worship your Cross, I praise your Burial, I honour your sufferings, O Jesu, the nails in your hands, the lance and the Resurrection.

You arose, O Jesu; the enemy was despoiled, Adam, and Eve with him, was delivered from bonds and corruption by your Resurrection.

When you arose, O Christ, the bars and gates of Hell were smashed, and the bonds of death immediately untied, through fear of your might.

Joseph, who received God, come, stand with us and cry, ‘He has risen, Jesus the redeemer, who raised Adam in his compassion!’

Let the twelve Disciples rejoice with us, with the Myrrhbearing women, with Joseph and Christ’s other Disciples, men and women.

Glory.

With the Father I worship and praise the Son and the right Spirit, the one Nature, separating the Persons and uniting the Essence.

Both now. **Theotokion.**

Blessed are you, holy Lady from the root of Jesse. From you according to the flesh sprang Christ, the rod and the flower, for our sake.

Kathisma. Tone 2.

Seeking things on high.

Lovingly bringing spices to your tomb, O Saviour, the women rejoiced in soul at the radiance of the Angel. They proclaimed you God of all, and cried out to the Disciples: ‘The Life of all has risen from the tomb indeed.’

Glory. Both now. **Same Tone.**

The choir of your disciples rejoices in harmony with the Myrrhbearing women, for they celebrate a common feast with them, to the glory and honour of your Resurrection, and through them we cry to you, ‘O Lord, who love mankind, grant to your people your great mercy’.

Ode 4. Irmos.

Let the Prophet Avvakum, inspired by God, keep the divine watch with us, and show forth the radiant Angel, who with resounding voice declares, ‘Today brings salvation to the world, for Christ has risen as omnipotent’.

********

Troparia.

Christ appeared as a ‘male’ who opened a virgin womb; but as our food he is called ‘lamb’; ‘unblemished’, as our Passover without stain; and ‘perfect’ for he is true God.

As a yearling lamb, for us the blessed crown, Christ was willingly sacrificed for all, a cleansing Passover; and from the tomb the fair sun of justice has shone for us again.

God’s forebear David dancing leaped before the Ark, mere shadow; but seeing the fulfilment of the types, let us, God’s holy people, inspired, rejoice, for Christ is risen as omnipotent.

Of the Myrrhbearers. The Irmos.

Foreseeing your birth from a Virgin, the Prophet cried out and proclaimed, ‘I heard your report, O Christ, and was afraid, for you came from Theman and from a holy shaded mountain.’

****Troparia.****

Through a Cross you took prisoner the belly of Hell, you raised the dead with you and overthrew the tyranny of death. Therefore we, Adam’s descendants, falling down in worship sing the praise of your burial and your Rising, O Christ.

You were well pleased, our Saviour, through the bowels of your mercy, to be nailed to the Cross, and to redeem us from the ancestral curse. Release me from the bonds of my many offences, for you can accomplish whatever you will.

Having nailed my ancient curse on the Cross, O Saviour, and become a source of blessing for me through the blood from your side, release me from the bonds of my many offences, for you can accomplish whatever you will.

When Hell met you in the infernal regions, O Saviour, he was embittered, seeing that the dead, whom he of old had had the strength to swallow, now, unwilling, he was giving back. The depths below are being scoured, laid bare and despoiled of the dead.

Though the stone was sealed, O lawless foes, and the watch set, yet the Lord arose as he foretold, releasing the bonds of my many offences, for he can accomplish whatever he wills.

Having risen from the dead, despoiled Hell, given life to the dead and become for me a source of incorruption by your Rising, release the bonds of my many offences, for you can accomplish whatever you will.

Be ashamed indeed, lawless ones, for Christ has risen and raised the dead with him, crying, ‘Be of good courage. I have conquered the world’. Obey him then, or keep silence, misguided ones, who deny his Resurrection.

Having risen from the tomb, O Good One, you greeted the Myrrhbearers with the cry, ‘Rejoice’, and commanded the Apostles, ‘Proclaim my Rising’; release the bonds of my many offences, for you can accomplish whatever you will.

Let us honour the noble Joseph, zealot for true religion, counsellor and disciple, with the Myrrhbearers and the Apostles, as we cry out with them, and with faith and gladness praise the Saviour’s Resurrection.

Glory.

Who can declare the indivisible glory of the Godhead beyond all being? For a Trinity in nature is praised, without beginning, identical in nature, praised as a Unity in Trinity, with simple substances.

The ancient garment, which the sower of sin wove for me, alas, you stripped off me, my Saviour, when you clothed yourself in me.

My sin sewed fig leaves for me when I, alas, by the counsel of the serpent did not keep your most pure commandment, my Saviour.

Coming upon my soul wounded by my thieving thoughts, Christ, the child of Mary, poured oil on it and healed it.

Standing by the Cross the blameless Mother of God called out as a mother, ‘You have left me behind alone, my Son and my God’.

Having overthrown the serpent, origin of evil, with the weapon of your Cross, you smashed the sting of death, O Jesu.

‘Where death is your sting? Where Hell your victory?’ Let Adam join the cry. You have been smashed by the return to life of him who raised the dead.

The Myrrh-bearing women, coming to the tomb of him who gave life to those below, heard a voice saying, ‘Christ has risen!’

As we celebrate the memory of the devout Myrrhbearers and of all your Disciples, in your shining Rising, we sing your praise, O Christ.

Hell is dead. Take courage, you who are born of earth, for Christ, hung upon the tree, has hurled away the sword against him and Hell lies dead. For, stripped naked, he has been despoiled of those he held.

‘Hell has been despoiled! Take courage you dead! The graves have been opened, arise!’ Christ, who came to ransom all mankind from death and corruption, cries out to you from Hell.

‘Now, Hell, you have orders. Give me back the dead you once had strength to swallow’, the Life-giver and God, who came to ransom all mankind from your insatiable maw, cries out to you.

The Lord has risen, having despoiled the foe and delivered the prisoners. He has brought back all mankind and raised Adam the first-formed, for he is compassionate and loves mankind.

Having wrapped you in a winding sheet, O Christ, the noble Joseph laid you in a grave. having anointed the temple of your body which had been destroyed, he rolled a great stone to the mouth of the sepulchre.

O Myrrh-bearing women, why do you still hurry? Why do you bring spices for the living? Christ has risen as he foretold. Let your tears cease: they have changed to joy.

As they went to your tomb, O Saviour, the Myrrhbearers were troubled among themselves in mind and they said, ‘Who will roll away the stone from the grave for us?’ And looking up they see that the stone has been rolled away. They were amazed by the appearance of the Angel and his raiment; they were seized with fright and thought to flee; but the young man cried out to them, ‘Do not be afraid. The one you seek has risen. Come, see the place where the body of Jesus was laid and going quickly tell his disciples: The Saviour has risen from the grave’.

Wishing, as you love mankind, to save from error all those you had fashioned, you endured being nailed to the Cross, that in your flesh, O Saviour, you might renew the image smothered by the passions; and having overthrown Hell you raised up the dead with yourself.

Lifted up on the cross, O Merciful, you called all to yourself, as you had promised, O Good One; for you were well-pleased in truth to suffer all these things because of our sins; so too you opened the gates of Paradise to the thief, O Saviour.

The temple of your body, which had been destroyed, you raised on the third day, as you had promised, O Good One, that in truth you might make known your glory, which you pour out upon us through the faith, having freed the prisoners whom Hell of old held captive.

O the madness of the Jews! O the frenzy of the lawless! What had you seen which was unbelievable, that you did not believe Christ? That he did not raise the sick with a word? That he did not save the whole world himself? If not the soldiers, then let those risen from the dead convince you.

Let the guards, who became as dead men, now say how he was stolen, whom they did not see, being wholly without sensation. For if they did not see, did not perceive him risen, how then could they ever think he had been stolen? Let them convince you, and also this stone and Christ’s grave clothes.

Why do you guard him like a corpse? Why have you set seals on the stone, O Jews? Fearing theft? See, the tomb was truly sealed. How then did Christ arise unless he was God? Let those who arose and were seen by many persuade you.

O blind Jews, deceivers and transgressors, who do not trust Christ’s Resurrection, as though it was a lie, what do you see that you cannot believe? That Christ has risen, he who raised the dead?

O hostile Jews, even though you do not believe us, ask your own soldiers what they experienced. Who with their hands rolled the stone away from the grave?

Who withered the fig-tree? Who healed the withered hand? Who once fed the multitudes in the desert? If not Christ God, who raised the dead.

Who gave light to the blind, healed lepers, cured the lame and walked on the sea dry-shod as though on land? If not Christ God, who raised the dead.

Who raised from the tomb one four days dead, and the widow’s son? Who gave strength to the paralytic on his bed? If not Christ God, who raised the dead.

The stone itself cries out, the seals, which you placed yourselves when you posted the sentries to guard the grave, shout aloud, ‘Christ has risen indeed, and lives to the ages’.

You were given vinegar and gall to drink for our sake, O Saviour, who give us your Body and your precious Blood as the food and drink of your eternal life.

When your life-giving side was pierced by the lance, O Christ, you poured out your immaculate Blood and precious Water as an ever-living spring for the world.

You, who brought the dead to life, were numbered among the dead. You, who emptied the tombs, were laid in a tomb. You despoiled Hell in raising Adam.

You arose, O Jesu. The foe was bound, Hell despoiled, tombs stripped bare, those below raised, as they worshipped you, O Christ.

Who stole the dead body? And moreover naked? Why are you deceived, O Jews? Christ has risen and the bonds and bars of hell have been unloosed.

Glory to you, Christ Saviour, who poured out life, made light dawn for those in the darkness of ignorance, and shone over all the earth by your Rising.

Let the noble counsellor Joseph be praised with the Myrrhbearers and the godly Disciples, as he too is a herald of Christ’s Rising.

Glory.

You are without beginning, O Father; you are uncreated, O Son; you are equal in rank, O Holy Spirit; the three one in nature and three in persons, one true God.

Both now. **Theotokion.**

Let Jesse rejoice and David dance, for see, the Virgin, the stem of God’s planting, has blossomed with the flower, Christ the ever-living.

Katavasia.

Shine, shine.

Holy is the Lord our God **\[****x3**\].****

**Exapostilarion of Pascha. Tone 2.**

Having fallen asleep in the flesh as one mortal, O King and Lord, you rose again on the third day, raising up Adam from corruption, and abolishing death. Pascha of incorruption; salvation of the world.

****

Another, of the Myrrhbearers. Model Melody.
Same Tone.

Women hear a voice of gladness, ‘Trampling on the tyrant Hell, I have raised the world from corruption. Run, tell my friends the good tidings, for I wish joy to shine on what I fashioned from the source from which came grief’.

At Lauds we insert 8 stichera, 4 of the Resurrection and 4 of Anatolios.

Tone 2.

Let everything that has breath and every creature glorify you, O Lord, for through the Cross you have abolished death, that you might show the peoples your Resurrection from the dead, as you alone love mankind.

Let the Jews say how the soldiers lost the king they were guarding. For why did the stone not guard the Rock of life? Let them hand over the buried one, or worship the Risen One, saying with us: Glory to the multitude of your mercies, our Saviour, glory to you.

Rejoice you peoples and be glad. The Angel sat on the stone of the grave: he brought you the good news, saying: Christ has risen from the dead, the Saviour of the world, and filled the universe with fragrance. Rejoice you peoples and be glad.

An Angel before your conception brought the greeting ‘Hail’ to her that was full of grace. An Angel rolled away the stone of your glorious grave at your Resurrection. The one instead of grief revealed signs of joy; the other instead of death proclaimed to us a Master, giver of life. Therefore we cry to you, ‘Benefactor of all mankind, Lord, glory to you!’

****

Other Stichera of Anatolios.

The women sprinkled sweet spices with their tears upon your grave, and their mouths were filled with joy as they said, ‘The Lord has risen!’

Let nations and peoples praise Christ our God, who willingly endured the Cross for us and spent three days in hell; and let them worship his Resurrection from the dead, through which all the ends of the world have been filled with light.

You were crucified, you were buried, O Christ, as you willed; you despoiled death as God and Master, granting the world eternal life and your great mercy.

In truth, lawless ones, by sealing the tomb you have granted us a greater marvel; the guards have the knowledge; today he came from the grave, and they said: You said that while we slept the Disciples came and stole him. And who steals a corpse, especially one that is naked? But he has risen by his own authority as God, leaving behind his grave-clothes in the tomb. Come, O Jews, see how he did not burst the seals the One who trampled on death and grants the human race life without end and his great mercy.

Glory. **Eothinon 4. Tone 4.**

It was early dawn and the women came to your grave, O Christ, but the body which they longed for was not found; therefore they were much perplexed. Then those in dazzling garments came to them and said, ‘Why do you seek the living with the dead? He has risen as he foretold. Why have you forgotten his words?’ Convinced by this they proclaimed what they had seen. But the good tidings seemed an idle tale, so dull were the disciples still. But Peter ran, and having seen, glorified your wonders to himself.

Both now. **Tone 5.**

It is the day of Resurrection; let us be radiant for the festival, and let us embrace one another. Let us say, O brethren, even to those who hate us: let us forgive all things at the Resurrection, and so let us cry: Christ is risen from the dead; death he trampled down by death, and to those in the tombs he has given life.
