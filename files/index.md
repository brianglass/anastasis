On these pages you will find, in the main, translations of our Orthodox
liturgical and patristic texts. Most of the latter are of texts which
have not previously been translated into English.

Some visitors to these pages have pointed out that when printed out in
black and white only, the distinction between text and rubrics is lost.
This can be overcome if the pages are saved into a word processor and
then edited, rather than being printed directly from the screen. The
original text of nearly all these pages was prepared in Microsoft Word.

As there is now a great deal on these pages, I have decided to draw
attention to recently added material by listing it here and adding the
necessary hyperlinks, and reminders, with hyperlinks, to appropriate
pages from earlier years.

My more recent translations of our liturgical texts contain notes,
including biblical and patristic cross references, as well as
discussions of rare or interesting words and expressions. For this
reason I shall put them up in both HTML and PDF formats. In this way
they can easily be downloaded for liturgical use without footnotes.

On the web site of the parish of [St Anthony and St John the
Baptist](http://www.orthodox-islington.org.uk/index.htm) in Islington
you will find a simple Commentary on the Divine Liturgy.
