## ANNOTATED TRANSLATIONS

Few of our liturgical texts have been critically edited or provided 
with explanatory notes and comments. *The Festal Menaion* and *Lenten
Triodion* by Bishop Kallistos and Mother Mary have some notes, mostly
references to Scripture. I have therefore decided to publish on these
pages translations with more or less detailed notes. This is only a
beginning, but I hope visitors will find them useful. As the notes
contain a fair amount of Greek and occasionally Hebrew they will all be
in PDF format, for which a program like Adobe Reader is necessary. This
is available in a free download by clicking on the icon below:
