Troparion of the Prophecy. Tone 4

Because we are weak and paralysed by sins, heal our infirmities, Physician of our souls, \* who know the mind of men, O Lover of mankind.

Prokeimenon in the 4th Tone. Psalm 41.

Hope in God, for I will give him thanks; the salvation of my countenance and my God.

****

Verse:

As the hart longs for the springs of waters, so my soul longs for you, O God.

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Isaias. \[

**8,13-22, 9,1-7**\]

Sanctify the Lord God, and he shall be your fear; and if you trust in him, he will be for your sanctification, and you will not meet with him as a stumbling stone, nor as a falling on a rock; while the houses of Jacob are in a snare, and those who dwell in Jerusalem in a hollow. Because of this many among them will become powerless and will fall and be smashed, and they will draw near and men will be taken in safety. Then they will be manifest who seal themselves not to learn my law. And he will say: I shall wait for God who has turned away his face from the house of Jacob and I shall trust in him. Behold I and the children whom God has given me, and they shall be signs and wonders in the house of Israel from the Lord Sabaoth, who dwells on the mountain of Sion. And if they say to you: Seek out ventriloquists and those who speak from the earth, and those who speak emptiness, those who speak out of their bellies, shall a nation not seek out its God? Why do they seek they dead concerning the living? For he gave the law for a help, that they should speak not according to this word, concerning which there are no gifts to give concerning it. And harsh famine will come upon you; and it shall be that when you are hungry you shall be grieved and speak ill of the ruler and your ancestral customs, and they will look up to the heaven above, and they will look on the earth below, and behold dire distress and darkness, tribulation and misery and darkness, so that it is impossible to see; and he who in distress will not be distressed only for a moment. \[

**9:1**\] Do this first, do this quickly, country of Zavoulon, land of Nephthalim, way of the sea and the rest of the inhabitants of the sea coast and beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations, the parts of Judea. The people who walked in darkness, see, a great light! You who dwell in the country and shadow of death a light will shine on you \[There is an interesting difference, due to iotacism, between the text here and that in Great Compline, which reads ‘us’ rather than ‘you’. The Book of Hours also has a singular imperative in the previous sentence.\]. The most part of the people which you brought down in your joy, they too will be rejoice before you as those who rejoice at harvest and in the way of those who divide the spoil. Because the yoke which lay on them and the rod that was on their neck has been taken away; for the Lord has scattered the rod of those who demanded, as in the day of Madiam. For they shall pay restitution for every robe that has been collected by trickery and every garment with exchange; and they will be willing even if they had been burnt by fire. Because a child has been for us, a son too has been given to us, whose rule was upon his shoulder, and his name is called Angel of great counsel, wondrous counsellor, mighty God, potentate, prince of peace, father of the age to come; for I shall bring peace upon the princes, peace and health to him. Great is his rule and of his peace there is no limit upon the throne of David and his kingdom to establish it and assist it with judgement and with justice from now and for ever; the zeal of the Lord Sabaoth will do all this.

Prokeimenon in the 4th Tone. Psalm 42.

\[

**6,9-22**\]

Noë was a just man, perfect in his generation; Noë was well-pleasing to God. Noë begot three sons, Sem, Cham and Japhet. Now the earth had become corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with injustice. And the Lord God saw the earth, and it was utterly corrupt, because all flesh had utterly corrupted his way upon earth. And the Lord God said to Noë, ‘The moment for all mankind has come before me, because the earth has been filled with injustice because of them, and behold I am utterly destroying them and the earth. So make an ark for yourself from squared logs. You will make the ark with compartments and you will pitch it outside and inside with pitch. And you will make the ark thus: the length of the ark three hundred cubits and the breadth fifty and its height thirty. You will make the ark by narrowing it and complete it above to one cubit; you will make the door of the ark from its side; you will make it with chambers, of two levels and three levels. While I am bringing the flood, water upon the earth to destroy all flesh, in which there is the spirit of life, under heaven; and whatever there is upon the earth shall die. And I shall establish my testament with you; you are to enter the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. And of all the cattle and all the reptiles and all the wild beasts and all flesh you are to bring into the ark two by two, to feed them with yourself; male and female they are to be. Of all the winged birds according to their kind, and of all the cattle according to their kind, and of all the reptiles which creep upon the earth according to their kind, two by two of all they shall enter to you to be fed with you, male and female, while you shall take for yourself of all the foods which you eat, and you shall gather them to yourself, and they shall be for you and for them to eat’. And Noë did everything whatever the Lord God had commanded him, so he did.

Prokeimenon in the 6th Tone. Psalm 44.

I shall make your name to be remembered in every generation.

Verse*:*

My heart has uttered a good word; I tell my works to the king.

The Reading is from Proverbs.

\[

**8,1-21**\]

My son, you will proclaim wisdom, that prudence may obey you; for she is on high peaks, she stands in the midst of the paths; she takes her seat by the gates of the powerful, she is hymned in the entrances. You men, I exhort you, and I utter my voice to the sons of men; you innocent, understand cunning, you that are untaught take on heart. Hearken to me, for I speak solemn things and shall open correct things from my lips; because my throat will meditate truth, while lying lips are an abomination before me. All the words of my mouth are with justice, crooked or twisted is in them; They are all present to those who understand and right to those who find knowledge. Accept instruction and not silver, and knowledge beyond tried gold; for wisdom is better than valuable stones, all that is precious is not equal to her worth. I wisdom have made counsel my dwelling, and I have called upon knowledge and understanding. The fear of the Lord hates injustice, arrogance and pride and ways of evil people; I have hated the perverted ways of the wicked; mine is counsel, mine is safety, mine is prudence, mine is strength; through me kings will reign and the powerful write justice; through me nobles become noble, and tyrants through me hold sway on earth. I love those who are my friends, while those who seek me will find grace. Wealth and glory are mine and the possession of many things and justice. To gather my fruit is far better than gold and precious stone, my produce is better than choice silver. I walk in ways of justice and I pass my time amid paths of justice, that I may divide property to those who love me and fill their treasuries with good things.

Troparion of the Prophecy. Tone 7.

You are our salvation, Lord, and our protector in the day of trouble; \* have mercy on us according to your great mercy, O Lover of mankind.

Prokeimenon in the 1st Tone. Psalm 45.

The Lord of powers is with us; our helper is the God of Jacob.

Verse:

God is our refuge and our strength, our helper in the troubles that have come heavily upon us.

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Isaias.

\[

**9,9-21, 10,1-4**\]

Thus says the Lord: All the people of Ephraim will know and those who dwell in Samaria with insolence and an exalted heart, saying: Bricks have fallen, but come, let us hew stones and cut down sycamores and cedars and let us build a tower; and God will dash those who rise against mount Sion against them, \[

The plural, read by the Triodion, is the reading of S and A. The Hebrew is completely different\], and their enemies he will scatter, Syria from the rising of the sun and the Greeks \[The ‘Philistines’ of the Hebrew have become ‘Greeks’ in the LXX.\] from the setting of the sun, those who devour Israel with their whole mouth. In all this his rage was not turned away, but his hand is still upraised. In all this his rage was not turned away, but his hand is still upraised. But the people was not turned away until it was struck, and they did not seek the Lord. And the Lord away from Israel head and tail, great and small in that day, elder and those who marvel at persons (this is the start) and prophet teaching things that are unlawful (this is the tail). And those who call this people blest will lead them astray, and they lead them astray that they may gulp them down. Because of this the Lord will not rejoice at their youths and will not have mercy on their orphans and on their widows, because all are lawless and evil, and every mouth speaks things that are not just. And iniquity will burn like fire and like dry grass it will be devoured by fire; and it will burn in the thickets of the wood, and all that is round about the hills will be devoured. Because of the anger of the Lord the whole land has burned, and the people will be as though burnt up by fire; a man will not have mercy on his brother, but he will turn aside to the right because he will be hungry and he will eat from the left, and a man will by no means be filled by eating the flesh of his arm. For Manasses will eat of Ephraim and Ephraim of Manasses, because together they will besiege Juda. In all this his rage was not turned away, but his hand is still upraised. \[**10:1**\] Woe to those who write evil; for in writing they write evil, turning aside judgement from the poor, snatching judgement from the paupers of my people, so that widows are for plunder and orphans for forage. And what will they do in the day of visitation? Four your trouble will come from afar; and to whom will flee to be helped? And where will you abandon your glory so as not to fall into captivity? In all this his rage was not turned away, but his hand is still upraised.

**7,1-5**\]

The Lord God said to Noë, ‘Enter the ark, you and all your house, because I have seen that you are just before me in this generation. Of all the clean beasts bring in to you seven by seven, male and female, while of the unclean beasts two by two, male and female, and of all the unclean flying creatures of heaven two by two, male and female, to maintain seed for all the earth. For yet seven days I am bringing rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights and I shall wipe out everything which I have made to rise up.\[

The word used here, which is also the reading of A, is unusual. It means ‘a protuberance’, ‘a prominence’, and hence that which ‘rises’ or ‘grows’, but this sense is not found in the classical language. Lampe takes it to mean ‘work \[of creation\]’, though the texts cited will all go back ultimately to this verse. The LXX, and this is what St John Chrysostom reads, has *exanastasis*, which presumably means ‘that which rises out of \[the earth\]’.\] from the face of the whole earth.

The Hebrew is not without difficulties and the LXX mss differ widely at this point.\] hear instruction and be made wise and do not be stopped up. Blessed the man who will hearken to me, and a man who will guard my ways, keeping vigil at my doors day by day, keeping watch at the doorposts of my entrances; for my ways out are ways out to life, and favour is prepared from the Lord. Those who sin against me act impiously against their own souls; and those who hate me love death. \[**9:1**\] Wisdom has built herself a house. She has slaughtered her beasts and mixed her wine in the mixing bowl, and prepared her table. She her sent out her servants, to invite with a loud proclamation upon the mixing bowl, ‘Whoever is foolish, let him turn to me’. And to those who lack wisdom she said, ‘Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine that I have mixed for you. Abandon folly, that you may reign for ever; and seek prudence, and set aright your understanding with knowledge’. One who corrects the wicked will gain dishonour for himself. One who rebukes the impious will get blame for himself; for to the impious rebukes are blows. Do not rebuke the wicked, lest they hate you. Rebuke a wise man and he will love you. Give instruction to a wise man and he will be wiser; teach a just man and he will increase learning. The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord, and the counsel of Saints, understanding. While to know the law is the part of a good mind. For by this means you will live for a long time, and years will be added to your life. ****

Will an axe be glorified without someone to cut with it? Or will a saw be exalted without someone to draw it, as if someone lifts up a rod or staff? And nor so, but the Lord Sabaoth will send dishonour against your honour, and burning fire will be kindled against your glory. And the light of Israel will be for fire, and he will sanctify him with burning fire and it devours the fuel like grass, On that day the mountains will be consumed, and the hills and the forests, and &lt;the fire&gt; devours from the soul right through to the flesh; and the one who flees will be like one who flees from a burning flame; and those of them who have been left behind shall be a number, and a child will write them.

It came to pass in the six hundredth year in the life of Noë, in the second month, on the twenty second of the month, on that day all the sources of the abyss were broken open, and the flood-gates of heaven were opened. And there came rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights. On that day Noë, Sem, Cham, Japheth, the sons of Noë and the wife of Noë and the three wives of his sons entered the ark with him; and all the wild beasts according to their kind and all the cattle according to their kind and everything that creeps upon the earth according to its kind, and every winged bird according to its kind, entered to Noë into the ark, two by two, male and female of all flesh in which is a spirit of life. And those that entered male and female went in, according as the Lord God had commanded Noë. And the Lord God shut the ark from outside on him. And the flood came for forty days and forty nights upon the earth, and the waters were multiplied and lifted the ark up, and it was raised high from the earth. And the water prevailed, and was multiplied exceedingly upon the earth, and the ark was being borne upon the water. The water prevailed, prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and covered all the high mountains which were under heaven. Fifteen cubits was the water raised up, and hid all the high mountains. All flesh died which moved upon the earth, of the flying creatures and the cattle and the wild beasts and every reptile which moved upon the earth and every human. And everything which has the breath of life, and everything which was on the dry land, died. And he wiped out everything that rose up from the earth; and Noë alone was left, and those with him in the ark. And the water was raised over the earth for one hundred and fifty days. \[9:1\] And God remembered Noë and all the wild beasts and all the cattle and all the winged creatures and all the reptiles that were with him in the ark, and God brought a wind upon the earth, and the water abated, and the sources of the abyss and the flood-gates of heaven were closed over, and the rain of heaven was withheld. And the water subsided and went from the earth, and the water grew less after one hundred and fifty days.

\[

**10,1-22**\]

A wise son makes his father glad, but a foolish son is a grief to his mother. Treasures will not profit the lawless, but justice will deliver from death. The Lord will not starve a just soul, but he will overturn the life of the ungodly. Poverty humbles a man, but the hands of the courageous enrich. A son who has been instructed is wise, but he will use the fool as a servant. A thoughtful son has been saved from heat, but a lawless is blasted by the wind at harvest. The blessing of the Lord is upon the head of the just, but untimely grief will cover the mouth of the ungodly. The memory of the just is with praises, but the name of the ungodly is extinguished. One wise in heart will accept commandments, but one unguarded in lips will be overthrown in his perversity. One who walks simply walks trustingly, but one who perverts his ways will be known. One who winks with the eyes with trickery, gathers griefs for men; while one who reproves with boldness, makes peace. A source of life is on the lips of the just, but destruction will cover the mouth of the ungodly. Hatred rouses strife, while friendship covers all who do not love strife. One who puts forth wisdom from his lips smites the man lacking in sense. The wise will conceal perception, but the mouth of the hasty draws near to ruin. The property of the rich is a strong city; but poverty is the ruin of the ungodly. The works of the just produce life, the fruits of the ungodly sins. Instruction guards ways of just life, instruction without rebuke goes astray. Just lips conceal enmity, but those who utter insults are very foolish. From much talking you will not escape sin, by restraining your lips you will be thoughtful. Silver tried is the tongue of the just, but the heart of the ungodly will fail. The lips of the just know exalted things, but the foolish die in want. The Lord’s blessing is on the head of the just; it enriches him and grief will not be added to his heart.

Thus says the Lord: On a mountain of the plain raise a standard, lift up the voice to them: do not fear, comfort with the hand; open up, you rulers. I give order and I bring them; giants are coming to fulfil my wrath, rejoicing at the same time and insulting. A voice of many nations on the mountains, like that of many nations, a voice of kings and gathered nations. The Lord Sabaoth has commanded a nation in arms to come from a land far away, from the furthest foundation of heaven, the Lord and his armed men, to destroy the whole inhabited world. Howl, for the day of the Lord is near, and destruction will come from God. Because of this every hand will grow feeble and every human soul will quail. And the elders will be troubled and pangs will grip them like those of a woman in child-birth; and they will mourn one to another and be amazed and change their face like a flame. For see, the day of the Lord is coming without healing, of wrath and anger to make the inhabited world a desert and to destroy sinners from it. For the stars of heaven and Orion and all the host of heaven will not give light, and when the rises there will be darkness and the moon will not give her light. And I shall command evils for the whole inhabited world and for the ungodly their sins; and I shall destroy the arrogance and the arrogance of the lawless I shall humble. And those that are left behind will be more precious than gold tried by fire; and a man will be more precious than the stone of Souphir. For the heaven will be enraged and the earth be shaken from its foundations through the wrath of the anger of the Lord Sabaoth on the day when his wrath attacks.

The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the twenty seventh day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat. While the water grew less until the tenth month. And in the tenth month, on the first of the month, Noë opened the window of the ark, which he had made, and sent forth the raven †to see if the water had ceased*.*† \[

The omission of this clause by Lee Brenton suggests that his basis is the Sixtine edition of 1587. The clause does not occur in the MT of the Hebrew.\] and going out it did not return until the water had dried up from the earth. And he sent the dove after it to see if the water had ceased from the earth. And the dove not finding rest for her feet returned to him into the ark, because water was on all the face of the earth, and stretching out his hand he took her and brought her to himself into the ark. And having waited again seven other days again he sent out the dove from the ark. And the dove returned to him towards evening, and she had a an olive leaf, a twig, in her mouth, and Noë knew that the water had ceased from the earth. And he waited again seven other days and again sent out the dove, and she did not return to him again. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year in the life of Noë, in the first month, on the first of the month, that the water subsided from the earth. And Noë uncovered the roof of the ark, which he had made, and saw that the water had subsided from the face of the earth. In the second month on the twenty second of the month the earth was dry. And the Lord God spoke to Noë saying, ‘Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives and all the wild beasts that are with you, and all flesh from the winged creatures to the cattle, and every reptile moving on the earth, bring out with yourself; and increase and multiply upon the earth’. And Noë and his wife and his sons and his sons’ wives with him; and all the wild beasts and all the cattle and every winged creature and every reptile moving on the earth according to their kind came out of the ark. And Noë built an altar to the Lord; and took of all the clean beasts and of all the clean birds and offered them as a whole burnt offering on the altar. And the Lord God smelt an odour of sweetness.

Verse:

The Reading is from Proverbs.

\[

**10,31-11,1-12**\]

The mouth of the just distils wisdom, but the tongue of the unjust will perish. The lips of just men distil graces, but the mouth of the ungodly is turned away. \[

**11:1**\] Falsified balances are an abomination before the Lord, but a just weight is acceptable to him. Wherever arrogance enters, there too does dishonour; but the mouth of the humble meditates wisdom. The perfection of the upright will guide them, and the overthrow of the rebellious will spoil them. Possessions will profit nothing in a day of wrath, but justice will deliver from death. When a just man dies he has left regret, but the destruction of the ungodly is speedy and brings joy. Justice rightly directs blameless ways, but ungodliness falls in with injustice. The justice of upright men delivers them, but transgressors are caught by their destruction. When a just man has come to his end hope does not perish, but the boast of the ungodly perishes. A just man escapes from a trap, in his stead the ungodly is handed over. In the mouth of the ungodly is a snare for citizens; but the perception of the just is prosperous. By the good things of the just a city prospers, and in the loss of the ungodly there is rejoicing. By the blessing of the upright a city will be exalted, but by the mouth of the ungodly it was overthrown. One lacking in sense sneers at citizens, but a man of prudence brings stillness.
