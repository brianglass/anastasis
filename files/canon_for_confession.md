INTRODUCTORY NOTE

This little known Canon in preparation for Confession is to be found in
the Greek *Great Euchologion.* As the concluding prayer makes clear, the
Confession is in preparation for Holy Communion. The prayer might well
be used as a prayer of absolution when penitents come for Confession
before the Liturgy.

The Gospel, from that according to St Mark, is translated from the
Church[Â‘]{style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua";mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"}s
text. Virtually all modern editions of the Greek and all modern
translations, following the reading of the best manuscripts, omit the
final verse, [Â“But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in
heaven forgive you your
offencesÂ“.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

that you are receiving it, and it will be yours. Whenever you stand
praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your
Father in heaven may also forgive you your offences. But if you do not
forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive you your
