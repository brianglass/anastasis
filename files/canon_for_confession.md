INTRODUCTORY NOTE

This little known Canon in preparation for Confession is to be found in the Greek *Great Euchologion.* As the concluding prayer makes clear, the Confession is in preparation for Holy Communion. The prayer might well be used as a prayer of absolution when penitents come for Confession before the Liturgy.

The Gospel, from that according to St Mark, is translated from the Church<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
