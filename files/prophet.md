AT VESPERS
==========

**At** Lord, I have cried**, we sing Prosomia.**

Tone 4. Called from on high.

You revealed your Prophet, O Immortal, as a living cloud, water truly springing up to eternal life, sending him forth and richly gracing him with the Holy Spirit, consubstantial with you, almighty Father, and with your Son, who shone forth from your being; through whom he foretold the saving Coming of Christ our God, and prophesied salvation to all the nations.

By purity of mind you received the whole brightness of the radiance whose source is God, and you became a speaker, foreteller and godly interpreter of divine words; you appeared as the Spirit’s mouth moved by God, declaring and making clear to all the nations the things revealed to you through him, all-honoured Prophet, the salvation that would be given and the kingdom of Christ; implore him to save and enlighten our souls.

Made resplendent by a worthy vision of God, and honoured by prophetic contemplation and grace, inspired Prophet, you were made worthy of blessedness; using your boldness to him now, who is all good, and your compassion, do not cease to intercede on behalf of those who with faith praise you and honour you as revered and inspired and possessed by God, that our souls may be delivered and saved from dangers.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

As I sail by sea, travel by road, sleep by night, watch over me; give me the grace of a watchful mind, All-blameless, and grant that I may do the Lord’s will; that on the day of sentence I who flee to your protection may find release from all that I have done in life.

****

Or Cross-Theotokion.

When the Ewe-lamb, your Mother, saw you nailed to the Cross, Lord, she was struck with amazement, and cried out: What is this sight, my Son so greatly loved? Is this how the disobedient, lawless people repays your many wonders? But glory, Master, to your ineffable condescension!
