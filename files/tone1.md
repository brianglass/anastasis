MODE 1
======

At the end of each of the eight Modes in the Paraklitiki there is a short set of doggerel lines describing the characteristics of the Mode in question. For the entertainment of readers I include equally doggerel translations of them at the beginning of each Mode.

**FIRST MODE**

The art of music marvels at your sounds,
Gives you the first place. Ah, how well deserved!
As you are called First Mode by music’s art,
First then be eulogised by us in words.
O First, the first of beauties you obtain;
First prize you hold of all in every place.

Matins for Sunday through Wednesday are complete, but I have still to add the second canons for Thursday and Friday. Neither canon for Saturday Matins has been completed, but the custom is that the first canon on Saturday is that of the Saint of the monastery, or church.
