The Paschal Canon
-----------------

The hymnwriters of the Church take their inspiration from the Holy
Scriptures and the Fathers of the Church, but since the service books
are intended for practical use in the services, they are not supplied
with notes or commentary. Some knowledge of these sources is essential
if one is fully to appreciate the theological richness of these texts.

St Nikodemos of the Holy Mountain in his three volumes of commentary of
the Festal Canons, including all those of Holy Week, is an extraordinary
rich source for the study of these hymns. Sadly, they have never been
translated into English and are not widely read in Greek, being written
in elevated eighteenth century language.

The following version of the Paschal Canon by St John of Damascus is an
attempt to begin to supply this lack.
