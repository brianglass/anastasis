# FIFTY FIVE CHAPTERS

**Introduction**

This on one of a number of sets of Beatitudes in the writings of the
Greek Ephrem. They are in the nature of *apothegmata*. They cover many
aspects on monastic life, though their application is much wider. They
seem to have no particular arrangement, though from time to time
thoughts on related topics, or with linked images, appear to be grouped
together. There are numerous allusions to Holy Scripture, which I hope
to add later. The curious expression *the skin of the flesh* in number
48 is an allusion to the regulations for dealing with ‘leprosy’ in
Leviticus 13. St Ephrem uses it to refer to the visible, the physical,
body, which, despite its allure, will rot and exude putrefaction after
death. As in a number of texts in these writings, St Ephrem, towards the
end of the series, is much preoccupied with death and the coming
judgement.

Like the similar set of twenty beatitudes, which I hope to translate
shortly, these fifty five beatitudes are followed by a number of pages
of continuous prose in the form of a sermon on the need for repentance,
which are prepared for by the final sentence, in the first person, of
Beatitude 55. This too I hope to translate before too long.

**FIFTY FIVE BEATITUDES**

>     the earthly things of this vain life and loved God alone, the good
>     and compassionate.

>     field bearing wheat.

>     and planted a spiritual vine, plucked the grapes and filled his
>     presses with fruits of life in the Lord.

>     spiritual gladness from the fruit of the virtues, which he planted
>     by toiling to give back the fruit of life in the Lord.
> 5.  Blessed the one who stands in the assembly and prays like an Angel

>     no entrance to the Evil One to make his soul a prisoner, far from
>     God his Saviour.
> 6.  Blessed the one who with understanding has loved weeping and with
>     compunction rained tears upon the ground, like fair pearls before

>     that are darkened, for they followed the heresy of the faithless
>     and impious.
> 45. Blessed the one who loves truth continually and has not lent his

>     throw the plank out of his own eye.

>     and lament as we watch our brothers in everlasting glory, while we
>     are in torments.
