Canon to the Trinity, of which the acrostic is

A fifth canon to the triple Light ****

Ode 1. Tone 5.

As we hymn the might of the single and three-sunned form, we cry: All-powerful God irradiate our mind and raise it, Master, to your ineffable glory.

Far above, the spiritual orders of the Angels ceaselessly hymn you with thrice-holy songs, Unity triple in number of like form and Trinity of like form, beyond being and all-powerful.

Impart to my soul, O Trinity, Unity source of light, the sweet light-giving nectar of your love and godly, cleansing compunction, most merciful Master of all creation.

****

Theotokion.

From heaven, immaculate Virgin, as upon the fleece, the rain came down noiselessly into your womb, and saved all human nature, parched and dry.

****

Ode 3.

The spiritual beings you conceived and caused them to subsist to hymn your Godhead unceasingly, O God, triple light and maker of all; but accept too the supplication of creatures of clay and earth, and their entreaty, as you are compassionate.

By nature you admit no alteration; grant to us who are changeable and who sing the unsearchable fount of your goodness pardon of offences and salvation as you are compassionate.

We glorify you, Father, Son and Spirit in the unchangeable form of the Godhead, the single and triple-shining Lord, as the Prophets and Apostles were clearly taught by you.

****

Theotokion.

As the Angel of Great Counsel of the Almighty you appeared to Moses in the bush, O Word of God; foreshowing your incarnation from a Virgin through which you have transformed us and made us mount to heaven.

****

Kathisma.

You are merciful, O undivided Trinity; for you have mercy on all as all-powerful; you are all-pitying, compassionate and full of mercy. Therefore we flee to you, sinners weighed down by many sins who cry: Have mercy on your servants and deliver us all from every punishment.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

All-holy Virgin, have mercy on us, who with faith flee to you in your compassion, and ask for your fervent assistance; for as you are good you have power to save us all, as you are Mother of God most high and ever employ your motherly intercessions, O full of God’s grace.

****

Ode 4.

Mystic initiate of the triple light of the one Lordship, Daniel saw Christ as judge going towards the Father and the Spirit who revealed the vision.(

**Twice**)

Make worthy of the Angels’ glory those who with mouths of clay sing the praise of the God above being, triple in persons, single in nature.

****

Theotokion.

Wooded and shaded mountain, which Avvakoum saw of old, from which the Holy One came forth, you revealed the offspring, hard to contemplate, O Virgin, of your conceiving.

****

Ode 5.

O threefold light, my God, who through goodness created humankind and made it according to your image, come, dwell in me, as you are good and love humankind.

O three-sunned Unity, guide me to the paths of your divine salvation and fill me with your radiance, as by nature God of infinite power.

The one nature’s undivided light, separated in persons, triple brightness, knowing no evening, irradiate my heart with your beams.

****

Theotokion.

As the Interpreter of old saw you, O pure and all-immaculate, as a gate looking towards the unsetting light, he at once knew you to be the dwelling place of God.

****

Ode 6.

Triple radiance, divine Sovereignty, you are one as like in form and equal in operation according to both being and to will. (

**Twice**)

The Prophet, singing to the Father: By your light, the Spirit, we shall see light, the Son, fully revealed one God, the triple sun.

****

Theotokion.

Redemption from faults and dangers send down upon those who hymn you, Master, God, single and triple light, at the intercessions God’s Mother.

****

Kathisma.

Let us now glorify the three-sunned radiance and let us worship the simple Trinity, for it has enlightened us and delivered from corruption the whole race of mortals, delivered the whole world from the error of idols and granted us the Kingdom.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. Same melody.**

Wholly at a loss, I have fled to you, the hope of all, and the refuge of sinners and the humble, as I cry: I have sinned. But I, insensitive wretch, continue in my badness; have mercy on me before the end, turn me back and deliver me, the unworthy, from every punishment.

****

Ode 7.

In possessing an abyss and an infinite sea of mercy, pitying Lord, have mercy on those who hymn you, one God all things and yet threefold light.

Praising you the incomprehensible, single yet triple light, God and Lord, we cry to you: Grant to your servants pardon of offences.

****

Theotokion.

Like the Father without beginning is the branch you have put forth, O Virgin, flower of the Godhead, co-eternal shoot, who gives life to all humankind.

****

Ode 8.

Even that of old you might clearly reveal the triple hypostasis of the one Lordship, you appeared, my God, in human form to Abraham as he praised your single might. (

Let me be worthy to descry your divinely working rays, O unapproachable light, compassionate Father, Word and Spirit, that I may ever be pleasing to you, Lord of all.

****

Theotokion.

You made one of the three-sunned glory blaze forth for us, All-praised Virgin, Christ the Lord, who initiates all to sing the praise of the one divine Sovereignty to all the ages.

****

Ode 9.

Mortal speech has no strength to hymn you worthily, O Unity without beginning; unless, daring as far as is attainable from faith, O Trinity of equal throne, we offer divine glory and praise to your might. (

**Twice**)

With mouths unsullied, Cherubim and Seraphim glorify you, the one God of threefold light, with equal-matching glory; with them, Lord, also accept us sinners, who magnify your might.

****

Theotokion.

As pure, blameless and virgin you bore a Son, who delivers us from temptations, God without change; but now implore him too to give us forgiveness of faults.
