FOR WEEKDAYS WITH NO PRESANCTIFIED

****

After the Prayer of St Ephrem at the end of the Typika, the Lamplighter goes out and sounds the big simandron. We pray quietly and the Superior reads the Opening Psalm as follows:

Come, let us worship and fall down before the King, our God.
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ the King, our God.
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King and our God.

****

Psalm 103

Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you have been greatly magnified. You have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his upper chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind, making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle; waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at the voice of your thunder. The mountains rise and the plains descend to the place which you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await them to quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling: and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human heart. The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There the sparrows will build their nests; the heron’s dwelling is at their head. The high mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night, in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they will lie down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth has been filled with your creation. Also this great, wide sea; there there are creeping things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go to and fro; this dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to you to give them their food in due season. When you give it them, they will gather it. When you open your hand all things will be filled with goodness. But when you turn away your face they will be troubled. You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust. You will send forth your spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of the earth. May the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his works. He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. May my words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no more. Bless the Lord, my soul!

****

And again

The sun knew the hour of its setting: you made darkness, and it was night. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all!

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.
Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (

When the Opening Psalm is completed the Priest, outside the Holy Doors, says the:

Litany of Peace

Priest:

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

People:

Amen. ****

After the Litany, the appointed Kathisma of the Psalter is read by one Reader.

KATHISMA EIGHTEEN

**Psalm 119
A Song of Ascents.**

When I was afflicted I called to the Lord, and he heard me. O Lord, deliver my soul from unjust lips and from a deceitful tongue. What should be given you, what added to you against a treacherous tongue? The sharpened arrows of the powerful, with the coals of desolation. Woe is me! For my sojourning has been prolonged, I have camped among the encampments of Kedar; my soul has long been a sojourner. With those who hate peace I was peaceable; when I spoke with them, they made war on me for nothing.

****

Psalm 120
A Song of Ascents.

I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains. From where will my help come? My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. Do not let your foot waver; may he who guards you not slumber. See, he who guards Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord will guard you, the Lord is protection for you on your right hand. By day the sun will not scorch you, nor the moon by night. The Lord will guard you from every evil, the Lord will guard your soul. The Lord will guard your coming in, and your going out, from now and for ever more.

****

Psalm 121
A Song of Ascents.

I rejoiced at those who said to me: we shall go to the house of the Lord. Our feet were standing in your courts, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem built as a city, shared by all together. For there the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord. For there thrones were set for judgement, thrones over the house of David. Ask then for the things which are for Jerusalem’s peace, and prosperity for those who love you. May there be peace then in your power and prosperity in your citadels. For the sake of my brethren and neighbours, I have spoken peace concerning you. For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I have sought good things for you.

****

Psalm 122
A Song of Ascents.

I have lifted my eyes to you who dwell in heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look to their lords’ hands; as the eyes of a maid to her mistress’s hands, so do our eyes to the Lord our God, until he take pity on us. Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us, for we have had our fill of contempt, our soul has been filled to overflowing. Let reproach be for the prosperous, and contempt for the proud.

****

Psalm 123
A Song of Ascents.

If the Lord had not been among us, let Israel now say: if the Lord had not been among us when men rose up against us, they would have swallowed us down alive. When their fury raged against us; the water would have drowned us, our soul would have passed through the torrent; our soul would have passed through irresistible water. Blessed is the Lord, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul was delivered like a sparrow from the snare of the hunters; the snare was shattered, and we were delivered. Our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (

**x3**)
Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Psalm 124
A Song of Ascents.

Those who trust in the Lord, are as Mount Sion; he who dwells in Jerusalem will never be shaken. Mountains encircle her, and the Lord encircles his people from now and for ever. For the Lord will not leave the rod of sinners upon the heritage of the just, lest the just stretch out their hands in iniquities. Do good, Lord, to the good and to the honest in heart. But the Lord will drive away with those who work iniquity those who turn aside to extortions; peace upon Israel.

****

Psalm 125
A Song of Ascents.

When the Lord turned back the captivity of Sion, we became as those who are comforted. Then was our mouth filled with joy and our tongue with rejoicing. Then they will say among the nations: the Lord has done great things with them. The Lord has done great things with us, we have become joyful. Turn back our captivity, O Lord, like streams in the south. Those who sow with tears, will reap with joy. They went and as they went they wept, while they sowed their seed. But when they come they will come with joy, as they gather up their sheaves.

****

Psalm 126
A Song of Ascents.

Unless the Lord build the house, the builders have toiled for nothing. Unless the Lord guard the city, the watchman has kept vigil for nothing. Your getting up at dawn is for nothing, your rising after sitting, you who eat the bread of sorrow, when he gives sleep to his beloved; see, sons are the Lord’s inheritance , the reward of the fruit of the womb. As arrows in the hand of a powerful man, so are the sons of the rejected. Blessed the man who satisfies his desire with them; they will not be shamed when they speak with their enemies in the gates.

****

Psalm 127
A Song of Ascents.

Blessed are all who fear the Lord, who walk in his ways. You will eat the toils of your fruits; you are blest, and it will be well with you. Your wife like a luxuriant vine against the sides of your house. Your sons like new olive shoots around your table. See, that is how one who fears the Lord will be blessed. The Lord bless you from Sion, and may you see the good things of Jerusalem all the days of your life. And may you see your children’s children. Peace upon Israel.

****

Psalm 128
A Song of Ascents.

Many times they have made war on me since my youth, let Israel now say. Many times they have made war on me since my youth, and yet they have not prevailed over me. The sinners have wrought upon my back, they have prolonged their iniquity. The Lord is just, he has broken the sinners’ necks. Let all those who hate Sion be shamed and turned back. Let them become like grass on the housetops, which withers before it is uprooted: The reaper has not filled his hand with it, nor the one who gathers the sheaves his bosom. Nor have the passers-by said: The Lord’s blessing be on you. We have blessed you in the name of the Lord.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (

**x3**)
Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Psalm 129
A Song of Ascents.

Out of the depths I have cried to you, O Lord; Lord, hear my voice; let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication. If you note our iniquities, Lord Lord, who will survive? Because forgiveness is with you. For your name’s sake I have waited for you, O Lord; my soul has waited for your word, my soul has hoped in the Lord. From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch, let Israel hope in the Lord. Because with the Lord there is mercy and with him abundant redemption; and he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

****

Psalm 130
A Song of Ascents.

Lord, my heart has not been exalted, nor have my eyes become lofty, I have neither walked among great affairs, nor among marvels beyond me. If I had not been humble-minded but exalted my soul, like a weaned child towards its mother, so You will requite my soul. Let Israel hope in the Lord, from now and for ever.

****

Psalm 131
A Song of Ascents.

Lord remember David and all his meekness, how he swore to the Lord, made a vow to the God of Jacob, I shall not enter the shelter of my house, climb into my bed, give sleep to my eyes, slumber to my eyelids and rest to my temples, until I find a place for the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. See, we heard of it in Ephrata, we found it in the woodland fields. We shall enter his tabernacles, we shall worship towards the place where his feet have stood. Arise, Lord, into your rest, you and the ark of your sanctification. Your priests clothe themselves with justice, and your holy ones will rejoice. For David, your servant’s sake, do not turn away the face of your Christ. The Lord has sworn truth to David and he will not annul it, ‘From the fruit of your womb I shall place on your throne. If your sons keep my covenant and these testimonies of mine which I shall teach them, their sons too will sit on your throne for ever. For the Lord has elected Sion, has chosen her as a dwelling for himself. ‘This is my resting-place for age on age; here I shall dwell, for I have chosen her. Her door I shall bless abundantly, her poor I shall fill with bread. Her priests I shall clothe with salvation, and her holy ones will rejoice with great joy. There I shall make the horn of David flourish; I have prepared a lamp for my Christ. I shall clothe his enemies in shame, my sanctification will flower upon him’.

****

Psalm 132
A Song of Ascents.

See how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together. Like sweet ointment on the head which runs down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, which runs down to the hem of his garment; like the dew from Hermon, which runs down upon the mountains of Sion; for there the Lord has commanded the blessing: life for ever more.

****

Psalm 133
A Song of Ascents.

Come, now bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. Lift up your hands by night to the Holy Place, and bless the Lord. May the Lord bless you from Sion, he who made heaven and earth.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.
Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

\[

**B**\] Let my prayer be directed like incense before you; the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice. Hear me, O Lord.

Thanksgiving at the Lighting of the Lamps

**
An ancient poem, or, as some say, by the Martyr Athenogenes.**

O joyful light of the holy glory of the immortal, heavenly, holy, blessed Father, O Jesus Christ. Now that we have come to the setting of the sun and see the evening light, we sing the praise of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It is right at all times to hymn you with holy voices, Son of God, giver of life. Therefore the world glorifies you.

****

Priest (facing the People):

Prokeimenon of the evening. \[**from the Triodion, followed by the Readings**\] ****

After the reading from Proverbs say this prayer.

Grant, Lord, to keep us this evening without sin. Blessed are you, Lord, the God of our fathers, and praised and glorified is your name to the ages. Amen.

Let your mercy, Lord be upon us, as we have hoped in you.

Blessed are you, Lord: teach me your statutes.

Blessed are you, Master: make me understand your statutes.

Blessed are you, Holy One: enlighten me with your statutes.

Lord, your mercy is for ever; do not scorn the work of your hands. To you praise is due, to you song is due, to you glory is due, to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Lord our God, who bowed the heavens and came down for the salvation of the human race, look upon your servants and upon your inheritance, for to you, the fearful Judge who love mankind, your servants have bowed their heads and inclined their necks, not waiting for any human help, but awaiting your mercy and looking for your salvation. Guard them at every moment, during both the present evening and the approaching night, from every foe, from every hostile operation of the devil and from vain thoughts and evil desires.

Psalm 33

I will bless the Lord continually, his praise will always be in my mouth. My soul will be praised in the Lord; let the meek hear it and rejoice. Magnify the Lord with me, let us exalt his name together. I sought the Lord and he heard me, and delivered me from all my afflictions. Come to him and be enlightened, and your faces will not be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him from all his afflictions. The angel of the Lord will encamp round those who fear him, and deliver them. Taste and see that the Lord is good. Blessed the one who puts their hope in him! Fear the Lord, all you his saints, for those who fear him never want. The rich have become poor and gone hungry, but those who seek the Lord will not be deprived of any good. Come, children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Who is there who wants life, loves to see good days? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are on the just, and his ears towards their supplication. The Lord’s face is set against those who do evil, to destroy their memory from the earth. The just cried and the Lord heard them, and delivered them from all their afflictions. The Lord is close to those who are broken-hearted, and will save the humble in spirit. The afflictions of the just are many, but the Lord will deliver them from them all. The Lord guards all their bones, not one of them will be broken. The death of sinners is evil, and those who hate the just will go astray. The Lord will rescue the souls of his servants, and no one of those who hope in him will go astray.

Reader:

Priest (from inside the Sanctuary):

Blessed is He Who Is, Christ our true God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. May the Lord God strengthen the holy and pure faith of devout and orthodox Christians, with his holy Church and this sacred Monastery, to ages of ages. ****

Priest:

Most holy Mother of God, save us. ****

Reader**:**

Greater in honour than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word; truly the Mother of God, we magnify you. ****

The Priest facing the People, gives the Dismissal as follows:

Glory to you, Christ God, our hope, glory to you.

****

Reader:

Glory. Both now. Lord, have mercy **(x3)***.* Give the blessing. ****

And the Priest continues:

May Christ our true God, at the prayers of his most pure and holy Mother; of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles; of Saint

**N.** \[**the patron of the church**\], of Saint **N.**, whose memory we celebrate; of the holy and righteous forebears of God, Joachim and Anne and of all the Saints, have mercy on us and save us, for he is good and loves mankind. ****

In the monasteries of the Holy Mountain it is customary for the following dialogue to be added at the end of the Dismissal.

\[

**A**\] Accept, Lord, the supplication of us sinners, and have mercy on us.

\[

**B**\] May your mercy, Lord, be upon us, as we have put our in hope in you.

\[

**A**\] Eternal your memory, blessed and ever remembered Founders.

\[

**B**\] Eternal your memory. ****

Turning to the East, he says,

Through the prayers of our holy Fathers, Lord Jesus Christ our God, have mercy on us.

****

People:

Amen.
