**ON SUNDAY MORNING**

AT THE MIDNIGHT OFFICE
----------------------

****

We sing the Canon to the holy Trinity, source of life, of which the acrostic is:

I sing the one Nature, triple-sunned.

****

A composition by Metrophanes.
Ode 1. Tone 1.
The Irmos. Your triumphant right hand.

One source three-personned the Seraphim glorify, without beginning, eternal, maker of all things, incomprehensible, whom every tongue faithfully honours in songs.

That you might show humanity your single Godhead with triple splendour, of old you fashioned it and formed it according to your image, giving it mind and reason and spirit, for you love mankind.

Showing from on high the single might in three divine persons, Father, you spoke to your co-equal Son and to the Spirit: Come let us go down and confound their tongues.

****

Theotokion.

As Mind, the Father who is unbegotten, was prophesied in image by the wise, as Word the consubstantial Son, and the Holy Spirit who in the Virgin caused the incarnation of the Word.

****

Ode 3. You alone know.

Of old as you appeared clearly to Abraham, triple in person and single by the nature of the Godhead, you revealed in figure the pure doctrine of the Godhead, and faithfully we sing your praise, God the sole ruler of triple sun.

Born from you, Father, as befitted God, without change, the Son shone forth, light from light, in no way different, and the divine Spirit as light proceeded. And we faithfully worship and glorify the three-personned radiance of one Godhead.

The Trinity, Unity beyond nature, ineffably beyond understanding, is glorified by the spiritual Beings, that shout out their never silent praise in thrice holy songs. With them in concord the three-personned Lord is praised by us.

****

Theotokion.

He who is beyond time came forth from you in time, made like us he who is without visible form, and he taught one nature and lordship of the Father, the Son and the Spirit, O Mother of God. Therefore we glorify you.

****

Kathisma. The soldiers watching.

Let us all worship Father, Son and the right Spirit, and the uncreated Trinity, equal in honour and glory, Power beyond godhead, which the ranks of Bodiless Ones glorify. Today let us born of earth faithfully celebrate its praise with fear.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Guide us in the way of repentance, who ever turn aside to the ways of evils that are no ways, and who enrage the Lord, blessed Mary, who did not know wedlock, refuge of humans in despair, dwelling of God.

****

Ode 4. Avvakoum with foreseeing eye.

Divinity of triple sun, shine for me with the splendour of your divine radiance to reveal to the eyes of my heart the beauty of your divine splendour that passes understanding and of your light-creating and sweet participation.

At the first you established the heavens, Lord, and all their power by your almighty Word and by the consubstantial Spirit of your mouth. With them you are Master of the universe in the threefold radiant single might of the Godhead.

As you fashioned me according to your image and your likeness, divine, almighty Trinity, unconfused Unity, give me understanding, enlighten me to do your holy will that is good in strength and perfect.

****

Theotokion.

You gave birth to one of the Trinity, O All-immaculate, the Son wholly divine, embodied for our sake from you, shining on those born of earth with the light that knows no evening and the splendours of the three-sunned Godhead.

****

Ode 5. O Christ who enlightened.

Trinity of wholly single might who shone directly with unapproachable beams upon the first ordered harmony of the Angels, enlighten with your rays the Orthodox who sing your praise.

Now nature, to which you gave being through your loving-kindness, O single Godhead with triple sun, sings your praise as it begs redemption from faults and temptations, dangers and afflictions.

With faith we glorify the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, one nature and Godhead, separate yet inseparable, one God of the invisible and visible creation.

****

Theotokion.

All the sayings of the Prophets depicted beforehand your Offspring ineffable and beyond explanation, O Immaculate. We know him as the one who leads us into the mystery of the single Godhead with triple sun.

****

Ode 6. The deepest abyss.

Trinity beyond being, possessing equal power, Unity in identity of will, you single and undivided. Watch over us therefore by your power.

**Twice.**

As you are good, O incomprehensible Trinity, from non-being you gave existence to all the ages by your will, and then you fashioned mankind. But now too deliver me from every calamity.

****

Theotokion.

You became the house of the unsetting Sun who with infinite strength created and set in order the great lights, immaculate Virgin, Bride of God. But now too deliver me from the gloom of the passions.

****

Kathisma. The soldiers watching.

The holy Trinity and indivisible nature in three persons, divided indivisibly and remaining indivisible in accordance with the essence of the Godhead, let us born of earth worship and glorify as Maker and Master, God supremely good.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Pilot my wretched soul, pure Virgin, and have compassion on it, as it slides under a multitude of offences into the deep of destruction; and at the fearful hour of death snatch me from the accusing demons and from every punishment.

****

Ode 7. We the faithful.

O Word of God, consubstantial radiance of almighty God, as you promised, make me your divine dwelling, as you are compassionate, with your Father and the Spirit, and show me to be terrifying to the demons and the passions.

**Twice.**

That you might reveal to us the ocean of your compassion, Master, you sent your Son to our lowliness and reformed it once again to its ancient splendour. But now too give me understanding by your divine Spirit.

****

Theotokion.

He who rides upon the throne of the Cherubim and is King of all things dwelt in your womb, O Most Pure, rescuing us from corruption as he loves mankind. But now too protect me by your prayers.

****

Ode 8. The furnace moist with dew.

By your divine decree, O Lord of all, three-personned and almighty, you stretched out the heavens like a curtain, and then with your all-powerful hand you suspended the depth of the earth. Therefore also strengthen your servants with your love and faith, O lover of mankind, that with longing we may glorify you to the ages.

**Twice.**

Enlighten, O divine Light, those who sing the praise of the light, three-sunned in persons, yet single in essence, to gaze ever towards your light-giving beams, through which I shall be filled with your sweet, light-creating and all-blessed glory, and with faith highly exalt you to all the ages.

****

Theotokion.

Your Son all pure Mother of God, has exalted to heaven the human nature which without change he took on in his surpassing goodness, having delivered it from its ancient corruption. To him we raise our grateful song: Let all creation bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.

****

Ode 9. The burning bush.

Saviour of the perceptible and conceivable creation, save your servants from the assault and oppression of the hostile, O all-holy and consubstantial Trinity, and preserve your flock for ever unassailed.

**Twice.**

That you might reveal the infinite depth of your innate goodness, you have given to your servants, O three-sunned God of single rule and all-powerful promises. Grant them fulfilment.

****

Theotokion.

Bend to our supplications, only true God believed in in three divine persons, and grant their entreaty to your servants at the prayers of the all pure and all praised Mother of God.

****

And the rest of the Midnight Office and Dismissal.
