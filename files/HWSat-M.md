ON HOLY AND GREAT SATURDAY
==========================

****

The Midnight Office is read in the Church

\[**and not, as usually on weekdays, in the Narthex, or Liti**\] **as
during Great Lent.**

AT MATINS

****

After the Dismissal of the Midnight Office the Priest, having made the
customary metania to the Superior, or to his stall, enters the sanctuary
and makes three bows before the holy Table. He puts on the Epitrachelion
and, standing in front of the holy Table, intones:

Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

Reader:

Amen. ****

The Priest blesses the incense and begins to cense the sanctuary and the
whole church as usual.

The Reader begins:

Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us (

**three times**)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now
and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins.
Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities
for your name’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have
mercy.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now
and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen

Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed; your kingdom come;
your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread,
and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us
into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

****

Priest:

For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen.

Lord, have mercy (

**x12**). Glory. Both now.

Come, let us worship and fall down before the King, our God.\
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ the King, our God.\
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King, our
God.

****

With three metanias; then the following two psalms.

Psalm 19\

May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of
Jacob shield you. May he send you his help from the holy place, and
support you from Sion. May he remember your every sacrifice, and accept
with favour your whole burnt offering. May the Lord give you your
heart’s desire, and fulfil your every purpose. We shall rejoice in your
salvation, and be magnified in the name of our the Lord our God. May the
Lord fulfil all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved his
Christ. He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty acts is the
salvation of his right hand. Some put their trust in chariots and some
in horses, but we will call on the name of the Lord our God. They were
fettered and fell, but we have risen and been set upright. Lord, save
the king, and hear us on the day we call upon you. ****

Psalm 20\

The king will rejoice in your power, O Lord, he will exult exceedingly
in your salvation. You gave him his heart’s desire; you did not deny him
the request of his lips. For you came to meet him with blessings of
goodness; you placed a crown of precious stones upon his head. He asked
you for life, and you gave him length of days for age on age. Great is
his glory because of your salvation; you will place on him glory and
majesty. For you will give him blessing for age on age, and make him
glad with the joy of your countenance. For the king puts his hope in the
Lord, and through the mercy of the Most High he will not be shaken. May
your hand light upon all your enemies, and your right hand find out all
who hate you. You will make them like a blazing oven at the time of your
presence. The Lord will confound them in his wrath and fire will devour
them. You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their seed
from among the children of humankind. Because they intended evils
against you, and devised plans by which they can in no way succeed. For
you will put them to flight; among your remnants you will prepare their
presence. Be exalted, Lord, in your power; we will sing and praise your
mighty acts.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now
and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us (

**three times**)

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now
and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins.
Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities
for your name’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have
mercy.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now
and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen

Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed; your kingdom come;
your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread,
and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us
into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

****

Priest:

For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

The priest must take care that he is standing beneath the Polyeleos to
say this conclusion. He then enters the sanctuary, puts away the censer
and takes his stand in front of the Holy Table.

Reader:

Amen. ****

And the following Troparia:

Lord, save your people, and bless your inheritance, granting your
faithful people victory over their enemies, and guarding your
commonwealth by your Cross.

Glory.

Lifted up on the Cross of your own will, grant you mercies, Christ God,
to the new commonwealth called by your name. Make your faithful people
glad by your power, giving them victory over their enemies. May they
have your help in battle, a weapon of peace, an invincible trophy.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Dread Champion that cannot be put to shame, do not despise our
petitions, O Good One. All-praised Mother of God establish the
commonwealth of the Orthodox, save your people and give them victory
from heaven, for you gave birth to God, O only blessed one.

****

Priest:

Have mercy on us, O God, according to your great mercy. We pray you,
hear and have mercy. ****

Reader:

Lord have mercy (**x3**). ****

Priest:

For you, O God, are merciful, and love humankind, and to you we give
glory, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever and
to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. In the name of the Lord, give the blessing, Father. ****

Priest:

Glory to the holy, consubstantial, life-giving and undivided Trinity,
always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen.

THE SIX PSALMS
--------------

**And we begin the Six Psalms, listening with complete silence and
compunction. The Superior, or the designated reader, with devotion and
fear of God says:**

Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth, goodwill among men (

**x3**).

Lord, you will open my lips: and my mouth will declare your praise (

**x2**). ****

Psalm 3\

Lord, why have those who afflict me been multiplied? Many rise against
me. Many say to my soul, ‘There is no salvation for him in his God’. But
you, Lord, are my helper, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
With my voice, I cried to the Lord, and he heard me from his holy
mountain. I lay down and slept; I awoke, because the Lord will assist
me. I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who surround me.
Rise, Lord, save me, my God; because you have struck all who are vainly
my foes. You have smashed the teeth of sinners. Salvation is the Lord’s,
and your blessing is upon your people. ****

And again:

I lay down and slept; I awoke because the Lord will assist me.

****

Psalm 37\

Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chastise me in your wrath. For
your arrows have been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a heavy hand
upon me. There is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor
peace in my bones on account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my
head; like a heavy burden they weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank
and festered on account of my foolishness. I was wretched and utterly
bowed down; I went about mourning all day long. For my loins were filled
with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh. I was maltreated and
humiliated exceedingly; I howled from the groaning of my heart. Lord,
all my desire is before you, and my groaning was not hidden from you. My
heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and even the light of my eyes
had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and stood
against me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my
life used force, and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and
meditated trickeries all day long. But I, like a deaf man, heard
nothing; like one who is dumb, who does not open his mouth. So I became
like one who cannot hear, and in whose mouth there are no rebukes. For
in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will answer me, O Lord my God. For I
said: Let my foes never exult over me. When my foot slipped they crowed
over me. For I am ready for blows and my pain is with me continually.
For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my sin. But my enemies
live and have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly have
been multiplied. Those who repay me with evils in place of good have
slandered me, since I pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God,
do not go far from me. Hasten to help me, Lord of my salvation. ****

And again.

Do not forsake me, Lord; my God do not go far from me.\
Hasten to help me, Lord of my salvation.

****

Psalm 62\

O God, my God, I watch for you at dawn; my soul has thirsted for you, my
flesh how often in a desert, untrodden and waterless land. Thus I
appeared before you in the holy place, to see your power and your glory.
For your mercy is better than life; my lips will praise you. So I will
bless you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.
May my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; my mouth will praise
you with joyful lips. When I remembered you upon my bed, every dawn I
meditated upon you. For you became my helper, and in the shelter of your
wings I shall rejoice. My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld
me. But those who vainly sought my life will go down to the deepest
parts of the earth, they will be delivered to the power of the sword,
they will be portions for foxes. But the king will rejoice in God, and
all who swear by him will be praised; for the mouths of those who speak
iniquities have been stopped. ****

And again.

Every dawn I meditated upon you, for you became my helper, and in the
shelter of your wings I shall rejoice.\
My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld me.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit. Both now and
for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God (

**x3, without Metanias**). Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord,
have mercy.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit. Both now and
for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Psalm 87\

Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day, and by night also before
you. Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to my
supplication. For my soul was filled with evils, and my life drew near
to Hell. I was reckoned among those that go down to the Pit; I became as
one that has no help, free among the dead. Like the slain that sleep in
the tomb, whom you remembered no more; and they were cut off from your
power. They placed me in the lowest Pit; in darkness and in the shadow
of death. Your wrath lay heavy upon me, and you brought all your waves
against me. You put my friends far from me, and made me an abomination
to them. I was handed over and I came out; my eyes grew weak because of
my beggary. I cried to you, Lord, all the day; I stretched out my hands
towards you. Will you work wonders for the dead; or will physicians
raise them up again to praise you? Will any declare your mercy in the
tomb, or your truth in the place of destruction? Will your wonders be
known in the dark, or your justice in a land that has been forgotten?
But to you, Lord, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer will come
before you. Why have you rejected my soul, Lord; why do you turn away
your face from me? I am poor and in toils since my youth; exalted, I was
humbled and brought to despair. Your fierce anger overwhelmed me, and
your terrors appalled me. They surrounded me like water all day long;
they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour you have
put far from me, and my companions because of my misery. ****

And again.

Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day; and by night also before
you.\
Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn your ear to my
supplication.

****

The priest comes from the Altar and reads the morning prayers quietly.

Psalm 102\

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy
name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of his benefits. He
forgives all your iniquities; he heals all your diseases; he redeems
your life from corruption and crowns you with mercy and compassion; he
satisfies your desire with good things; your youth will be renewed like
an eagle’s. The Lord performs deeds of mercy and judgement for all who
are oppressed. He made known his ways to Moses, his wishes to the
children of Israel. The Lord is compassionate and merciful,
long-suffering and full of mercy. He will not always be wrathful, nor
will he be enraged for ever. He has not dealt with us according to our
iniquities, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For, like the height
of heaven above the earth, the Lord has made his mercy prevail over
those that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he
taken our sins from us. As a father takes pity on his children the Lord
has taken pity on those who fear him. For he knows of what we are made;
has remembered that we are but dust. As for man, his days are but as
grass, he will blossom like a flower of the field; for when a wind has
passed over it, it will be no more and will know its place no longer.
But the mercy of the Lord is for ever and ever upon those who fear him;
and his justice upon their children’s children, upon those who keep his
covenant and remember his commandments to do them. The Lord has prepared
his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Bless the Lord, all
you his Angels, powerful in strength, who perform his word, and listen
to the voice of his words. Bless the Lord, all you his Powers, his
Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord, all you his works. In every
place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul! ****

And again.

In every place of his dominion: bless the Lord, O my soul!

****

Psalm 142

\
Lord, hear my prayer: in your truth give ear to my supplication, and in
your justice hear me. Do not enter into judgement with your servant: for
in your sight no one living can be justified. For the enemy pursued my
soul, humbled my life to the ground. Made me dwell in darkness, like
those for ever dead. My spirit grew despondent within me and my heart
within me was troubled. I remembered days of old, I meditated on all
your works: I made the works of your hands my meditation. I stretched
out my hands towards you: my soul thirsted for you like a waterless
land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord, my spirit has failed. Do not turn your
face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me
hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known
to me the way in which I should walk, for to you I have lifted up my
soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord: I have run to you for shelter.
Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit will
guide me in an upright land. For your name’s sake, O Lord, you will give
me life. In your justice, you will bring my soul out of trouble, in your
mercy slay my enemies, and destroy all those that afflict my soul, for I
am your servant. ****

And again.

In your justice hear me, O Lord, and do not enter into judgement with
your servant. (

**x2**)\
Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit.

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

Amen. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God (

**x3**). **Metanias** (**x3**) ****

Then the Litany by the Priest, outside the Sanctuary.

In peace, let us pray to the Lord.

****

People:

Lord, have mercy. And so after each petition.

For the peace from on high and for the salvation of our souls, let us
pray to the Lord.

For the peace of the whole world, for the welfare of the holy Churches
of God, and for the union of all, let us pray to the Lord.

For this holy house, and for those who enter it with faith, reverence
and the fear of God, let us pray to the Lord.

For our Archbishop

**N**., for the honoured order of presbyters, for the diaconate in
Christ, for all the clergy and the people, let us pray to the Lord.

\[For our Sovereign Lady, Queen Elizabeth, the Royal Family, her
Government, and all in authority, let us pray to the Lord.

For our Father and Abbot

**N**. and for all our brotherhood in Christ, let us pray to the Lord.\]

For this holy monastery, for every monastery, city, town and village,
and for the faithful who dwell in them, let us pray to the Lord.

For favourable weather, an abundance of the fruits of the earth, and
temperate seasons, let us pray to the Lord.

For those who travel by land, air or water, for the sick, the suffering,
for those in captivity, and for their safety and salvation, let us pray
to the Lord.

For our deliverance from all affliction, wrath, danger and constraint,
let us pray to the Lord.

Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by your grace.

Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most blessed and glorious Lady, Mother
of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, with all the Saints, let us entrust
ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God.

****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

Priest:

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

People:

Amen. ****

Then we sing in Tone 2:

The Lord is God, and has appeared to us; blessed is he who comes in the
name of the Lord.

****

Verse 1:

Give thanks to the Lord for he is good; and his mercy endures for ever.
****

Verse 2:

All the nations surrounded me and in the name of the Lord I drove them
back. ****

Verse 3:

This is the Lord’s doing and it is marvellous in our eyes. ****

Apolytikia. Tone 2.

The noble Joseph, taking down your most pure Body from the Tree, wrapped
it in a clean shroud with sweet spices and laid it for burial in a new
grave.

Glory.

When you went down to death, O immortal life, then you slew Hell with
the lightning flash of your Godhead; but when from the depths below the
earth you raised the dead, all the Powers beyond the heavens cried out:
Giver of life, Christ our God, glory to you!

Both now.

The Angel standing by the grave cried to the women bearing myrrh: Myrrh
is fitting for the dead, but Christ has shown himself a stranger to
corruption.

FIRST SECTION
-------------

**Tone 5**\
Blessed are you, O Lord, teach me your statutes.

Blessed are the blameless in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.

In the tomb they laid you,\
you, O Christ, who are Life;\
in amazement angel armies lift up their song\
as they glorify your self-abasement, Lord.

Blessed are those who search out his testimonies, they will seek for him
with their whole heart.

Life, how can you perish,\
or how dwell in a tomb?\
Yet the royal hall of Death you now bring to nought,\
and from Hades’ realm you raise the dead again.

For the workers of iniquity have not walked in his ways.

Now we magnify you,\
O Lord Jesu, our King,\
we pay honour to your Passion and burial\
for from foul corruption you saved us through them.

You have commanded that your commandments be strictly kept.

King of all, O Jesu,\
who established earth’s bounds,\
on this day you make your home in a little tomb,\
raising up the dead of ages from their graves.

Would that my ways might be directed to keep your statutes.

O my Christ, my Jesus,\
king and monarch of all,\
seeking what have you descended to those in Hell?\
Was it not to liberate the mortal race?

Then I should not be ashamed when I look on all your commandments.

He who governs all things\
here is seen as a corpse,\
new the grave in which his body is laid to rest,\
he the one who empties graves of all their dead.

I shall confess you in uprightness of heart, when I have learned the
judgements of your justice.

In the tomb they laid you,\
you, O Christ, who are Life;\
death itself you brought to nothing by your own death,\
and became the fount of life for all the world.

I shall keep your statutes, do not utterly forsake me.

Guilty with the guilty\
you were judged, O my Christ,\
at the moment you wrought justice for all of us,\
from the ancient trickster’s foul and evil deeds.

How will a young man correct his way? By keeping your words.

Fairer he in beauty\
than are all mortal kind,\
now a corpse we see, unsightly, bereft of form,\
he who beautified the nature of all things.

I have sought you with my whole heart, do not drive me from your
commandments.

How could Hell endure it,\
When in splendour you came,\
and how not be swiftly shattered and plunged in dark,\
blinded by the blazing glory of your light?

I have hidden your words in my heart, that I may not sin against you.

Light that saves, O Jesu,\
you are sweetness to me,\
in the darkness of the grave how can you lie hid,\
O forbearance that no language can express!

Blessed are you, O Lord, teach me your statutes.

Angels are bewildered,\
and the bodiless host\
at a loss, O Christ, before that great mystery\
your ineffable entombment, beyond speech.

With my lips I have declared all the judgements of your mouth.

O most strange of wonders,\
What new deeds we now see!\
He who gave me my life’s breath, lies unbreathing now\
born to burial at noble Joseph’s hands.

I have been delighted by the way of your testimonies, as by all wealth.

Like the sun when setting,\
to the tomb you descend,\
yet, O Christ, your Father’s bosom you do not leave,\
What strange paradox, what wondrous thing this is.

I shall reflect on your commandments and consider your ways.

As the sky’s true monarch,\
as true king of the earth,\
Though enclosed within the narrowest sepulchre\
you were known by all creation, Jesu, Lord.

I shall meditate on your statutes, I shall not forget your words.

In the tomb they laid you,\
Christ the maker of all,\
then were Hell’s foundations shaken, they tremble now,\
as the graves of mortal kind are opened wide.

A recompense for your servant: make me live and I shall keep your ways.

He who in the hollow\
of his hand holds the earth,\
in the flesh is put to death and lies in earth’s grasp,\
as he now redeems the dead from Hades’ grip.

Unveil my eyes, and I shall consider the wonders of your law.

You rose from corruption\
O my saviour, my life,\
having died and gone to dwell there among the dead,\
smashed and shattered Hades’ brazen bolts and bars.

I am a pilgrim on the earth; do not hide your commandments from me.

Like a burning lampstand\
here the flesh of our God,\
as beneath a bushel measure, now lies concealed\
under earth and puts the gloom of Hell to flight.

My soul has longed to desire your judgements at all times.

Nothing can contain you,\
yet the Heavenly hosts,\
with the noble Joseph and with Nicodemus now\
hasten to enclose you in a little grave.

You have rebuked the proud; those who turn aside from your law are
cursed.

Willingly, my Jesus,\
slain and laid underground,\
fount of life, you gave me life when I lay in death,\
when by bitterest transgressions I was slain.

Take reproach and contempt from me, for I have sought your testimonies.

By your Passion, Jesu,\
all creation was changed,\
all things suffered with you, Word, knowing you to be\
the Maintainer and Sustainer of the world.

For rulers sat and spoke against me, but your servant reflected on your
statutes.

Death who eats up all things\
swallowed you, Rock of Life,\
when you entered in his belly he vomited\
spewing forth the dead gulped down from every age.

For your testimonies are my meditation, and your statutes my counsels.

There, O Christ, they laid you,\
in a newly made grave,\
and the nature of us mortals you then renewed,\
when from death you rose in majesty divine.

My soul has been stuck to the ground; make me live according to your
word.

Down to earth, O Master,\
to save Adam you came,\
and not finding him on earth, you descended, Lord,\
to the depths of Hades, searching for him there.

I declared my ways, and you heard me: teach me your statutes.

All the earth was shaken\
and it trembled in fear,\
and the light-bearer, O Word, hid its rays away\
to see you, the greatest Light, hid in the earth.

Make me understand the way of your statutes, and I shall reflect on your
wonders.

Willingly as mortal,\
O my Saviour, you die,\
but as God you raised the dead back to life again,\
from their graves and the abysmal depths of sin.

My soul slumbered from listlessness, strengthen me by your words.

Tears of lamentation\
she pours out over you,\
as your mother the pure Virgin, O Jesu, cries,\
How, my son, am I to lay you in the tomb?

Remove the way of injustice from me and by your law have mercy on me.

Like a wheat grain buried\
in the bosom of Earth,\
you have yielded harvest in great abundance, Lord,\
raising up all Adam’s mortal progeny.

I have chosen the way of truth, and have not forgotten your judgements.

Now you have been hidden\
like the sun ‘neath the earth\
and been covered over, veiled by the night of death.\
Dawn again, O, Saviour, dawn more brightly yet.

I have clung to your testimonies, O Lord; do not put me to shame.

As the moon eclipses\
the sun’s disk, Saviour Lord,\
now the sepulchre has hidden you from our eyes,\
in the flesh you undergo eclipse by death.

I ran in the way of your testimonies, when you set my heart at large.

Life itself, Christ Saviour,\
having tasted of death,\
freed all mortal kind from death, liberated us,\
and the gift of life he now bestows on all.

Lay down for me, O Lord, the way of your statutes, and I shall always
seek it.

By your death, O Saviour,\
you lead back into life\
Adam, who of old by envy was brought to death,\
as in flesh as a new Adam you appear.

Make me understand, and I shall search out your law and keep it with my
whole heart.

The angelic orders,\
were amazed to behold\
you, our Saviour, for our sake laid out as a corpse\
with their wings they veil their faces from the sight.

Guide me in the path of your commandments, for that is what I have
wanted.

Noble Joseph takes you,\
as a corpse, from the Tree,\
new the grave, O Word, in which he now buries you,\
But as God arise , save all of human kind!

Incline my heart to your testimonies and not to covetousness.

To the angels, Saviour,\
you are gladness and joy,\
but a cause of grief you now have become to them,\
as they see you in the flesh a lifeless corpse.

Turn my eyes from seeing vanities; give me life in your way.

Lord you lift up with you,\
lifted up on the Tree,\
every living mortal, but now laid under earth\
all who lie beneath it you raise up again.

Establish your word for your servant, for him to fear you.

In the flesh, O Saviour,\
like a lion you slept,\
as a lion cub he rises, our Mighty Dead,\
sloughing off the flesh’s feebleness and age.

Take away my reproach, which I dreaded; for your judgements are good.

Mother Eve you fashioned\
from a rib, which you took\
from the side of Adam, Lord, now your side is pierced,\
and from thence there gush forth purifying streams.

See, I have longed for your commandments; in your justice make me live.

Sacrificed in secret,\
was the lamb slain of old,\
under open skies, O Saviour long-suffering,\
cleansing all creation, you were sacrificed.

Let your mercy come upon me, O Lord, your salvation according to your
word.

Who is there can tell it,\
this dread thing, truly new:\
see, the Master of creation today accepts\
death and suffering, and dies now for our sake.

And I shall answer those who reproach me that I have hoped in your
words.

‘How can life’s Dispenser\
now be seen as a corpse?’\
cried the Angels in amazement, ‘How can our God\
be confined here, be shut up within a grave?’

Do not take the word of truth utterly from my mouth, because I have
hoped in your judgements.

When the lance, O Saviour,\
pierced your side, you let fall\
drops of life on Eve, who from life had banished me,\
giving life to her you gave me life as well.

And I shall keep your law always, for ever and for ever.

Mortal kind you gathered\
into one, Jesus, Lord,\
when stretched out upon the Tree, and your side was pierced\
from that life-source you pour pardon forth for all.

And I walked in freedom, because I sought your commandments.

Noble Joseph, Saviour,\
filled with dread lays you out,\
nobly readies you and buries you as a corpse,\
trembling awe-struck at the sight of your dread form.

And I spoke of your testimonies before kings and was not ashamed.

Willingly as mortal,\
you went down ‘neath the earth;\
from the earth’s depths you lead back up to Heaven’s height\
all of those, O Jesu who lay fallen there.

And I meditated on your commandments, which I loved greatly.

Though a corpse we see you,\
yet alive as our God\
you gave life again to mortals who once were slain,\
put to death the one who brought me to my death.

And I lifted up my hands to your commandments which I loved, and
reflected on your statutes.

O the joy, the gladness,\
O the boundless delight,\
with which, Jesu, you filled those who lay bound in Hell,\
when you made light blaze throughout its murky depths.

Remember your words to your servant, by which you gave me hope.

Lord, your pains I worship,\
and your burial praise,\
and I magnify your might, Lover of mankind.\
By them I am freed from passions which destroy.

This comforted me in my humiliation, that your word had given me life.

A great sword was sharpened\
against you, O my Christ,\
but the strong one’s mighty sword has been blunted now,\
and the sword that guarded Eden is turned back.

The proud have utterly transgressed; but I have not swerved from your
law.

When the Ewe that bore him\
saw the Lamb that was slain,\
shot with anguish she lamented and cried aloud,\
rousing all the flock to join its cry to hers.

I remembered your judgements of old, Lord, and I was comforted.

Buried in a tomb, Lord,\
and descended to Hell,\
yet, O Saviour, you have emptied the sepulchres,\
mighty Hades you stripped naked, O my Christ.

Dejection has taken hold of me because of sinners, who abandon your law.

Willingly, O Saviour,\
you went down ‘neath the earth,\
granted life again to mortals whom death had slain,\
in the glory of the Father led them up.

Your statutes have been my songs in the place of my pilgrimage.

Shameful death he suffered\
in the flesh for our sake,\
who is one of the divine holy Trinity.\
Quails the sun, and all earth shudders at the sight.

I remembered your name in the night, Lord, and I kept your law.

From the tribe of Judah\
from that bitterest source,\
came the offspring who cast Jesus into the pit,\
him who furnished them with manna for their food.

This happened to me, because I sought your statutes.

[]{#March26}Judge he stands for judgement\
before Pilate as judge,\
and the unjust judge condemns him to unjust death,\
to be put to death upon that Tree, the Cross.

You, Lord, are my portion; I have said that I would keep your law.

Why so boastful Israel,\
people tainted with blood?\
why did you deliver Barabbas from his pains,\
yet hand over Christ the Saviour to a Cross?

I have begged for your presence with my whole heart; have mercy on me
according to your word.

With your hand you fashioned\
Adam out of the earth;\
for him you became by nature a man, O Lord,\
and were crucified for him by your own will.

I have thought over your ways and turned back my feet to your
testimonies.

You obeyed your Father,\
and descended, O Word,\
to the depth of dreadful Hell, to the realm of Death,\
and raised up again the race of mortal kind.

I was prepared, and not troubled, to keep your commandments.

Bitterly lamenting,\
‘Woe is me, O my light!\
my heart’s longing and the Light of the World, alas!\
Woe is me, my heart’s desire’, the Virgin cried.

The cords of sinners entangled me, and I did not forget your law.

Murderous, malicious,\
men whose deeds for vengeance cry!\
See the graveclothes and the napkin left lying here,\
as Christ rises from the dead: are you not shamed?

At midnight I rose to confess you, for the judgements of your justice.

Murdering disciple,\
blood-stained man, show me now\
all the manner, all the ways of your wickedness,\
through which you became betrayer of our Christ.

I am a companion of all who fear you and keep your commandments.

Monster of destruction,\
blind, implacable fool!\
How can you pretend to act from philanthropy,\
when you sold the Myrrh for thirty silver pence?

The earth is full of your mercy, O Lord; teach me your statutes.

How much did they pay you\
for the heavenly Myrrh?\
What did you receive as price of the precious One?\
You found raving madness, Satan, most accursed.

You have shown goodness to your servant, O Lord, according to your word.

If you suffered anguish\
as a friend of the poor,\
when for mercy on a soul precious myrrh was poured,\
how, then, can you sell the fount of light for gold?

Teach me goodness, discipline and knowledge, because I have believed
your commandments.

‘O God’s Word, my gladness,\
my Lord and my God,\
how can I endure your burial for three days?\
As a mother now my heart is torn with grief.’

Before I was disciplined I offended; for this reason I have kept your
word.

‘Who will give me water,\
give me fountains of tears,’\
cried the Virgin bride of God, ‘that I may lament\
and may weep for my sweet Jesus, who lies slain?’

You are good, O Lord, and in your goodness teach me your statutes.

‘Mountain heights and valleys,\
all the whole human race,\
come, all creatures, come lament and shed tears with me,\
weep with me, who am the Mother of your God.’

The injustice of the proud has been heaped upon me, but with my whole
heart I shall search out your commandments.

‘Saviour, light eternal,\
the delight of my heart,\
when shall I see you, my gladness, my only joy?’\
cried the Virgin most afflicted in her grief.

Their heart has curdled like milk; but I have meditated on your law.

Like a rock, O Saviour,\
sharp and flinty and hard,\
you received the blow, but poured forth, as source of life,\
streams of living water, bringing life to all.

It is good that you disciplined me, that I might learn your statutes.

As if from one fountain\
as from only one spring,\
from the double stream that flows from your side we drink,\
and we pluck the fruit that grants immortal life.

The law of your mouth is good to me, beyond thousands of gold and
silver.

By your will we see you,\
as a corpse in the tomb,\
but you live, O Word, and Saviour as you foretold,\
by your Resurrection you raise mortal kind.

Glory.

Word, we sing your praises,\
as the Lord God of all,\
with the Father and your most Holy Spirit, Lord,\
and we glorify your burial divine.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Now we call you blessed,\
All-Pure Mother of God,\
and in faith we hold in honour and venerate\
the three day entombment of your Son our God.

****

And the first Troparion again.

In the tomb they laid you,\
you, O Christ, who are Life,\
in amazement angel armies lift up their song\
as they glorify your self-abasement, Lord.

****

And at once:

Priest:

Again and again in peace, let us pray to the Lord. ****

Reader:

Lord, have mercy. ****

Priest:

Help us, save us, have mercy on us and keep us, O God, by your grace.

Tone 5.

It is right indeed\
we should magnify the one who grants life,\
you, that stretched your hands wide upon the Cross,\
broke and smashed the might and power of the foe.

Your hands made me and fashioned me; make me understand and I shall
learn your commandments.

It is right indeed\
you to magnify, who fashion all things,\
your pains from corruption deliver us,\
and your Passion grants dispassion to our souls.

Those who fear you will see me and be glad, because I have hoped in your
words.

All Earth quaked in fear\
and the sun concealed itself, O Saviour,\
when, O Christ, our light, you set bodily,\
as the light that knows no evening was entombed.

I know, Lord, that your judgements are justice, and that in truth you
disciplined me.

Sleeping in the tomb\
with the sleep that breathes forth life, Anointed,\
from sin’s heavy sleep you, as God, aroused\
all the human race that sin had held enthralled.

Oh let your mercy be for my comfort, according to your word to your
servant.

‘Of all woman-kind\
I alone bore you, my child, without pain;\
cruel pangs now wrack me as I behold\
your great suffering’, the Holy Virgin cries.

Let your mercies come to me, and I shall live, because your law is my
meditation.

Seeing you on high,\
never separated from the Father,\
yet below on Earth, laid out as a corpse,\
the dread Seraphim, my Saviour, shake with fear.

Let the proud be shamed, for they have wronged me unjustly; but I shall
meditate on your commandments.

See, the Temple Veil,\
rent asunder at your crucifixion,\
Heaven’s beacons hide, O my Christ, their light,\
to see you, the Sun, now hid beneath the earth.

Let those who fear you and know your testimonies turn back to me.

He who at the start\
by His will alone set Earth revolving,\
lifeless as a mortal sets under earth;\
let the sky now shake and tremble at the sight.

Let my heart become blameless in your statutes, that I may not be
ashamed.

Human-kind you formed,\
with your own hand fashioned us, O Saviour,\
now, O Sun, you set underneath the earth,\
raising companies of mortals from the fall.

My soul faints for your salvation, I have hoped in your words.

Come, now, let us sing,\
let our sacred hymn lament the dead Christ,\
singing as the Myrrh-bearing women did,\
that with them we too may hear the word ‘rejoice!’

My eyes have fainted for your word, saying: When will you comfort me?

Truly you are Myrrh,\
truly, Word of God, the Myrrh Unfailing,\
so it was myrrh-bearers brought myrrh to you,\
to the Living God brought myrrh as to the dead.

Because I have become like a wineskin in the frost, I have not forgotten
your statutes.

Buried, O my Christ,\
the great palaces of Hell you shattered,\
Death you put to death by your death, O Lord,\
from corruption you set free those born of earth.

How many are your servant’s days? When will you execute judgement on my
persecutors?

To the grave descends\
he, the Wisdom of our God, that pours out\
streams of life; descending into a tomb,\
giving life to those in Hades deepest depths.

The lawless have told me fables, but nothing like your law, O Lord.\
‘Willingly by death\
I was wounded in the flesh, dear Mother,,\
thus the broken nature of mortal kind\
to renew, so do not beat your breast in grief.’

All your commandments are truth; they have persecuted me unjustly, help
me.

When beneath the Earth\
you had set, the Morning Star of justice,\
you aroused the dead as if they but slept,\
as you put to flight the murk and gloom of Hell.

They almost made an end of me on earth, but I did not abandon your
commandments.

Sown with tears today,\
the life-breathing grain of two-fold nature,\
here within earth’s furrows the grain is sown,\
but tomorrow it will burst once more to life.

Give me life according to your mercy, and I shall keep the testimonies
of your mouth.

Trembling, Adam quailed,\
when God walked in Paradise, he feared him,\
but rejoices now as God enters Hell.\
As of old he fell, so now he rises up.

O Lord, your word endures for ever in heaven.

Offerings of tears,\
O my Christ, your Mother poured out, weeping,\
as in flesh you lay buried in the grave,\
‘But arise, my Son, as you foretold’, she cried.

Your truth from generation to generation; you founded the earth and it
endures.

Filled with godly fear,\
in a new tomb noble Joseph hides you,\
singing, Saviour, hymns for your burial,\
hymns befitting God and mingled with laments.

By your decree day endures; because all things are your servants.

Bolts of bitter grief\
pierced you Mother’s soul, and nails of anguish,\
when she saw you nailed to a Tree, O Word,\
saw you fastened to the Cross with cruel nails.

If your law had not been my meditation, I would have perished in my
humiliation.

When her eyes beheld\
you who are the whole world’s sweetness,\
drinking, O my Saviour, the bitter drink,\
your sweet Mother drenched her eyes with bitter tears.

I will never forget your statutes, because through them you have given
me life.

‘Dreadful is the wound,\
all my inward parts are rent asunder,\
as your unjust slaughter I see, O Word’,\
cried the Virgin most afflicted as she wept.

I am yours, save me, for I have sought your statutes.

‘Tell me, Word of God,\
how am I to close you lips and sweet eyes,\
how to bury you as befits the dead?’\
cried the noble Joseph, shivering with fear.

Sinners waited for me to destroy me; I understood your testimonies.

Sacred hymns they sing,\
Nicodemus and the noble Joseph,\
while the Seraphim join them in their hymn\
for the burial of Christ, who now lies dead.

I have seen an end of every perfection, your commandment is exceedingly
broad.

Sun of justice, now\
you have set beneath the earth, my Saviour,\
Therefore she, the Moon that gave birth to you,\
is eclipsed with grief, at seeing you no more.

How I have loved your law, O Lord; all day it is my meditation.

Hades trembled then,\
when he saw you, the Life-giving Saviour,\
in your might despoiling him of his wealth,\
raising up the dead he held from every age.

By your commandment you have made me wiser than my foes, for it is mine
for ever.

Once the night has passed\
then again, O Word, the bright Sun blazes;\
radiant you blaze forth, when after death,\
as though from a bridal chamber, you arise.

I have understood more than all those who teach me, for your testimonies
are my meditation.

How Earth quaked with fear,\
O Creator, as into her bosom,\
shaking, she received you, my Saving Lord,\
by her fearful shaking she awoke the dead.

I have understood more than my elders, for I have sought your
commandments.

With sweet myrrh, O Christ,\
Nicodemus and the noble Joseph\
laid you out for burial strange and new,\
as they cried aloud, ‘Now tremble, all the earth!’

I restrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep your words.

Maker of the light,\
you have set, and with you sets the sunlight;\
all creation, trembling and shuddering,\
now proclaims you as the Maker all things.

I did not turn from your judgements, for you gave me your law.

Christ, our Cornerstone,\
Him a stone hewn from the rock now covers;\
Tremble Earth to see how a mortal man\
hides away our God as mortal in a tomb!

How sweet are your words to my throat, sweeter than honey to my mouth.

‘O my Child, behold\
the disciple whom you loved; my sweet one,\
see your Mother too, and grant us a word’,\
cried the Virgin as she raised her sad lament.

From your commandments I gained understanding; therefore I hated every
way of injustice.

O, Life-giving Word,\
even stretched out on the Cross and nailed there,\
you, as Lord of Life, did not kill the Jews,\
granting resurrection even to their dead.

Your law is a lamp for my feet and a light for my paths.\
Suffering, O Word,\
you were quite bereft of form and beauty;\
Rising, Lord, you shone forth resplendently,\
and with your Godhead’s rays made mortals fair.

I have sworn and am determined to keep the judgements of your justice.

In the flesh you set,\
‘neath the earth, Dawn Star that knows no evening,\
at height of noon-day the sun grew dark,\
as unable to endure the fearful sight.

I have been exceedingly humbled; O Lord, give me life according to your
word.

Sun and moon grew dark,\
they are images of faithful servants,\
who, as mourners, Saviour, attire themselves\
in the sombre mourners’ robes of deepest black.

Be well pleased, Lord, with the freewill offerings of my mouth, and
teach me your judgements.

‘Though you hung there dead,\
the centurion knew you as true God.\
‘See, with fear I shake’, noble Joseph cried,\
Tell me, how am I to touch you with my hands?’

My soul is ever in your hands, and I have not forgotten your law.

Adam lay asleep,\
and, while sleeping, from his side brought forth death.\
You, O Word of God, who are sleeping here,\
now are pouring from your side life for the world.

Sinners laid a snare for me, and I have not strayed from your
commandments.

For a while you slept,\
to the dead who lay in Hell you brought life.\
Rising up, O Good One, you then raised up\
all the multitudes of dead from every age.

I have inherited your testimonies for ever, for they are the joy of my
heart.

Vine from which life flows!\
As above the earth, Lord, you were lifted,\
you poured forth the wine of salvation then,\
now I glorify your Passion and your Cross.

I have inclined my heart to do your statutes for ever for the sake of
the recompense.

Lords of Angel Hosts,\
when they saw you, O my Saviour, naked,\
blood-stained, and condemned, how did they endure\
to perceive your crucifiers’ insolence?

I have hated transgressors, but I have loved your law.

What perversity!\
Come, most crooked race of Hebrews, tell us,\
how could you condemn the Anointed One,\
when you knew the temple would be raised again.

You are my helper and protector; I have hoped in your words.

In a mocking cloak\
you have clothed the one who orders all things.\
He arrayed the Earth, and most wondrously,\
he it was who strewed the stars across the skies.

Depart from me all evil-doers, and I shall search out the commandments
of my God.

Like the pelican,\
you gave life, O Word, to your dead children,\
wounded in your side, you let life-blood flow,\
letting fall life-giving drops of blood on all.

Help me according to your word, and give me life, and may I not be
disappointed in my expectation.

Jesus stayed the sun,\
as of old he smote the foreign foe, Lord;\
you, Christ, hid its light as you overthrew\
that great prince, the Lord of darkness and of death.

Help me and I shall be saved and I shall ever meditate on your statutes.

O Compassionate,\
while remaining in your Father’s bosom,\
mortal nature willingly you assumed,\
and as mortal man, O Christ, went down to Hell.

You have despised all those who abandon your statutes, because their
desire is unjust.

He who hung the earth\
on the waters, on a Cross is lifted,\
as a lifeless corpse he is laid in earth,\
which, unable to endure it, dreads and quakes.

I reckoned all the sinners on earth as transgressors; that is why I have
loved your testimonies.

‘Woe is me, my Son!\
For I hoped as king to see you reigning,\
whom I see condemned, hanging on the Cross’,\
the pure Virgin Mother voices her lament .’

Nail my flesh with fear of you; for I was afraid of your judgements.

‘Gabriel announced,\
in the wondrous message that he brought me,\
the eternal kingdom he said would be\
the possession of my Jesus, my dear Son’.

I have done judgement and justice; do not hand me over to those who
injure me.

‘Woe, alas for me!\
Now a prophecy has found fulfilment,\
As the just man Symeon had foretold,\
now, Emmanuel, your sword has pierced my heart.’

Be responsible for your servant’s good; do not let the proud slander me.

Are you not ashamed?\
Tell me, do not all those dead he raised up\
shame you, for the Giver of life is he,\
whom from spiteful envy, Jews, you did to death .

My eyes have grown weak looking for your salvation and the word of your
justice.

Bitterly she wept,\
your all-blameless Mother, when she saw you\
lying dead, O Word, lying in the tomb,\
the eternal God no language can express.

Deal with your servant according to your mercy and teach me your
statutes.

Seeing you, my Christ,\
you, the Light invisible, now hidden,\
lifeless in the grave, then the sun on high\
shook and trembled as its light grew dark in fear.

I am your servant; make me understand, and I shall know your
testimonies.

When she saw your death\
then your Mother free from all defilement\
cried out, O my Christ, bitterly to you,\
‘Life, I beg, do not delay among the dead!’

It is time for the Lord to act; they have thrown your law to the winds.

Hades, death’s dread lord,\
shook in fear, he shuddered when he saw you,\
Sun of glory, deathless and radiant,\
and he gave up all his prisoners in haste.

That is why I have loved your commandments above gold and topaz.

Terrible indeed,\
great the sight that now is seen, O Saviour,\
He, the cause of life, willing went to death,\
wishing life to bring as gift to all mankind.

That is why I have been directed to all your commandments, hated every
unjust way.

Lord, your side was pierced,\
nails were hammered through your hands, O Saviour,\
from your side came healing to heal the wound,\
and to cure the greed of our first parents’ hands.

Your testimonies are wonderful; that is why my soul has searched them
out.

Once for Rachel’s son\
house by house were all set sadly weeping.\
With his Mother now, the Disciples’ choir\
in its grief mourns and laments the Virgin’s Son.

The expounding of your law enlightens and makes little children
understand.

With their hands they gave\
a great blow upon the cheek of Jesus,\
Christ, who with his hand fashioned all mankind\
Christ, who with his hand has crushed the Beast’s foul fangs.

I opened my mouth and drew breath, because I longed for your
commandments.

With our hymns, O Christ,\
all the faithful bring their adoration,\
to your crucifixion and burial;\
by your burial we have been freed from death.

Glory.

Great eternal God,\
co-eternal Word and Holy Spirit,\
look down in your goodness on those who rule,\
grant their sceptres strength against the warlike foe.

Both now.

Wholly undefiled,\
Mother, who gave birth to life, pure Virgin,\
ends all scandals which still beset Church,\
and as you are loving, Mother, grant her peace.

****

And again the first Troparion.

It is right indeed\
we should magnify the one who grants life,\
you, that stretched your hands wide upon the Cross,\
broke and smashed the might and power of the foe.

****

And at once:

Priest:

Again and again in peace, let us pray to the Lord. ****

Reader:

Lord, have mercy. ****

Priest:

Help us, save us, have mercy on us and keep us, O God, by your grace.

**Tone 3**

Each generation offers,\
my Christ, for your entombment\
in hymns and songs its praises.

Look upon me and have mercy upon me according to the judgement of those
who love your name.

The Noble Joseph takes you\
down from the Tree, my Saviour,\
and in the tomb he lays you.

Direct my steps according to your word, and do not let iniquity lord it
over me.

Myrrh-bearing Woman came then,\
providently bringing\
to you, O Christ, the sweet myrrh.

Deliver me from the slander of men, and I shall keep your commandments.

Let all Creation join us,\
as to the Creator\
our farewell hymns we now sing.

Make your face shine on your servant and teach me your statutes.

With myrrh-bearing women\
let us, with understanding,\
anoint as dead the Living.

My eyes shed streams of water, when I did not keep your law.

O thrice-blessed Joseph,\
entomb Messiah’s body,\
the corpse of Him who grants life.

You are just, O Lord, and your judgements are upright.

Those he fed with manna\
raised their heels against him,\
against the Benefactor.

You have commanded justice, your testimonies and absolute truth.

Those he fed with manna\
bring vinegar and gall now\
to offer to the Saviour..

Your zeal has burned me up, because my enemies have forgotten your
words.

O the boundless folly\
of those who slew the prophets\
and now slay God’s Anointed.

Your word has been thoroughly tried by fire, and your servant has loved
it.

Initiate yet traitor,\
he, the senseless servant,\
sold the Abyss of Wisdom.

I am young and despised; I have not forgotten your statutes.

Judas the deceiver\
for silver sold the Saviour,\
and thus became a captive.

Your justice is justice forever, and your law is truth.

Solomon declared it:\
like a deep-dug pit the mouth\
of Law-transgressing Hebrews.

Troubles and constraints have found me, your commandments are my
meditation.

Law-transgressing Hebrews\
on the crooked paths they tread\
face pits and traps and sharp snares.

Your testimonies are justice forever; make me understand, and I shall
live.

With Nicodemus, Joseph\
buries the Creator\
as for the dead is fitting.

I have cried to you with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord, I shall seek
out your statutes.

O Life-giving Saviour,\
the conqueror of Hades,\
to your great might be glory.

I have cried to you; save me, and I shall keep your testimonies.

When the All-Pure saw you\
lying limp and dead, Lord,\
as mother, Word, she mourned you.

I have risen at dead of night and cried out, I have hoped in your words.

‘O my sweetest springtime,\
O my sweetest Offspring,\
where has your beauty vanished?’

My eyes have forestalled the dawn, to meditate on your words.

What sad lament she raises,\
O Word, your all-pure Mother,\
as you lie dead before her.

Hear my voice, O Lord, according to your mercy, according to your
judgement give me life.

Women with sweet myrrh came\
to anoint with myrrh Christ,\
who is himself Divine Myrrh.

Those who persecute me have drawn near iniquity, they have gone far from
your law.

Death itself, O Saviour,\
by death you put to death, Lord\
my God, by your divine might.

You are near, Lord, and all your ways are truth.

Deceived is the deceiver,\
the once deceived redeemed now\
my God and by your Wisdom.

I have known your testimonies from of old, because you have founded them
for ever.

Behold the traitor cast down,\
to Hades’ depths abysmal,\
the deep pit of destruction.

See my humiliation and rescue me, because I have not forgotten your law.

Traps and pits and sharp snares-\
these are the ways of Judas,\
the madman and thrice-wretched.

Judge my cause and deliver me; for the sake of your law give me life.

All those who crucified you\
will be destroyed together,\
God’s Word and Son, the Great King.

Salvation is far from sinners, because they have not sought out your
statutes.

All the men of blood now\
will be destroyed together\
within destruction’s deep pit.

Your mercies, Lord, are many; according to judgement give me life.

Son of God, All-Sovereign,\
my God and my Creator,\
why did you will to suffer?

Those who pursue me and trouble me are many; I have not swerved from
your testimonies.

The heifer, when she saw him,\
her calf, hanged on the dread Tree,\
raised up a cry of great grief.

I have seen the senseless, and I burned, for they have not kept your
law.

See, noble Joseph buries\
the one life-bearing Body,\
and Nicodemus helps him.

See I have loved your commandments; O Lord, in your mercy give me life.

The weeping Maiden cried out,\
and from her eyes hot tears pour,\
as to the heart she is pierced.

The beginning of your words is truth; and all the judgements of your
justice are for ever.

‘O Light that gives my eyes light,\
my gentle Son, my sweet Child,\
why does the tomb now hide you?’

Rulers have persecuted me for no reason, and my heart has been in awe of
your words.

‘To free both Eve and Adam,\
Mother, this I suffer.\
Come, do not grieve and sorrow.’

I shall rejoice over your words, like one who has found much spoil.

‘The depth of your compassion,\
I glorify my dear Son,\
which makes you suffer these things.’

Injustice I hated and abhorred, but I loved your law.

They gave you gall to drink, Lord,\
and vinegar, Most Loving:\
the apple’s taste now passes.

Seven times a day I praised you for the judgements of your justice.

To a post they nailed you,\
who once your people sheltered\
below a cloudy pillar.

There is much peace for those who love your law, and there is no
stumbling for them.

Myrrh-bearing women, Saviour,\
approach your tomb to bring you\
the sweet myrrh to anoint you.\

I looked for your salvation, O Lord, and I loved your commandments.

Arise, O Lord of mercy,\
and from the depths of Hades\
now raise us all up with you.

My soul has kept your testimonies, because all your ways are before me,
O Lord.

Through her tears, your Mother,\
who gave you birth now cries out\
‘Arise, O Giver of life.’

I have kept your commandments and your testimonies; for all my ways are
before you, O Lord.

Make haste to rise again, Word,\
abolish now her grieving,\
the all pure Maid, who bore you.

Let my prayer enter your presence, O Lord; make me understand in
accordance with your word.

Heavens awesome powers\
stood amazed in terror,\
to see you lying lifeless.

Let my request come into your presence, O Lord; deliver me in accordance
with your word.

To those who love and fear you,\
and honour your dread Passion,\
now give release from all faults.

Let my lips burst into song, whenever you teach me your statutes.

A dread and most strange sight, this,\
O Word of God now tell us,\
how can earth cover you, Lord?

Let my tongue utter your words, because your commandments are justice.

One Joseph bore you, Saviour\
with him in flight, a second,\
to burial now bears you.

May your hand be there to save me, because I have chosen your
commandments.

Your all-pure Mother, Saviour,\
with tears and lamentation\
now mourns for you, who lie slain.

I have longed for your salvation, O Lord, and your law is my meditation.

All Heaven’s angels tremble\
Creator of the Cosmos,\
at your strange, dread entombment.

My soul will live and praise you, and your judgements will help me.

Myrrh-bearers came and sprinkled\
sweet myrrh upon your tomb, Lord,\
at early dawn they come now.\
\[**In Greek use sung three times, while the Priest sprinkles the Shroud
with sweet fragrances and flowers\]**

I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek your servant, because I have
not forgotten your commandments.

Peace unto your Church, Lord,\
salvation to your people,\
grant by your Resurrection.

Glory.

Father, Son and Spirit,\
O Trinity, my One God,\
have mercy on the whole world.

Both now.

Count all your servants worthy,\
to see, Most Holy Virgin,\
you Son’s bright Resurrection.

****

And again the first Troparion.

Each generation offers,\
my Christ, for your entombment\
in hymns and songs its praises.

****

And at once the Evlogitaria in Tone 5.

Before each Troparion we say:\

Blessed are you, O Lord: teach me your statutes.

The company of the Angels was amazed, seeing you numbered among the
dead, yet destroying the power of death, O Saviour, raising Adam with
yourself and freeing all from Hell.

‘Why do you mingle sweet spices with your tears, O women disciples?’ the
dazzling Angel in the tomb said to the women bearing myrrh, ‘Behold the
tomb, and understand: for the Saviour has risen from the grave’.

Early in the morning the women bearing myrrh hastened, lamenting, to
your grave; but the Angel stood before them and said, ‘The time for
lamentation has passed. Do not weep; but tell the Apostles of the
Resurrection’.

The women bearing spices coming to your grave, O Saviour, heard an Angel
saying to them, ‘Why do you number the living with the dead? For as God
he has risen from the grave’.

Glory.

**To the Trinity.**

We worship the Father, and his Son, and the Holy Spirit: the holy
consubstantial Trinity, as we cry with the Seraphim, ‘Holy, holy, holy
are you, O Lord!’

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

O Virgin, by giving birth you redeemed Adam from sin, and you brought
Eve joy instead of sorrow. He who was incarnate from you, who is both
God and man, has guided back to life those who had fallen from life.

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God (

**x3**) ****

And at once:

Again and again in peace, let us pray to the Lord. ****

Amen. ****

Then we sing the following Kathismata.\
Tone 1.

Joseph begged your revered Body of Pilate and anointing it with
sweet-smelling spices placed it in pure linen in a new grave. Wherefore
at dawn the myrrh-bearing women cried out, ‘Show us, O Christ, as you
foretold, your Resurrection’.

Glory.

The choirs of Angels were amazed as they saw how he, who is seated in
the bosom of the Father, is placed in a tomb as one dead, though he is
Immortal; whom the ranks of Angels, with the dead in Hell, surround and
glorify as Creator and Lord.

Lord, have mercy (

Psalm 50\

Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with your great mercy. According
to the multitude of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me
thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I
acknowledge my wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you
alone I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight, that you may be
justified in your words and win when you are judged. For see, in
wickedness I was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you
have loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your
wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You
will wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow. You will make me hear
of joy and gladness; the bones which have been humbled will rejoice.
Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities. Create
a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not
cast me out from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from
me. Give me back the joy of your salvation, and establish me with your
sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will
turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from
bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will
open my lips, and my mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had
wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it. You will not take pleasure in
burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a broken and a
humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good
pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be
well pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt
offerings. Then they will offer calves upon your altar. ****

And we begin the Canon, of which the Acrostic is:

And today I sing a great Sabbath.

****

We sing the Irmi twice and the Troparia to make 14. Then the Irmos again
as Katavasia.

Ode 1. Tone 6. Irmos.

‘The One, who of old hid the pursuing tyrant in the waves of the sea,
the children of those he saved have hidden beneath the earth; but let
us, like the young maidens, sing to the Lord; for he has been greatly
glorified.’

****

Verse:

Glory to you, O God, glory to you. **And so before each Troparion.**

Troparia

Lord, my God, I will sing a song for your departure, a funeral hymn for
you who by your burial opened up for me the entrances to life, and by
your death put Death and Hell to death.

All things above the world and all below the earth quaked with fear at
your death, as they saw you on the throne above and below in a tomb; for
beyond understanding you appeared as a one dead, you the source of life.

That you might fill all things with your glory, you went down into the
lowest parts of the earth; for my substance, which is in Adam was not
hidden from you, and by being buried you make me, who had been
corrupted, new, O Lover of humankind.

****

Katavasia

The One, who of old hid the pursuing tyrant in the waves of the sea, the
children of those he saved have hidden beneath the earth; but let us,
like the young maidens, sing to the Lord; for he has been greatly
glorified.

****

Ode 3. Irmos.

‘When it saw you, who had hung the whole earth freely on the waters,
hanging on Golgotha, creation was seized with great amazement and cried,
‘None is holy but you, O Lord’.’

****

Troparia

Multiplying visions, you revealed symbols of your burial, while now, as
God and man, you have also made clear your secrets, Master, to those in
Hell, who cry, ‘None is holy but you, O Lord’.

You opened out your palms and united things that before were separated,
while by being closed in a shroud and a grave, O Saviour, you loosed
those who were fettered. None is holy but you, O Lord.

By your will, O uncontainable, you were held fast by grave and seals;
and by your energies you made known your power as God to those who sing,
‘None is holy but you, O Lord, lover of humankind’.

****

Katavasia

When it saw you, who had hung the whole earth freely on the waters,

Then we sing the following Kathismata.\
Tone 1. Model Melody.

The soldiers watching your tomb became as dead men at the lightning
flash of the Angel who appeared and proclaimed the Resurrection to the
women. We glorify you, who destroy corruption; we fall down before you,
who rose from the tomb and alone are our God.

Glory. Both now.

Ode 4. Irmos

‘Foreseeing your divine self-emptying on the Cross, Avvakoum, amazed,
cried out, ‘You cut off the might of the powerful, O Good One, you
speaking with those in Hell as all-powerful’.’

****

Troparia

You sanctified the seventh day, which of old you blessed by resting from
your works; for you bring all things into being and make them new, as
you keep the Sabbath rest, O Saviour, and restore your strength.

By your greater strength you gained the victory; your soul was parted
from your body, shattering the bonds of both Death and Hell, O Word, by
your might.

Hell, when it met you, O Word, was embittered, seeing a mortal made
divine, marked by wounds and all powerful, and it shrank back in terror
at the sight.

****

Katavasia

Foreseeing your divine self-emptying on the Cross, Avvakoum, amazed,
cried out, ‘You cut off the might of the powerful, O Good One, you
speaking with those in Hell as all-powerful’.

Ode 5. Irmos

‘Isaias, as he watched by night, O Christ, saw the light which knows no
evening of your theophany, which in your compassion came to pass for us,
and he cried, ‘The dead will arise and those in the graves will rise,
and those in the earth will rejoice.’

****

Troparia

Becoming a creature formed of dust, our Fashioner, you make new those
born of earth, and the shroud and the tomb point to the mystery within
you, O Word; for the noble counsellor fulfils the counsel of your
Begetter, who in you gloriously makes me new.

Through death you transform mortality, through burial corruption; for in
a manner fitting God you make incorruptible the nature you took on and
make it immortal. For your flesh did not know corruption, Master, nor
was your soul, like a stranger, abandoned in Hell.

You came forth from a birth without travail and, pierced in your side,
my Fashioner, you wrought the refashioning of Eve by becoming Adam,
sleeping supernaturally a life-producing sleep and raising life from
sleep and corruption, as all-powerful.

****

Katavasia

Isaias, as he watched by night, O Christ, saw the light which knows no
evening of your theophany, which in your compassion came to pass for us,
and he cried, ‘The dead will arise and those in the graves will rise,
and those in the earth will rejoice.’

****

Ode 6. Irmos

‘Jonas was held, but not held fast in the belly of the whale; for being
a type of you, the One who suffered and was given over to burial, as
from a bridal chamber he leapt forth from the beast and cried to the
guard, ‘You who vainly and falsely keep guard, you have forsaken your
own mercy’.’

****

Troparia

You were torn, but not torn away, O Word, from the flesh you had taken.
For though your temple was destroyed at the moment of the passion, you
were still one person in your Godhead and your flesh; for in both you
are one Son, Word of God, God and man.

Adam’s fall slew mortals but not God, for though your substance of dust
suffered, yet your Godhead remained impassible. That which was
corruptible in you, you have transformed to incorruption, and you have
revealed a source of incorruptible life from your resurrection.

Hell reigns, but not for ever, over the race of mortals; for you, O
Mighty One, when placed in a tomb, shattered with your palm, the origin
of life, the bars of death, and proclaimed to those who slept there from
every age no false redemption, O Saviour, who have become the first-born
of the dead.

****

Katavasia

Jonas was held, but not held fast in the belly of the whale; for being a
type of you, the One who suffered and was given over to burial, as from
a bridal chamber he leapt forth from the beast and cried to the guard,

After the small litany the Kontakion. Tone 6.\

\[**By Romanos the Melodist.**\]

He who closed the abyss lies dead before our eyes; and wrapped in myrrh
and fine linen the Immortal is laid as a mortal in a grave. While women
came to anoint him, weeping bitterly and crying out, ‘This is the most
blessed Sabbath, on which Christ sleeps, but he will rise again on the
third day’.

****

Ikos

He who holds all things together was lifted up on the Cross, and all
creation lamented seeing him hanging naked on the tree; the sun hid its
rays, and the stars threw away their light; the earth quaked with great
fear, the sea fled and the rocks were rent; many graves were opened, and
bodies of holy men were raised. Hell below is groaning and the Jews are
considering how to discredit Christ’s resurrection; the women are crying
out, ‘This is the most blessed Sabbath, on which Christ sleeps, but he
will rise again on the third day’.

****

Menologion, and the following notice from the Triodion:

\
On the holy and great Sabbath we celebrate the burial of our Lord and
God and Saviour, Jesus Christ and the Descent into Hell, through which
our race, called back from corruption, has passed over to eternal life.

Verses\

In vain, O guard, you keep watch on the tomb,\
No sepulchre can hold in life itself.

By your ineffable condescension, Christ, our God, have mercy on us.
Amen.

Ode 7. Irmos

‘Ineffable wonder! He who in the furnace delivered the holy youths from
the flame, is laid in the tomb a lifeless corpse for the salvation of us
who sing, ‘God, our Redeemer, blessed are you!’’

****

Troparia

Hell has been wounded, having received in its heart the One whose side
was pierced by a lance, and consumed by divine fire groans aloud at the
salvation of us who sing, ‘God, our Redeemer, blessed are you!’

O happy tomb! For having received in itself the Creator as one asleep,
it has been revealed as a treasure house of life for the salvation of us
who sing, ‘God, our Redeemer, blessed are you!’

The life of all things accepts being laid in the tomb, according to the
law of those who die, and he shows it to be a source of rising for the
salvation of us who sing, ‘God, our Redeemer, blessed are you!’

In Hell and in the tomb and in Eden Christ’s godhead was one and
inseparable with the Father and the Spirit for the salvation of us who
sing, ‘God, our Redeemer, blessed are you!’

****

Katavasia

Ineffable wonder! He who in the furnace delivered the holy youths from
the flame, is laid in the tomb a lifeless corpse for the salvation of us
who sing, ‘God, our Redeemer, blessed are you!’

****

Ode 8. Irmos

‘Be amazed and tremble, O heaven, and be shaken, foundations of the
earth; for see he who dwells in the highest is numbered among the dead,
and welcomed in a little tomb. Youths bless him, priests praise him,
people highly exalt him to all the ages.’

****

Troparia

The immaculate temple has been destroyed, but raises up the fallen
tabernacle; for the second Adam, who dwells in the highest, has come
down to the first as far as the storehouses of Hell; Youths bless him,
priests praise him, people highly exalt him to all the ages.

The daring of the disciples has failed, but Joseph of Arimatheia has
proved valiant; for seeing the God over all dead and naked he asked for
him and gave him burial, crying, ‘Youths bless him, priests praise him,
people highly exalt him to all the ages’.

****

Katavasia

Be amazed and tremble, O heaven, and be shaken, foundations of the
earth; for see he who dwells in the highest is numbered among the dead,
and welcomed in a little tomb. Youths bless him, priests praise him,
people highly exalt him to all the ages.

The Magnificat is not sung, but instead the 9th Ode.

Ode 9. Irmos

‘Do not weep for me, Mother, as you see in a tomb the Son whom you
conceived in your womb without seed; for I shall arise and be glorified,
and I shall exalt in glory without ceasing those who with faith and love
magnify you.’

****

Troparia

‘At your strange birth, my Son without beginning, beyond nature I
escaped the pangs and was made blessed; but now, my God, as I see you
dead, I am pierced terribly by the sword of sorrow; but arise, that I
may be magnified.’

‘Earth covers me by my own will, but the gatekeepers of Hell shudder as
they see me clothed in the blood-stained robe of vengeance, Mother; for
having trampled on my enemies by the Cross, I shall arise again and
magnify you.’

‘Let creation rejoice, let all born of earth be glad; for Hell, the
enemy, has been despoiled; let women come to meet me with sweet spices;
for I am rescuing Adam and Eve with all their race, and on the third day
I shall rise again.’

Today a tomb hold him who holds all creation in his palm. A stone covers
him who covered the heavens with glory. Life sleeps and Hell trembles
and Adam is being released from his bonds. Glory to your dispensation,
through which you have accomplished all things and granted us an eternal
Sabbath rest, your resurrection from the dead!

\[

**B**\] Praise him in the blast of the trumpet: praise him upon the lute
and harp.

What is this sight that is seen? What is this present rest? The king of

his Sabbath rest in a tomb, granting us a new Sabbath rest. To him let
us cry, ‘Arise, O God, judge the earth, for you are king for ever, and
without measure is your great mercy.

\[

**A**\] Praise him with the timbrel and dances: praise him upon the
strings and pipe.

Come, let us see our life lying in a tomb, that he may give life to all
those who lie in the tombs. Come today, as we contemplate the Sleeping
one from Juda, let us prophetically cry out to him, ‘Taking your rest,
you lay down like a lion. Who will rouse you, O King? But arise by your
own will, who gave yourself willingly for us. Lord, glory to you!

gladness. Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.

Joseph asked for the body of Jesus, and laid it in his new grave; for it

chamber. You smashed the might of death and opened the gates of Paradise
for humankind; glory to you!

**A**\] **** Glory. **Tone 6**

Great Moses mystically prefigured this present day when he said, ‘And
God blessed the seventh day’. For this is the blessed Sabbath, this the
day of rest on which the only-begotten Son of God rested from all his
works. Through the dispensation in accordance with death, he kept the
Sabbath in the flesh, and, returning once again to what he was, through
the Resurrection he has granted us eternal life, for he alone is good
and loves humankind.

It is customary for there to be a procession with the Epitaphion at the
end of the Great Doxology, though the Triodion of the Apostoliki
Diakonia says nothing. It is also customary to sing the following
idiomel by George of the Holy City in Tone 5:

When Joseph saw that the sun had hidden its rays and the veil of the
temple had been rent in two at the death of the Saviour, he approached
Pilate and entreated him, saying, ‘Give me this stranger, who since
infancy has been a stranger in the world. Give me this stranger, whom
members of his own race hated and slew as a stranger. Give me this
stranger, whom I welcome as a stranger as I see the strangeness of his
death. Give me this stranger, who knew how to welcome as strangers the
poor and those who were strangers. Give me this stranger, whom Hebrews
out of envy have made a stranger to the world. Give me this stranger,
that I may hide in a tomb one who as a stranger has no place to lay his
head. Give me this stranger, whose his mother when she saw him slain
cried out, ‘O my Son and my God, though I am wounded to the core and
torn to the heart as I see you dead, yet confident in your resurrection,
I magnify you’.’ When he had with words like this entreated Pilate, the
noble Joseph takes the Saviour’s body, and having in fear wrapped it in
a winding sheet with myrrh, he placed in a tomb the One who grants the
world eternal life and his great mercy.

****

When the procession has re-entered the church and the Epitaphion has
been carried into the sanctuary, the Priest exclaims:

Let us attend. Peace to all.

**Reader:** And to your spirit.

**Priest: Wisdom.**

****

Then the three Apolytikia of the day are sung. Tone 2.

When you went down to death, O immortal life, then you slew Hell with
the lightning flash of your Godhead; but when from the depths below the
earth you raised the dead, all the Powers beyond the heavens cried out:
Giver of life, Christ our God, glory to you!

The Angel standing by the grave cried to the women bearing myrrh: Myrrh
is fitting for the dead, but Christ has shown himself a stranger to
corruption.

The noble Joseph, taking down your most pure Body from the Tree, wrapped
it in a clean shroud with sweet spices and laid it for burial in a new
grave.

Christ, who hold fast the ends of the earth, you accepted to be held
fast in a tomb, that you might ransom humanity from the maw of Hell, \*

Glory.

And as immortal God you have given us life and immortality.

Both now.

Verse: **

O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us.

The Reading from the Prophecy of Ezekiel.

\[

**37:-14**\]

The hand of the Lord was upon me and the Lord brought me out in Spirit
and set me in the middle of the plain, and it was full of human bones.
And he led me round them in a circle and lo, there were very many bones
on the surface of the plain, and lo, they were very dry. And he said to
me: Son of man, will these bones live? And I said: Lord, Lord, you know
this. And he said to me: Prophesy to these bones and you will say to
them: Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord to these
bones: See, I am bringing a spirit of life upon you, and I will give you
sinews and I will bring flesh upon you, and I will stretch skin on you
and put my spirit into you, and you shall live; and you shall know that
I am the Lord. And I prophesied as he had commanded me. And it came to
pass as I prophesied there was a shaking, and the bones approached one
another, each to its joint. And I saw, and lo, sinews and flesh were
growing on them, and skin came up upon them , but there was no spirit in
them. And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, son of man, prophesy
and say to the spirit: Thus says the Lord: Come from the four winds and
breathe on these dead bodies and make them live. And I prophesied as he
had commanded me, and the spirit entered them, and they lived, and they
stood upon their feet, a very great gathering. And the Lord spoke to me
saying: Son of man, these bones are all the house of Israel, and they
say: Our bones have become dry, our hope has perished, we are quite
lost. And so prophesy and say to them: Thus says the Lord, the Lord:
See, I am opening your graves, and I shall bring you out of your graves
and shall bring you into the land of Israel, and you shall know that I
am the Lord, when I open your tombs for me to bring my people out of the
tombs; and I shall put my spirit into you, and you will live, and I
shall set you on your land and you will know that I am the Lord; I have
spoken and I shall do it, says the Lord.

Arise, O Lord my God, let your hand be lifted up; forget not your poor
for ever.

Verse:

I will confess you, Lord, with my whole heart; I will tell of all your
marvellous works.

The Reading from the 1st Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians.

\[

**5:6-8, Gal. 3:13-14**\]

Brethren, a little leaven leavens the whole batch. Clean out the old
leaven, that you may be a new batch, as you are unleavened. For Christ
our Passover has been sacrificed. Therefore let us keep the feast, not
with the old leaven, not with the leaven of wickedness and evil, but
with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. For Christ has
redeemed us from the curse of the law, by becoming a curse for us. For
it is written: Accursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree; that in
Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations, that we
might receive the promise of the Spirit through the faith.

Verse:

So shall sinners perish before the face of God.

The Reading is from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\
\[**27:62-66\]**

On the next day, which is after the Preparation, the chief priests and
Pharisees came together to Pilate and said, ‘Sir, we remember that that
deceiver said while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will arise.’
Give orders then for the tomb to be made secure until the third day,
otherwise his disciples may come at night and steal him and tell the
people that he has been raised from the dead. And the last deception
will be worse than the first.’ Pilate said, ‘You have a watch. God, make
it as secure as you can.’ So they went with the watch and made the tomb
secure by sealing the stone.
