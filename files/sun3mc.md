AT MATINS
=========

**After the 1st reading of the Psalter, Kathismata of the Resurrection. Tone 3.**

Christ has risen from the dead, the first fruits of those that sleep. The First-born of creation and Creator of all that has come to be, has renewed in himself the corrupted nature of our race. Death, you are no longer lord, for the Master of all things has destroyed your might.

****

Verse:

Arise, Lord my God, lift up your hand. Do not forget your poor for ever.

Having tasted death in the flesh, Lord, you have cut out the bitterness of death by your Rising and given humankind strength against it, announcing the abolition of the ancient curse. Defender of our life, Lord, glory to you!

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. Model melody. Awed by the beauty**

Awed by the beauty of your virginity and by the splendour of your purity, Gabriel cried aloud to you, O Mother of God, ‘How can I praise you as I should? With what name shall I invoke you? I am troubled and amazed; therefore as I was commanded I cry to you: Hail, full of grace!’

****

After the 2nd reading of the Psalter, other Kathismata. Awed by the beauty.

Awed by your unchanging Godhead and your voluntary passion, Lord, Hell mourned, ‘I tremble at your body’s substance, which is not corrupted. I see you, the invisible, mystically making war on me; and so those whom I hold cry out, Glory, O Christ, to your Resurrection!’

****

Verse:

I will praise you, Lord, with my whole heart. I will tell of all your marvellous works.

We faithful contemplate an ineffable mystery: your Crucifixion that cannot be understood and your Rising that cannot be explained. For today Death and Hell have been despoiled, but the human race has put on incorruption. And so with thanksgiving we cry, ‘Glory, O Christ, to your Resurrection!’

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Mystically you contained in your womb the Incomprehensible and the Uncircumscribable, consubstantial with the Father and the Spirit; and we acknowledge that in your Offspring one unconfused energy of the Trinity is glorified in the world. And so with thanksgiving we cry to you, ‘Hail, full of grace!’

****

After Psalm 118, the Ypakoï.

Causing amazement by his appearing, and refreshment by his words the dazzling Angel said the myrrh-bearing women, ‘Why do you seek the living in a grave? He has risen, emptying the graves. Know that the unchanging has changed corruption. Say to God: How fearful are your works! For you have saved the human race.’

****

The Anavathmi. Antiphon 1. \[Psalm 125\]

You delivered the captivity of Zion from Babylon, O Word. Draw me too from the passions to life.

Those who sow in the South with tears inspired by God, will reap in joy sheaves that endure for ever.

Glory. Both now.

By the Holy Spirit comes the giving of all good things, as he shines with the Father and the Son. In him all things live and move.

****

Antiphon 2. \[Psalm 126\]

Unless the Lord build the house of the virtues, we labour in vain. While he protects the soul no one lays waste our city.

By the Spirit of the fruit of the womb, the Saints are always as sons to you, O Christ, as to the Father.

Glory. Both now.

In the Holy Spirit is seen all holiness and wisdom; for he gives existence to every creature. Let us worship him as the Father and the Son, for he is God.

****

Antiphon 3. \[Psalm 127\]

Those who fear the Lord are blessed as they walk his paths; for they eat the living fruit of the commandments.

Be glad, Chief Shepherd, as you see around your table your offspring bearing branches of good works.

Glory. Both now.

In the Holy Spirit is all the wealth of glory; from him comes grace and life for all creation; for he is praised with the Father and the Word.

****

Prokeimenon. \[Psalm 95\]

Tell it among the nations; the Lord is King. \* For he has established the whole world, which shall not be shaken.

****

Verse:

Sing to the Lord a new song. Sing to the Lord all the earth.

Let everything that has breath,

**the Dawn Gospel***,* Having seen the Resurrection **and the rest***.* ****

Canon of the Resurrection. Ode 1. Tone 3. Irmos.

He who of old assembled the waters into one gathering by his divine decree, and divided the sea for the people of Israel. He is our God and he is glorified. To him alone let us sing, for he has been glorified.

****

Troparia.

He who condemned the earth to bear thorns of sweat for the transgressor, accepted in the body a crown of thorns from a lawless hand. He is our God who abolished the curse, for he has been glorified.

Triumphant victor he is over death — Death was exposed as full of fear — for, having take living flesh subject to suffering, our God wrestled with the tyrant and raised all with himself, for he has been glorified.

****

Theotokion.

All the nations glorify you as true Mother of God, who gave birth without seed; for, having come into your hallowed womb, our God, took that which was according to our nature, and as both God and man he was born from you.

****

Another Canon of the Cross and Resurrection, whose acrostic, with the Irmi, is:

I sing you a third song, Word of God. ****

Irmos. Peoples, let us sing.

By his divine blood, Christ has redeemed the race of mortals, enslaved to the sin-loving tyrant, and making it divine he has renewed it, for he has been glorified.

Christ, the guardian of life, as a mortal willingly tasted death; while being by nature immortal he gave life to the dead, for he has been glorified.

****

Another Canon, to the Mother of God, whose acrostic, with the Irmi is:

I sing you a third song, Mother of God. ****

Irmos. Peoples, let us sing.

Every nature of heavenly beings fittingly bends the knee, O Virgin, to him who was incarnate from you, and with them those below the earth together with those on earth, for he has been glorified.

O the transactions which took place in you! For as God who bestows good things unstintingly, giving us the divine Spirit, he accepted flesh from you, O Maiden, for he has been glorified.

****

Ode 3. Irmos.

Almighty and Most High, who out of nothing bring all things, created by the Word, perfected by the Spirit, establish me in your love.

****

Troparia.

Through your Cross the impious has been shamed, for he has fallen into the pit which he dug out; while the horn of the humble, O Christ, has been exalted in your Resurrection.

The preaching of true religion has covered like water the seas of the nations, Lover of mankind; for by rising from the tomb you have uncovered the light of the Trinity.

****

Theotokion.

Glorious things are spoken of you, living city of him who is king for ever; for through you, Sovereign Lady, God lived among those on earth.

****

Another, of the Cross and Resurrection. You smashed the bow of enemies.

Immaculate Cross, you were revealed to be cleansing from the offscourings of idols, for Jesus, supremely divine, stretched out his hands upon you.

That all we the faithful may worship you, the grave which received life, Christ who is truly our God has been buried in you and has been raised.

****

Of the Mother of God. The same Irmos.

A rod from Jesse’s root has budded, as the Prophet said, the Virgin who blossomed with a flower for us: you, O Christ. Holy are you, O Lord.

That you might make those born of earth partakers in the divine nature, you took our flesh from the Virgin, and became poor. Holy are you, O Lord.

****

Ode 4. Irmos.

You displayed mighty love for us, O Lord; for you gave your Only-begotten Son to death for our sake. Therefore with thanksgiving we cry to you, ‘Glory to your power, O Lord!’

****

Troparia.

In your compassion, O Christ, you bore marks and stripes, bravely enduring the insult of blows and with long-suffering accepting spitting. Through these you wrought salvation for me. Glory to your power, O Lord!

In a mortal body, O Life, you were acquainted with death, for the sake of the wretchedness of your poor and the groans of your needy ones, and having destroyed the destroyer and been glorified you raised all with you, only Lover of mankind.

****

Theotokion.

Remember, O Christ, the flock which you have gained by your Passion. Accepting the compassionate entreaties of your glorious Mother and watching over it in its affliction, deliver it by your power, O Lord.

****

Another, of the Cross and Resurrection. The strange and ineffable mystery.

O Lover of mankind, who fashioned mankind according to your image, and when it was slain by sin through transgression, you saved it by being crucified on Calvary.

Death gave up the dead whom it had swallowed, while Hell’s palace, which brings corruption, was destroyed when you rose from the tomb, O Lord.

****

Of the Mother of God. Same Irmos.

O Master, who established the mountains with the yoke of divine knowledge, without hands you were hewn as a stone from the Virgin. To your power be glory, O Lover of mankind.

You healed our diseased nature, Master, by uniting with it in the Virgin this most potent medicine: your immaculate Godhead, O Word.

O Lord, you are my portion and my lot so long-desired; from the Virgin you united me, O Word, with your person, having been declared a person in the flesh.

****

Ode 5. Irmos.

I rise to you at dawn, Creator of all, Peace which passes all understanding; for your commandments are light. O guide me by them.

****

Troparia.

Handed over by the envy of the Hebrews to an unjust judge, you, the All-seeing, who judge the whole earth with justice, delivered Adam from the ancient condemnation.

O Christ, who rose from the dead, grant peace to your Churches by the invincible power of your Cross and save our souls.

****

Theotokion.

Holy Tabernacle, and wider then the Heavens, for you received the Word of God, whom all creation cannot contain, you alone have been revealed as ever virgin.

****

Another, of the Cross and Resurrection. The invisible was seen on earth.

O Christ, when your side was pierced by the lance, you freed from the curse her who was created from a human side and became the agent of destruction for all mortals.

Christ, our Saviour, equal in being with the Father, you raised from the dead the sacred temple of your all-pure and all-honoured body.

****

Of the Mother of God. The same Irmos.

The Word of God, O Virgin, your Son, the Creator of Adam the first-formed, is no creature, though he fashioned for himself a living flesh from you.

Equal to the Father, the Son of the Virgin, the Word of God, is a perfect Person in two natures, Jesus the Lord, perfect God and man.

****

Ode 6. Irmos.

The final abyss of sins has surrounded me and my spirit fails; but, Master, stretch out your upraised arm and like Peter save me, O my Pilot.

****

Troparia.

An abyss of mercy and pity has surrounded me by your compassionate descent; for becoming incarnate and being in the form of a servant, Master, you have made me divine and glorified me together with yourself.

The death-dealer underwent death when he saw the one who had been put to death restored to life. These are the tokens of your Resurrection, O Christ, and the rewards of your immaculate Passion.

****

Theotokion.

O All-pure, the only mediatrix beyond understanding between the Fashioner and humankind, beseech your merciful Son on behalf of your stumbling servants and be our champion.

****

Another, of the Cross and Resurrection. Jonas became a symbol.

Tried by stripes, by the Passion of the Cross you raised with you those who lay slain in Hell; therefore I cry to you, ‘Bring my life up from corruption, O Lover of mankind.’

Hell’s gates open to you in fear, O Christ, the enemy’s possessions are seized. Therefore the Women met you and received joy instead of sorrow.

****

Of the Mother of God. The same Irmos.

He who has no part in any shape, takes our form from the undefiled Maiden, becoming man in shape and deed, unchanged in his divinity.

From an abyss of sins and from the tempest of the passions deliver me, O Pure one, for you have become a harbour and abyss of wonders for those who have recourse to you in faith.

****

Kontakion. Today the Virgin.

You arose today, O Merciful One, and led us out from the gates of death. Adam dances today, and Eve rejoices. Prophets too, along with Patriarchs, praise without ceasing **the divine might of your authority**.

****

The Ikos.

Let heaven and earth dance today, and in harmony sing the praise of Christ our God, for he raised the prisoners from the tombs. All creation rejoices together as it offers fitting songs to the Creator of all things and our Redeemer. For today, as Giver of life, he drew mortals out of Hell and raises them together to heaven. He lays low the uprisings of the foe and smashes the gates of hell by **the divine might of his authority**.

****

Ode 7. Irmos.

As of old you refreshed with dew the three godly Youths in the Chaldean flame, so shine with the enlightening fire of your Godhead upon us who cry, ‘Blessed are you, the God of our fathers!’"

****

Troparia.

The shining veil of the Temple was rent by the Cross of the Creator, revealing the truth hidden in the letter to the faithful who cry, ‘Blessed are you, the God of our fathers!’

When your side was pierced, O Christ, drops of your life-bearing blood, flowing from God by divine dispensation, fell upon the earth and refashioned those who cry, ‘Blessed are you, the God of our fathers!’

****

Of the Trinity.

Let us believers glorify the good Spirit with the Father and the only-begotten Son, as we honour one Principle and one Godhead in three Persons as we cry, ‘Blessed are you, the God of our fathers!’

****

Another of the Cross and Resurrection. Haughty was the tyrant.

The sun is not being darkened for a mere man hanging on a Cross, but at seeing God incarnate, to whom we also sing, ‘Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers!’

The coward Hell, quailing before him who is strong by his Godhead and who grants incorruption, spewed out the souls of the Just, who cried out, ‘Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers!’

All-pure, you are a priceless treasure of blessing for those who confess with a pure heart that you are Mother of God; for from you was incarnate the God of our fathers.

****

Of the Mother of God. The same Irmos.

Lord of glory and ruler of the powers on high, who are seated with the Father and borne in the arms of a Virgin, ‘Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers.’

Death is bold, but when it joined battle with you, God in person made flesh of the Virgin, you destroyed it. Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers.

We all acknowledge you as Mother of God who bore God in your womb; for you gave birth to one of the Trinity made flesh. Blessed, All-pure, is the fruit of your womb.

****

Ode 8. The Irmos.

In the unbearable fire, but unharmed by the flames, the Young Men, famed for their reverence for God, became as one as they sang the divine hymn, ‘All you works of the Lord bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.’

The radiance of the Temple was shattered when your Cross was fixed on Calvary, and all creation was shaken as it sang in fear, ‘All you works of the Lord bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.’

You rose from the tomb, O Christ, and by your divine power set upright the one who had fallen by deceit through a tree as he cried and said, ‘All you works of the Lord bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.’

****

Theotokion.

You have been declared Temple of God, spiritual place and Ark; for you reconciled the Creator to mortals, most pure Mother of God, and fittingly all we his works praise you and highly exalt you to all the ages.

****

Another of the Cross and Resurrection. A flame of material fire.

The Word was not subject to suffering, for by his Godhead he cannot suffer; but God suffered in the flesh, to whom also we sing, ‘All you works of the Lord bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.’

Having slept as a mortal, you were raised up as immortal, O Saviour, and you save from death those who sing, ‘All you works of the Lord bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.’

****

Of the Trinity.

Devoutly we worship the Godhead united in three Persons and we sing without ceasing, ‘All you works of the Lord bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.’

****

Of the Mother of God. The same Irmos.

Blessed Virgin Mother, who have been raised above the spiritual powers and set next to God, we bless your Offspring and highly exalt him to all the ages.

You revealed your natural beauty to be most fair when you blazed forth the flesh of the Godhead. Blessed Virgin, we bless your Offspring and highly exalt him to all the ages.

****

Ode 9. The Irmos.

New the wonder and fitting God: for the Lord clearly passes through the closed gate of the Virgin: naked at his going in and God bearing flesh at his coming out, while the gate remains closed. As ineffably Mother of God we magnify her.

****

Troparia.

Fearful it is, O Word of God, to see you the Maker destroyed on a Tree, suffering in the flesh, God on behalf of slaves, and lying lifeless in a grave, but releasing the dead from Hell. Therefore, O Christ, as all-powerful we magnify you.

By being placed as a corpse in a tomb, O Christ, you saved the Forefathers from the corruption of death, and you made life blossom by rising from the dead, leading mortal nature to the light and clothing it with divine incorruption. Therefore as source of ever-living light we magnify you.

****

Theotokion.

You were revealed, All-pure, as Temple and throne of God, in which he who lives in the highest took his dwelling, born without man, and in no way opening the gates of your flesh. Therefore by your unceasing prayers, O Holy One, finally defeat the tribes of barbarians and subject them to our King.

****

Another. Of the Cross and Resurrection. We who are wounded by the sweet dart.

You have became a source of glory for mortals by a dishonourable death, which you tasted, Christ Saviour, through crucifixion in your mortal nature, and you granted me incorruption, for you love mankind.

By rising from the tomb, O Christ, you saved me and exalted me and brought me to the Father, your Begetter, and you took your seat at his right hand through the compassion of your mercy, O Lord.

****

Of the Mother of God. The same Irmos.

For the devout faithful, O Virgin, there is no surfeit of your praises at all; for receiving divine and spiritual love, as Mother of God with love they magnify you.

You have placed the one who bore you, O Christ, as an intercessor for us, who can never be put to shame. At her entreaties, O Merciful, you distribute to us the Spirit who gives freely of his goodness, who proceeds through you from the Father.

****

At Lauds. Stichera of the Resurrection.

Tone 3.

Come all you nations, acknowledge the power of the dread mystery; for Christ our Saviour, the Word in the beginning, was crucified for us and willingly buried and rose from the dead to save the whole universe. Let us worship him.

Your guards recounted all the marvels, Lord, but, by filling their right hand with gifts, the Sanhedrin of folly thought to conceal your Resurrection, which the world glorifies. Have mercy on us.

All things have been filled with joy on receiving proof of the Resurrection. For Mary Magdalen came to the grave, found an Angel seated on the stone and dazzling in shining raiment, who said, ‘Why do you seek the living with the dead? He is not here, but he has risen, as he said, and goes before you into Galilee.’

In your light, O Master who love mankind, we shall see light. For you rose from the dead, granting salvation to the human race, that all creation may glorify you, the only sinless one. Have mercy on us.

****

Other Stichera by Anatolios.

As a morning hymn, Lord, the Myrrhbearing Women offered you their tears. For bringing perfumes of sweet fragrance, they came to your grave, eager to anoint your most pure Body. An angel seated on the stone gave them the good tidings, ‘Why do you seek the living with the dead? For he has trampled on death and has risen as God, granting to all his great mercy.’

A dazzling Angel by your life-giving grave said to the Myrrh-bearers, ‘The Redeemer has emptied the tombs, he has despoiled Hell and risen on the third day as alone God and all-powerful.’

On the first day of the week Mary Magdalen came to the grave and sought you. When she did not find you, she lamented and cried out with grief, ‘Alas, my Saviour, how have you, the King of all, been stolen?’ But a pair of life-bearing Angels from within the grave cried out, ‘Why do you weep, woman?’ ‘I weep’, she said, ‘because they have taken my Lord from the tomb and I do not know where they have laid him’. But when, turning back, she saw you, at once she cried out, ‘My Lord and my God, glory to you!’

The Hebrews shut Life up in the tomb; but the Thief opened the Paradise of pleasure with his voice when he cried and said, ‘The One who was crucified with me and who was hanged with me upon the tree also appears to me seated on the throne together with the Father. For he is Christ our God, who has great mercy.

Glory,

**the Sunday Eothinon.** Both now, You are most blessed. **Then the Great Doxology and after it the Troparion***,* Today salvation has come to the world.
