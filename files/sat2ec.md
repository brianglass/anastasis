PERIOD OF TONE 2
================

**ON SATURDAY EVENING**

AT SMALL VESPERS
----------------

**At** Lord, I have cried… **we insert 4 Stichera, and sing the 3 Resurrection Stichera from the Oktoichos, doubling the 1st.** Glory…, Both now… **and the following Theotokion, the Dogmatic.**

Tone 2.

O the great mystery! As I contemplate the wonders I proclaim the Godhead, I do not deny the humanity. For Emmanuel opened the gates of nature as he loves mankind, yet did not break open the locks of virginity, but came forth from the womb as he had entered through hearing. He became incarnate as he had been conceived. Impassibly he entered, ineffably he came forth, in accordance with the saying of the Prophet, ‘This gate will remain shut; none may enter through it, but only the Lord God of Israel, he who has great mercy’.

****

Then

O Joyful Light… **and the Prokeimenon** The Lord is King… **with its verses. After** Grant, Lord… **etc., we sing the first Resurrection Sticheron of the Aposticha and the following Prosomia of the Mother of God.**

Verse:

** I shall remember your name in every generation and generation.

Of all who are afflicted the joy, protector of the wronged, sustenance of those in need, staff of the blind, visitation of the sick, shelter and assistance of the oppressed, helper of orphans and Mother of God Most High are you, O All-pure. Hasten, we beseech you, to deliver your servants.

****

Verse:

Listen, daughter, and see, and incline your ear; and forget your people and your father’s house.

Every iniquity without restraint, every sin without limit, wretch that I am, I have committed; of every condemnation I have become worthy. Grant me, O Virgin, means of repentance, that I may appear there uncondemned. For I appoint you as my intercessor, I call you in as my protector. Do not put me to shame, O Bride of God.

****

Verse:

The rich among the people of the land will entreat your favour.

We have no other refuge to the Maker and Master but you, Pure Bride of God. With your fervent protection do not cast us away; do not put us to shame who with love hasten under your shelter.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Who will praise, who will call you blessed as is fitting, Maiden Bride of God, for the redemption which through you has come to the world? Therefore with thanksgiving we cry to you and say, ‘Hail, who made Adam divine and brought together what was separated. Hail, who enlightened our race by the light-bearing Resurrection of your Son and our God; for we, the race of Christians, unceasingly magnify you.

Now Master…,

**Trisagion etc. and the Resurrection Apolytikion.**

And the Dismissal.

AT GREAT VESPERS

****

After the Opening Psalm and the first Kathisma of the Psalter, at

Lord I have cried**, we insert 10 Stichera, and we sing 7 Resurrection Stichera and 3 of the Saint of the day, or as the Typikon directs.**

Resurrection Stichera. Tone 2.

Come let us worship God the Word, begotten of the Father before the ages, incarnate of the Virgin Mary; for having endured the Cross, he was handed over for burial, as he himself wished, and having risen from the dead he saved me, mankind that had gone astray.

Christ our Saviour by nailing the record against us to the Cross annulled it, and destroyed the might of death. We worship his Rising on the third day.

With Archangels let us sing the praise of the Resurrection of Christ; for he is the Redeemer and the Saviour of our souls; and with dread glory and mighty power he is coming again to judge the world which he fashioned.

****

Other Verses, by Anatolios.

An Angel proclaimed you, the crucified and buried Master, and said to the women; ‘Come, see where the Lord was lying. For he has risen as he said, as all-powerful’. Therefore we worship you, the only immortal. O Christ, giver of life, have mercy on us.

By your Cross you destroyed the curse of the tree; by your burial you slew the might of death; by your Rising you enlightened the human race; therefore we cry out to you; ‘Benefactor, Christ our God, glory to you!’

The gates of death opened to you Lord, in fear; Hades’ gate-keepers shuddered when they saw you; for you smashed the gates of brass, crushed to powder the iron bars, led us out of darkness and the shadow of death and tore our bonds asunder.

As we sing the hymn of salvation, let this song rise from our lips; ‘Come all in the Lord’s house, let us fall down in worship as we say; ‘You who were crucified on the Tree, rose from the dead and are in the bosom of the Father, have mercy on our sins!’’

Glory…, Both now… **

**Theotokion.**

The shadow of the law has passed now that grace has come, for as the Bush in flames was not consumed, so as a Virgin you bore a Child and remained a Virgin; instead of a pillar of fire the Sun of righteousness has dawned, instead of Moses Christ, the salvation of our souls*.*

****

After the Entrance and

O Joyful Light…**, the designated Monk makes a metania to the Superior and sings the Prokeimenon of the day.**

The Lord is King: \* he has robed himself in majesty

****

Verse 1:

The Lord has robed and girded himself with power. ****

Verse 2:

He has made the world firm; it will not be shaken. ****

Then the usual Litany,

Grant Lord… **etc. and after the Ekphonesis we sing the idiomel Sticheron of the Saint of the Monastery as we process into the Narthex. After the usual prayers we return to the Church singing the**

Resurrection Aposticha.

Your Resurrection, O Christ Saviour, has enlightened the whole inhabited world; and you have called back your own creation. All-powerful Lord, glory to you!

****

In Alphabetical Order.

Verse 1:

The Lord is King: he has robed himself in majesty. The Lord has robed and girded himself with power. ****

D

estroying the curse of the tree through a tree, O Saviour, you slew the might of death by your burial, while you enlightened our race by your Rising; therefore we cry out to you; ‘Giver of life, Christ our God, glory to you!’ ****

Verse 2:

** He has made the world firm; it will not be shaken. ****

E

ven as you appeared nailed to the Cross, O Christ, you altered the beauty of created things; and while the soldiers showed their inhumanity by piercing your side with a lance, the Hebrews asked that your tomb be sealed, not understanding your power; but in your pitying compassion you accepted burial and rose on the third day. Lord, glory to you! ****

Verse 3:

Holiness befits your house, O Lord, to length of days. ****

F

or the sake of mortals, O Christ, Giver of life, willingly you underwent the Passion; as Powerful you descended into Hell, snatched as from the hand of a mighty one the souls of those who were waiting there for your coming and instead of Hades you granted them to dwell in Paradise. And so to us who glorify your Rising on the third day grant pardon of our sins and your great mercy.

Glory.Both now.

**Theotokion.**

O new wonder, greater than all the wonders of old! For who has ever known of a Mother who without a man has borne a child and carried in her arms the One who holds fast all creation? The Child conceived is the Counsel of God, whom you, All-pure, carried in your embrace and towards whom you have gained a mother’s freedom to speak. Therefore do not cease to intercede with him on behalf of those who honour you, that he take pity and save our souls.

****

Apolytikion.

When you went down to death, O immortal Life, then you slew Hell with the lightning flash of your Godhead; but when from the depths below the earth you raised the dead, all the Powers in the heavens cried out, ‘Giver of life, Christ our God, glory to you!’

****

Theotokion.

All your mysteries are beyond understanding, all beyond glory, Mother of God; sealed in purity and guarded in virginity you were known without deception to be a Mother, in giving birth to the true God: implore him that our souls may be saved.
