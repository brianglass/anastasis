ON MONDAY MORNING

AT MATINS

****

After the 1st reading from the Psalter Kathismata of Compunction.

When the judge takes his seat and the Angels stand round, the trumpet sounds and the flame burns, what will you do, my soul, as your brought to judgement? For then your dread deeds are present, your hidden crimes examined; and so before the end cry out: O God have mercy on me and save me!

****

Verse:

O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, or chastise me in your wrath.

My soul, what is here is temporary, what is there eternal; I see the court and the Judge upon his throne, and I tremble at the sentence; then turn back with speed: the judgement is unrelenting.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Let us believers praise.

Fervent and invincible defence, sure hope that cannot be put to shame, wall, protection and haven of those who flee to you, pure Ever-Virgin; with the Angels implore your Son and God to give peace to the world, salvation and his great mercy.

****

After the 2nd reading others.

Let us all keep vigil, and let us all go to meet Christ with much oil and shining lamps, that we may be worthy to enter the bridal chamber; for the one who is found outside the door cries out to God in vain: Have mercy on me!

****

Verse:

O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, or chastise me in your wrath.

As I lie on a bed of many sins I despoiled of my hope of salvation; for the sleep of my sloth invites punishment for my soul; but you, O God, born of a Virgin, rouse me to sung your praise, that I may glorify you.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

O All-blameless, holier than the Cherubim and higher than the heavens, as we confess you to be in truth Mother of God, we sinners have you as defence, and in temptations we find salvation; and so do not cease to intercede for us, the strength and refuge of our souls.

****

After the 3rd reading, others.

Let us believers praise.

I tremble at the fearful judgement, and I shudder at the JudgeÂ’s righteous sentence; for my conscience ever questions me; but living with indifference I am at a loss and I quail. By your holy prayers, Archangels, who watch over believers, rescue me from the fire.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Verse:

God is wonderful in his saints, the God of Israel.

The memory of the Champions shines to-day, for it takes its radiance from heaven; the choir of Angels keeps festival, and the human race feasts with them, and so they intercede with the Lord to have mercy on our souls.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Let us believers praise.

Gabriel marvellously brought to you on earth heavenÂ’s Hail; for seeing the Maker of the Angels incarnate in you, he sang you the song of joy, O Honoured One; through it teaching mortals that you the only cause of joy have appeared to all mankind.

Turn back, O Christ, one who has been enticed and baited by many tricks of the Stranger, and take pity as you are all-powerful.

O Christ, who opened the ears of the deaf man, open, I beg, the ears of my soul, that I may give ear to your words.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Declared newly appearing stars of the Sun of justice, Martyrs, scatter the darkness of our hearts.

Revealed as arrows fired by the divine coals of the Holy Spirit, the Athletes smash all the arrows of the serpent.

Gate of the divine glory, throw wide the gates of repentance to me, and snatch my lowly soul from the gates of Hell.

****

Another, Of the Bodiless Powers, of which the Acrostic is:

The fifth song for Angels.

****

Another Irmos.

You Angels, initiates of the light-giving source of Godhead, as first appearing bowed before its rays, implore the Master to flood my soul with light.

You have confidence, as you stand before the high throne; rescue from dangers all who devoutly hymn you, Leaders of the heavenly host, Chief Captains.

Because I have sinned in knowledge and in ignorance, I come to you, Christ Lord, who know all things, I fall before you; receive me as the Prodigal.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Embellished with sufferings and adorned with robes dyed in blood, O Martyrs, bearing crowns you now stand before the King of all.

****

Ode 4. Irmos.

The works of your dispensation, Lord, amazed the Prophet Avvakoum; for you came forth for the salvation of your people; you have come to save your anointed ones.

****

Troparia.

The works which I have accomplished in my life are grievous and evil; rescue me from them, Christ God, granting me genuine repentance.

I have despised every holy commandment, disabling the fear of you, O Christ, and I dread your infallible Tribunal; at which do not condemn me, O Compassionate.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Racked in deed from every side by thongs, wasted terribly by scourges, torn in pieces with iron claws, your Athletes, Lord, with faith were glad.

The evil one was utterly unable to shake you, noble Athletes, from your divine ground; and so when many were shaken you were shown to be inspired supports.

****

Theotokion.

The Lord took flesh from your pure blood, O All-praised, by your effective mediation he gives repentance to those who honour you, as he is compassionate and alone loves mankind.

Alas, why have I been likened to the barren fig tree, and quail at the curse with the felling? But Christ God, heavenly husbandman, make my parched soul fruitful, and like the Prodigal Son accept me and have mercy on me.

Overlook the multitudes of my offences, Lord, born of a Virgin, and wiping away all my iniquities, grant me the thought of returning, I beg, as you alone love mankind, and have mercy on me.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Blessed is the army of the King of heaven; for though the champions were born of earth, yet they hastened to attain the angelic rank, despising their bodies and through their sufferings being found worthy of the honour of the Bodiless Powers. At their prayers, Lord, send down to us your great mercy.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Make an end to the toil of my soul with its many groans, All-holy Virgin-mother, who made an end of every tear from the face of the earth; for you drive away the griefs of mortals, you abolish the dejection of sinners. We have all gained you as hope and support.
