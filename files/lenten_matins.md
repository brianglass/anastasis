NOTE
----

Most books prescribe the prayer O God save your people before psalm 50. This is anomalous, since liturgically it is linked to the order for the Gospel. It is omitted in the Ieratikon issued by the Holy Monastery of Simonos Petra on the Holy Mountain. I have given a reference to it in brackets at the appropriate point.

It is customary on the Holy Mountain to do a full censing during the first Ode of the Canon, whichever that may be, as on Sundays and Feasts.

The place at which the Troparia of the Canons are inserted vary from typikon to typikon. The standard Russian use is described in the translation of the Lenten Triodion by Mother Mary and Bishop Kallistos. Current Athonite practice is to insert the Troparia from the Menaion after the first four verses of the Biblical Canticle, and then recite the remaining verses, until the point at which the Canons from the Triodion are inserted, that is from 8 onwards.

The Triodion does not give precise references for the daily readings from [St Ephrem the Syrian](ephrem.md) and the Lausiac History of Palladios, nor more than it does for the reading from the ladder at the Hours. Some suitable material from St Ephrem will be found elsewhere on my pages.

MATINS

FOR WEEKDAYS IN LENT

The Royal Office

****

After the Dismissal of the Midnight Office the Priest, having made the customary metania to the Superior, or to his stall, enters the sanctuary and makes three bows before the holy Table. He puts on the Epitrachelion and, standing in front of the Holy Table, intones:

Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

Reader:

Amen. ****

We say first the Trisagion prayers.

Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us **

**(three times).**

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your nameÂ’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen

Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed; your kingdom come; your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

****

Priest:

For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. Lord, have mercy. **(x12)** Glory. Both now.
Come, let us worship and fall down before the King our God.
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ the King our God.
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King, our God. ****

Psalm 19

May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob shield you. May he send you his help from the holy place, and support you from Sion. May he remember your every sacrifice, and accept with favour your whole burnt offering. May the Lord give you your heartÂ’s desire, and fulfil your every purpose. We shall rejoice in your salvation, and be magnified in the name of our the Lord our God. May the Lord fulfil all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ. He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty acts is the salvation of his right hand. Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will call on the name of the Lord our God. They were fettered and fell, but we have risen and been set upright. Lord, save the king, and hear us on the day we call upon you. ****

Psalm 20

The king will rejoice in your power, O Lord, he will exult exceedingly in your salvation. You gave him his heartÂ’s desire; you did not deny him the request of his lips. For you came to meet him with blessings of goodness; you placed a crown of precious stones upon his head. He asked you for life, and you gave him length of days for age on age. Great is his glory because of your salvation; you will place on him glory and majesty. For you will give him blessing for age on age, and make him glad with the joy of your countenance. For the king puts his hope in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Most High he will not be shaken. May your hand light upon all your enemies, and your right hand find out all who hate you. You will make them like a blazing oven at the time of your presence. The Lord will confound them in his wrath and fire will devour them. You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their seed from among the children of mankind. Because they intended evils against you, and devised plans by which they can in no way succeed. For you will put them to flight; among your remnants you will prepare their presence. Be exalted, Lord, in your power; we will sing and praise your mighty acts.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us **

**(three times).**

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your nameÂ’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen

Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed; your kingdom come; your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

****

Priest:

For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

The Reader says the following Troparia:

Amen. Lord, save your people, and bless your inheritance, granting to faithful Christians victory over their enemies, and guarding your commonwealth by your Cross.

Glory.

Lifted up on the Cross of your own will, to the new commonwealth that bears your name grant your mercies, Christ God; make your faithful people glad by your power, granting them victories over their enemies; may they have your help in battle: a weapon of peace, an invincible trophy.

Both now. **

**Theotokion.**

Dread Champion who cannot be put to shame, do not despise our petitions, O Good One. All-praised Mother of God establish the commonwealth of the Orthodox, save your people and give them victory from heaven, for you gave birth to God, O only blessed one.

****

Priest:

Have mercy on us, O God, according to your great mercy. We pray you, hear and have mercy. ****

Reader:

Lord have mercy **(x3)**. ****

Priest:

For you, O God, are merciful, and love mankind, and to you we give glory, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. In the name of the Lord, bless Father. ****

Priest:

Glory to the holy, consubstantial, life-giving and undivided Trinity, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen.

The Six Psalms

****

And we begin the Six Psalms, listening with complete silence and compunction. The Superior, or the designated reader, with devotion and fear of God says:

Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth, goodwill among men

**(x3)**.

Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise

**(x2)***.* ****

Psalm 3

Lord, why have those who afflict me been multiplied? Many rise against me. Many say to my soul, Â‘There is no salvation for him in his GodÂ’. But you, Lord, are my helper, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. With my voice, I cried to the Lord, and he heard me from his holy mountain. I lay down and slept; I awoke, because the Lord will assist me. I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who surround me. Rise, Lord, save me, my God; because you have struck all who are vainly my foes. You have smashed the teeth of sinners. Salvation is the LordÂ’s, and your blessing is upon your people. ****

And again:

I lay down and slept; I awoke because the Lord will assist me.

****

Psalm 37

Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chastise me in your wrath. For your arrows have been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a heavy hand upon me. There is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in my bones on account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my head; like a heavy burden they weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank and festered on account of my foolishness. I was wretched and utterly bowed down; I went about mourning all day long. For my loins were filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated exceedingly; I howled from the groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning was not hidden from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and even the light of my eyes had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and stood against me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life used force, and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and meditated trickeries all day long. But I, like a deaf man, heard nothing; like one who is dumb, who does not open his mouth. So I became like one who cannot hear, and in whose mouth there are no rebukes. For in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will answer me, O Lord my God. For I said: Let my foes never exult over me. When my foot slipped they crowed over me. For I am ready for blows and my pain is with me continually. For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my sin. But my enemies live and have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly have been multiplied. Those who repay me with evils in place of good have slandered me, since I pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not go far from me. Hasten to help me, Lord of my salvation. ****

And again.

Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not go far from me.
Hasten to help me, Lord of my salvation.

****

Psalm 62

O God, my God, I watch for you at dawn; my soul has thirsted for you, my flesh how often in a desert, untrodden and waterless land. Thus I appeared before you in the holy place, to see your power and your glory. For your mercy is better than life; my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands. May my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; my mouth will praise you with joyful lips. When I remembered you upon my bed, every dawn I meditated upon you. For you became my helper, and in the shelter of your wings I shall rejoice. My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld me. But those who vainly sought my life will go down to the deepest parts of the earth, they will be delivered to the power of the sword, they will be portions for foxes. But the king will rejoice in God, and all who swear by him will be praised; for the mouths of those who speak iniquities have been stopped. ****

And again.

Every dawn I meditated upon you, for you became my helper, and in the shelter of your wings I shall rejoice.
My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld me.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit. Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God

**(x3, without Metanias).**

Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit. Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Psalm 87

Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day, and by night also before you. Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to my supplication. For my soul was filled with evils, and my life drew near to Hell. I was reckoned among those that go down to the Pit; I became as one that has no help, free among the dead. Like the slain that sleep in the tomb, whom you remembered no more; and they were cut off from your power. They placed me in the lowest Pit; in darkness and in the shadow of death. Your wrath lay heavy upon me, and you brought all your waves against me. You put my friends far from me, and made me an abomination to them. I was handed over and I came out; my eyes grew weak because of my beggary. I cried to you, Lord, all the day; I stretched out my hands towards you. Will you work wonders for the dead; or will physicians raise them up again to praise you? Will any declare your mercy in the tomb, or your truth in the place of destruction? Will your wonders be known in the dark, or your justice in a land that has been forgotten? But to you, Lord, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer will come before you. Why have you rejected my soul, Lord; why do you turn away your face from me? I am poor and in toils since my youth; exalted, I was humbled and brought to despair. Your fierce anger overwhelmed me, and your terrors appalled me. They surrounded me like water all day long; they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour you have put far from me, and my companions because of my misery. ****

And again.

Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day; and by night also before you.
Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn your ear to my supplication.

****

Psalm 102

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of his benefits. He forgives all your iniquities; he heals all your diseases; he redeems your life from corruption and crowns you with mercy and compassion; he satisfies your desire with good things; your youth will be renewed like an eagleÂ’s. The Lord performs deeds of mercy and judgement for all who are oppressed. He made known his ways to Moses, his wishes to the children of Israel. The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy. He will not always be wrathful, nor will he be enraged for ever. He has not dealt with us according to our iniquities, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For, like the height of heaven above the earth, the Lord has made his mercy prevail over those that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he taken our sins from us. As a father takes pity on his children the Lord has taken pity on those who fear him. For he knows of what we are made; has remembered that we are but dust. As for man, his days are but as grass, he will blossom like a flower of the field; for when a wind has passed over it, it will be no more and will know its place no longer. But the mercy of the Lord is for ever and ever upon those who fear him; and his justice upon their childrenÂ’s children, upon those who keep his covenant and remember his commandments to do them. The Lord has prepared his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Bless the Lord, all you his Angels, powerful in strength, who perform his word, and listen to the voice of his words. Bless the Lord, all you his Powers, his Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord, all you his works. In every place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul! ****

And again.

In every place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul!

****

Psalm 142

Lord, hear my prayer; in your truth give ear to my supplication, and in your justice hear me. Do not enter into judgement with your servant, for in your sight no one living can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul; humbled my life to the ground; made me dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit in me grew weary, and my heart was troubled within me. I remembered days of old; I meditated on all your works. I made the works of your hands my meditation. I stretched out my hands towards you; my soul thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord; my spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I should walk, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord; I have run to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land. For your nameÂ’s sake, O Lord, you will give me life. In your justice you will bring my soul out of trouble; in your mercy slay my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul, for I am your servant. ****

And again.

In your justice hear me, O Lord; and do not enter into judgement with your servant.

**(x2)**

Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land.

Glory. Both now.

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God.

**(x3). Metanias (x3).**

The Priest, having kissed the icon of the Lord, stands in front of the Holy Doors and intones the:

Litany of Peace
---------------

In peace, let us pray to the Lord.

****

People:

Lord, have mercy. **And so after each petition.**

For the peace from on high and for the salvation of our souls, let us pray to the Lord.

For the peace of the whole world, for the welfare of the holy Churches of God, and for the union of all, let us pray to the Lord.

For this holy house, and for those who enter it with faith, reverence and the fear of God, let us pray to the Lord.

For our Archbishop

**N.**, for the honoured order of presbyters, for the diaconate in Christ, for all the clergy and the people, let us pray to the Lord.

\[For our Sovereign Lady, Queen Elizabeth, the Royal Family, her Government, and all in authority, let us pray to the Lord.\]

For our father and superior, Priest-monk

**N.**, and all our brotherhood in Christ.

For this holy monastery, for monastery, city, town and village, and for the faithful who dwell in them, let us pray to the Lord.

For favourable weather, an abundance of the fruits of the earth, and temperate seasons, let us pray to the Lord.

For those who travel by land, air or water, for the sick, the suffering, for those in captivity, and for their safety and salvation, let us pray to the Lord.

For our deliverance from all affliction, wrath, danger and constraint, let us pray to the Lord.

Help us, save us, have mercy on us, and keep us, O God, by your grace.

Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most blessed and glorious Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, with all the Saints, let us entrust ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God.

****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

Priest:

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

People:

Amen. ****

After the Litany the Canonarch, or the appointed Monk, chants in the middle the

Alleluia ** **3 times according to the Tone of the Week, saying first one of the following verses.**

Verse 1:

From nightfall my spirit is awake for you, O God, for your commands are light upon the earth. ****

Verse 2:

Learn justice, inhabitants of the earth. ****

Verse 3:

Jealousy will seize an untaught people, and now fire devours their adversaries. ****

Verse 4:

Bring evils upon them, O Lord, bring evils upon them, the glorious ones of the earth. ****

And after the

Alleluia**, we sing the Hymns to the Trinity in the same tone, either singing the three once each, or the one three times, as the Superior decides. They are sung with melody, loudly and slowly.**

Then we recite one Kathisma of the Psalter. At each Section, at the

Alleluia*,* **we all make three prostrations.**

After the first reading from the Psalter, Kathismata from the Octoichos with the Theotokion in the Tone of the week, as above.

Then a Reading from [St Ephrem the Syrian](ephrem.md), by the Ephemerios.

After the second reading from the Psalter, Kathisma from the Triodion with its Theotokion.

And again a Reading from [St Ephrem](ephrem.md).

After the third reading from the Psalter another Kathisma from the Triodion with its Theotokion.

Then a Reading from the Lausiac History of Palladios.

After this we say Psalm 50

\[**and the usual prayer** O God, save your people\]. ****

Then Psalm 50, as follows.

Reader:

** Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Glory to the father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. ****

The appointed person:

** Both now and for ever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Have mercy on me O God, in accordance with your great mercy; according to the multitude of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you only I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words, and win when you are judged. For see, in wickedness I was conceived, and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have loved truth: you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed; you will wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your salvation, and establish me with a sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from bloodshed, and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips: and my mouth will declare your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it; you will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer calves upon your altar.

****

And we begin the Canons.

RECITATION OF THE NINE ODES

On MONDAYÂ— ODE 1

****

The Song of Moses in Exodus 15

Having utterly drowned Pharaoh in the deep Moses says:
Let us sing to the Lord, for he is greatly glorified.

Let us sing to the Lord, for he is greatly glorified: horse and rider he has cast into the sea.

Helper and protector he has become for my salvation: he is my God and I will glorify him; my fatherÂ’s God and I will exalt him.

The Lord shatters wars, the Lord is his name.

PharaohÂ’s chariots and army he has cast into the sea; his chosen mounted captains he has drowned in the Red Sea.

With the deep he covered them: they sank to the bottom like a stone.

Your right hand, Lord, has been glorified with strength; your right hand, Lord, has crushed enemies; and by the multitude of your glory you have smashed the opponents.

You sent forth your anger, it consumed them like a reed.

And through the spirit of your wrath the water parted; the waters became fixed like a wall, and the waves became fixed in the midst of the sea.

The enemy said: I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, I will fill my soul, I will destroy with my sword, my right hand shall lord it.

You sent forth your spirit, the sea covered them, they sank like lead in a mass of water.

Who is like you among the gods, Lord? Who is like you? Glorified in holiness, wondrous in glories, performing marvels.

You stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them down.

You guided this people of yours, which you have redeemed; by your strength you have called them into your holy resting-place.

Nations heard and were enraged; pangs have seized the inhabitants of Phylistiim.

****

For 8 verses.

Then the leaders of Edom and the rulers of the Moabites hastened: trembling took hold of them: all the inhabitants of Canaan melted away.

Let fear and trembling fall upon them: by the greatness of your arm let them be turned to stone.

****

For 6 verses.

Till your people pass over, O Lord: till your people, whom you have purchased, pass over.

The sanctuary which you have made, Lord: which your hands have prepared.

****

For 4 verses.

The Lord reigns over the ages and for ever and ever: for PharaohÂ’s horse went with the chariots and horsemen into the sea.

But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.

Glory. Both now.

On TUESDAYÂ— ODE 2

****

Note that the 2nd ode is never recited, except only in great Lent. After the 1st we recite it through to the end. For the Troparia we say before each one:

Glory to you, our God, glory to you*.* ****

The Song of Moses in Deuteronomy. Chap. 32:1.

After the law was written, once more a song of Moses.

Attend, O heaven, and I shall speak; and let earth hear the words from my mouth.

Let my utterance be looked for like rain, and let my words come down like dew, like a shower upon herbage, and like snow on grass.

Because I have called on the name of the Lord; ascribe majesty to our God.

God, his works are true, and all his ways judgements.

God is faithful, and there is no injustice in him; just and holy the Lord.

Blameworthy children, have they not sinned against him; perverse and crooked generation, do you thus repay the Lord?

Foolish this people, and not wise; is he not your Father who created you, and made you, and fashioned you?

Remember days of old, understand years, generations of generations.

Question your father, and he will tell you; your elders and they will speak to you.

When the Most High divided the nations, when he scattered the children of Adam, he set boundaries for the nations according to the number of the Angels of God.

And his people Jacob became the LordÂ’s portion; Israel the line of his inheritance.

He sustained them in the desert, in thirst from heat in a waterless land; he encircled him and instructed him and guarded him as the apple of his eye.

As an eagle longed to protect its brood, and its nestlings, spreading its wings, he received them and bore them up on his pinions.

The Lord alone led them, and their was no foreign god with them.

He made them mount on the strength of the land; he fed them with the produce of the fields.

They sucked honey from a rock, and oil from a solid rock.

Butter from oxen and milk from sheep, with the fat of lambs and rams, of the offspring of bulls and goats, with the fat of kidneys, of wheat, and they drank wine, the blood of the grape.

And Jacob ate and was filled, and the beloved kicked; he grew sleek, he grew fat, he was broadened and abandoned the God who made him, and rebelled from God his saviour.

They provoked me with foreign \[gods\], and embittered me with their abominations.

They sacrificed to demons and not to God; to gods they had not known; new ones, recently arrived, whom their fathers had not known.

You abandoned the God who begot you, and forgot the God who nurtures you.

And the Lord saw and grew jealous, and was provoked through anger of his sons and daughters.

And he said: I shall turn away my face from them, and I shall show them what will happen to them at the last; because it is a perverse generation; children who have no faith in them.

They have moved me to jealousy over what is not god, they have angered me by their idols; I too will move them to jealousy over what is not a nation, over a nation without understanding I shall anger them.

Because fire has been kindled from my wrath, it will kindled as far as the lowest hell; it devours the earth and its produce; it will consume the foundations of the mountains.

I shall gather evils against them, and exhaust my arrows against them.

On WEDNESDAY Â— ODE 3

****

The Prayer of Anne, the mother of the Prophet Samuel. 1 Reigns 2.

A barren women strangely bearing child praises God.
Holy are you, O Lord, and my spirit sings your praise.

My heart is established in the Lord, my spirit is exalted in my God: my mouth derides my enemies, I rejoice in your salvation.

There is none holy like the Lord, and none just like our God.

Do not boast or talk so very proudly: let no arrogance come from your mouth.

For the Lord is a God of knowledge: and God prepares his ways.

He has weakened the bow of the mighty, and the weak have girded themselves with power.

Those who were full of bread have been brought low, and the hungry have deserted the land; because a barren woman has given birth to seven, and she who has many children has grown weak.

The Lord kill and gives life, leads down to hell and leads up.

The Lord makes poor and makes rich, humbles and exalts.

Makes the pauper rise from the earth, and raises the poor from the dunghill, to seat him with the powerful of the people, giving him a throne of glory as his inheritance.

****

For 8 verses.

He grants the prayers of him who prays: and blesses the years of the just.

Because a powerful man has no strength in his strength. The Lord will weaken his adversary: the Lord is holy.

****

For 6 verses.

Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom, nor the powerful boast of his power, nor the wealthy boast of his wealth.

But let him who boasts boast of this: of understanding and knowing the Lord: and of executing judgement and justice in the midst of the earth.

****

For 4 verses.

The Lord has gone up to the heavens and thundered: being just he will judge the ends of the earth.

He will give strength to our kings: and exalt the horn of his anointed ones.

Glory. Both now.

On THURSDAY Â— ODE 4

****

The Prayer of the Prophet Avvakoum. Chap. 3:1

Avvakoum express the self-emptying of the Word.**
**Glory to your power, O Lord.

Lord, I heard your report and was afraid: Lord I considered your works and was amazed.

In the midst of two living creatures you will be known, when the years draw near you will be recognised, when the moment comes you will be revealed. When my soul is troubled, in anger you will remember mercy.

God will come from Theman: and the Holy One from a shady, wooded mountain.

His glory covered the heavens: and the earth was full of his praise.

And his radiance will like light; horns in his hands and he set up a mighty love of his strength.

A word will go before his face, and will go out for chastisement at his feet.

He stood, and the earth was shaken; he looked, and nations melted away.

The mountains were broken in pieces by force, everlasting hills melted away; instead of toils I saw his everlasting paths.

The tents of the Ethiopians quivered with fear, and the tabernacles of the land of Madian.

Were you enraged at rivers, Lord? Was your wrath at rivers? Or your indignation at the sea? Because you mounted on your horses, and your cavalry is salvation.

You draw, you draw your bow against sceptres, says the Lord; the land of rivers will be rent.

Peoples will see you and be in pain, as you scatter moving waters; the deep uttered its voice, the height of its appearance.

The sun was raised high and the moon stood in her course; your thunderbolts will go forth at the light, at the radiance of the lightning of your weapons.

With a threat you will bring low the earth, and with rage bring down nations.

You went forth for the salvation of your people, you have come to your save your anointed ones, you hurled death on the heads of the lawless, you raised bonds as far as the neck to the end.

You cut open in amazement the heads of the powerful; they will be shaken by them, they will break open their bridles, like a poor man eating in secret.

And you made your horses mount upon the sea, as they troubled many waters.

I kept watch, and my heart quivered with fear, from the sound of the prayer of my lips; and trembling entered my bones, and my strength was troubled within me.

I shall rest in the day of my trouble, from going up to the people of my sojourning.

Prayer of the Prophet Isaias. Chap. 26:9.

IsaiasÂ’ prophecy, a perfect prayer.
Lord our God give us peace.

From nightfall my spirit is awake for you, O God: for your commands are light upon the earth.

Learn justice, inhabitants of the earth.

The impious has come to an end; everyone who has in no way learnt justice upon earth will not do truth at all. Let the impious be taken away, that he may not see the glory of the Lord.

Lord your hand was lifted up and they knew it not; but once they know they will be ashamed.

Jealousy will seize an untaught people: and now fire devours their adversaries.

Lord our God, give us peace; for all things you have given back to us.

Lord our God, possess us; Lord, we no other but you, we name your name.

The dead may in no way see life, nor will physicians raise them up; because of this you have brought out and destroyed and taken away every one of their males.

****

****

For 4 verses.

The dead shall arise and those in the graves shall be raised: and those in the earth shall rejoice.

For the dew which comes from you is healing for them: but the land of the impious shall perish. Go, my people, enter your chamber, shut your door, be hidden for a little while, until the anger of the Lord has passed by.

Glory. Both now.

Prayer of the Prophet Jonas. Chap. 2:2.

Prayer of the Three Holy Youths. Dan. 3.

Praise of the three holy Youths quenches a flame.
Our God and the God of our fathers, blessed are you.

Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers: and praised and glorified is your name for evermore.

For you are just in all that you have done for us.

And all your works are true, and your ways are right, and all your judgements are true: and judgements of truth you have executed in all that you have brought upon us.

And upon Jerusalem the city of our fathers. Because in truth you have brought all these things upon us, because of our sins.

Because we have sinned and committed iniquity in departing from you, and we have sinned in all things, and we have not obeyed your commandments, nor kept them, nor have we done as you commanded us, that it might be well with us.

And all that you have done to us, and all that you have brought upon us, you have done with true judgement; and you handed us over into the hands of our lawless foes, hateful rebels, and to an unjust and king, the most evil in all the earth.

And now we cannot open our mouth; we have become a shame and disgrace to your servants, and to those who honour you.

Do not hand us over for ever, for your holy nameÂ’s sake, and do not annul your testament, and do not withdraw your mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham your beloved, and Isaac your servant, and Israel your holy one.

To whom you said that you would multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the shore of the sea.

Because, Master, we have become smaller than all the nations, and we are humbled in all the earth to-day because of our sins.

And at this moment there is neither prince, nor prophet nor leader; neither holocaust, nor sacrifice, not offering, nor incense; no place to make an offering before you and to find mercy.

Yet with a contrite heart and with a spirit of humility may we be accepted.

As though with holocausts of rams and bulls and tens of thousands of fat lambs, so may our sacrifice be acceptable before you to-day, and may it be perfected behind you; because there is no shame for those who trust in you.

And now we are following you with our whole heart, and we fear you, and seek your face; do not put us to shame.

But do with us according to your fairness, and according to the multitude of your mercy.

deliver us according to your wondrous works, and give glory to your name, O Lord.

And let all who harm your servants be disgraced, and put to shame from all their power, and let their strength be smashed.

And let them know that you alone are Lord God, and glorious in the whole inhabited world.

And the kingÂ’s servants, who cast them in, did not cease stoking the furnace with naphtha, pitch, tow and brushwood.

And the flame poured out above the furnace forty nine cubits; and it spread out and burnt up those of the Chaldeans it found around the furnace.

But the Angel of the Lord came down into the furnace with Azarias and his companions, and shook the flame of the fire out of the furnace.

And he made the midst of the furnace as though a moist wind were whistling through it; and the fire did not touch them at all, nor hurt them, nor trouble them.

Then the Three as with one voice, hymned, blessed and glorified God in the furnace, saying:

For he has regarded the lowliness of his handmaiden, for behold from henceforth all generations will call me blessed.

For he that is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name, and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.

He has shown strength with his arm, he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.

He has put down the mighty from their thrones and exalted the humble: he has filled the hungry with good things and the rich he has sent away empty.

He has helped Israel his servant in remembrance of his mercy, as he spoke to our fathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.

Psalm 148

Praise the Lord from the heavens; praise him in the highest. To you praise is due, O God.

Praise him, all his angels: Praise him, all his Powers. To you praise is due, O God.

Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you stars and light.

Praise him, you highest heavens and you waters that are above the heavens. Let them praise the name of the Lord.

For he spoke and they came into being; he commanded and they were created.

He established them for ever and ever; he made an ordinance, and it shall not pass away.

Praise the Lord from the earth; praise him, you sea-monsters and all deeps;

Fire and hail, snow and ice and storm-wind; things that do his word.

Mountains and all hills, fruiting trees and all cedars;

Beasts of the wild, and all cattle, creeping things and winged birds;

Kings of the earth and all peoples, rulers and all judges of the earth;

Young men and maidens: old men and youths together, let them praise the name of the Lord; for his name alone has been exalted.

His praise is above earth and heaven, and he will exalt the horn of his people.

A hymn for all his holy ones; for the children of Israel, a people that draws near him.

****

Psalm 149

Sing to the Lord a new song, his praise in the Church of the holy ones.

Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, let the children of Sion be joyful in their king.

Let them praise his name in the dance; let them sing his praise with timbrel and with harp.

For the Lord is well-pleased with his people; he will exalt the meek with salvation.

His holy ones will exult in glory, and rejoice upon their beds.

The high praises of God in their mouths, and two-edged swords in their hands,

To exact vengeance among the nations, punishments among the peoples.

To bind their kings in fetters; and their nobles in shackles of iron.

To execute upon them the judgement that is decreed; such glory will be for all his holy ones.

****

Psalm 150

Praise God in his saints; praise him in the firmament of his power.

Praise him for his mighty acts; praise him according to the greatness of his majesty.

Praise him with the sound of the trumpet; praise him with lute and harp.

Praise him with timbrel and dance; praise him with strings and pipe.

Praise him with tuneful cymbals; praise him with loud cymbals. Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.

Glory.

We go back to our mats and, standing on the level, we begin the Doxology in a meek and level voice, all making three prostrations as well.

Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill among men. We praise you, we bless you, we worship you, we glorify you, we give you thanks for your great glory. Lord, King, God of heaven, Father almighty: Lord, only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ and Holy Spirit. Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, who take away the sin of the world, have mercy on us; you take away the sins of the world. Receive our prayer, you who sit on the right hand of the Father, and have mercy on us. For you alone are holy, you alone are Lord, Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the Father. Amen.

Every day I will bless you, and praise your name for ever and to the ages of ages. Lord, you have been our refuge from generation to generation. I said, Lord, have mercy on me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against you. Lord, I have run to you for refuge: teach me to do your will, for you are my God. For with you is the source of life: and in your light we shall see light. Continue your mercy towards those who know you.

Grant, Lord, this day to keep us without sin. Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers, and praised and glorified your name to the ages. Amen. May your mercy, O Lord, be upon us, as we have put our hope in you. Blessed are you, Lord, teach me your statutes. Blessed are you, Master, make me understand your statutes. Blessed are you, Holy One, enlighten me with your statutes. Lord, your mercy is for ever; do not scorn the work of your hands. To you praise is due, to you song is due, to you glory is due, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
