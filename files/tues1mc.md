ON TUESDAY MORNING

AT MATINS

****

After the 1st Reading from the Psalter, Kathismata.

Kathismata of Compunction. Tone 1.

Conceived in iniquities, I, the wastrel, dare not raise my gaze to the height of heaven, but confident in your love for humankind I cry: O God be merciful to me and save me.

****

Verse:

Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger; nor chastise me in your wrath.

If the just can scarcely be saved, how shall I the sinner appear? I have not borne the burden and heat of the day; number me with those of the eleventh hour, O God, and save me.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Come, believers, having gained Mary the Mother of God as an unbreachable wall, let us fall down before her, for she has freedom to speak with the One who was born from her, to intercede and to save our souls from wrath and death.

****

After the 2nd reading other Kathismata.
The soldiers watching.

Hasten to open to me your fatherly embrace; like the Wastrel I have squandered my whole life, turning from your pity, O Saviour, to wealth which cannot be spent; do not now despise my beggared heart; for to you, Lord, with compunction I cry, Â‘I have sinned against you, save me!Â’

****

Verse:

** Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger; nor chastise me in your wrath.

The judgment seat is fearful and the judgment just; my deeds are dreadful, but, O Merciful, speedily save me and rescue me from punishment; deliver me, Master, from the portion of the goats, to stand me on your right hand, Judge most just.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.
Same melody.**

Put away, my soul, the sleep of sloth and light the bright lamp of repentance, and now go out, bidding farewell to the confusion of life, to meet the immortal Bridegroom, saying, Â‘Accept and do not reject me, O Word, at the supplications of the one who gave you birthÂ’.

****

After the 3rd Reading, Other Kathismata.
The soldiers watching.

John, who of old baptized in JordanÂ’s streams the Purification of all the world, draw me out, who am drowned by many offences, and wash me clean of every kind of stain, as you ever entreat the Lover of humankind as an acceptable intercessor.

****

Verse:

God is wonderful in his Saints, the God of Israel. ****

Of the Martyrs.
When the stone had been sealed.

As good soldiers, believing with one accord, not trembling before the threats of tyrants, you fervently drew near to Christ, O Saints, having taken up the precious Cross, and having finished your course, you received victory from heaven. Glory to him who gave you strength; glory to him who crowned you; glory to him who through you grants healings to all.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.
The soldiers watching.**

John, leaping in his motherÂ’s womb, by grace recognised God being carried in your womb, pure Virgin, and faithfully worshipped. But I implore you, O Virgin, with the Forerunner, entreat the Word, to whom you gave a body, that your servant may be saved.

Of the Martyrs

Χ

The choirs of Champions have been glorified, for with their limbs they glorified Christ, who put on flesh and through suffering made corruption vanish. ****

Ο

Towers and champions of the Church, the glorious Martyrs endured unshaken by the assaults of the foe. At their intercessions, O God, give life to us all. ****

Theotokion

As a throne formed of fire you bear the Creator; as a living bridal chamber and palace of delight, you hold the King, who became what we are, without change and confusion.

of which the Acrostic is:

Listen to the voice of those who cry to you, blest Saint. Joseph. ****

S

O Jesu, save the wastrel; save me, who have alone transgressed your saving laws, and irrationally committed every sin and been made subject to thoughts that alienate from you, good Lord. ****

Of the Martyrs

T

The host of Bodiless Powers was truly amazed at your courage, Holy Ones, how you wondrously competed in the stadium and falling in body you threw down in one godly moment all your bodiless opponents. ****

E

Still decked out with the blood from your wounds; still drenched in gore, O Champions, you stand beside the Lord, the immortal King, all garlanded with victorsÂ’ crowns. ****

Theotokion

You give birth the One whom the Father begot before all ages; you nourish the nourisher without knowing man. Wondrous the marvel! New the mystery, O Full of grace! Therefore the souls of all believers magnify you.

****

Of the Forerunner. The same Irmos.

****

S

In holiness, O Forerunner, you sprouted from a barren mother without fruit, and by divine husbandry you appeared bearing fruit. Therefore make my heart, barren of everything, a source of fair offspring, that I may ever faithfully glorify you. ****

The wealth you gave me I have squandered wickedly, committing monstrous deeds and now am naked, clothed in the works of dishonour. And so I cry to you, Â‘Make me radiant with robes, goading me to repentance by divine graceÂ’. ****

U

With bodily nakedness you wove yourself a cloak of salvation, Baptist of the Lord. Clothe me, stripped bare of every good work, I beg, with a garment of justice and gladness. ****

Forerunner, who plunged in the streams of Jordan a torrent of delight, Jesus the giver of life, rain on me too, who am wasted away by the drought of pleasures, one drop of salvation, that as is fitting I may glorify you. ****

It is not an Angel, not an envoy that saved us, but the Lord himself, when he came on earth and whose straight ways you had prepared, blest Saint. Implore him now to show me the path that leads to the Kingdom. ****

I have been filled with many and grievous offences, longsuffering, compassionate Master. Have compassion on me, who am condemned, and do not cast me away from your presence. ****

T

You justified the Tax-collector, O Christ, when he sighed and groaned; therefore I too, imitating him, beat my breast and cry to you, Â‘Have mercy on me, O only compassionate and pityingÂ’. ****

Of the Martyrs

O

Your Saints, Lord, appeared like unerring beacons, dispelling the deep night of error and making the whole inhabited world bright with the torchlight of their wonders. ****

U

Like priceless stones, Master, the Martyrs, yearning for you, the Rock of life, crushed through torments, destroyed the whole dispensation of error. ****

A myriad multitude of holy Athletes trampled underfoot myriads of spiritual foes and were united with the myriads of heavenly Minds. ****

Having dried up the deep of godlessness, O Athletes, you were filled with the torrent of delight, and so dry up the out-pourings of my sins. ****

Theotokion

Revealed as a tabernacle of sanctification, Mary, sanctify my wretched soul, befouled by pleasures, and make a partaker in divine glory.

****

Of the Forerunner. The same Irmos.

O

Baptist, who on earth proclaimed repentance, show me ways of repentance that guide me to the light, and deliver me from the chasms of error. ****

Troparia

U

Job practised patience and in all the assaults of the evil one remained unshaken, like a noble tower. Always match him, my soul, and never tire in troubles. ****

I have been worsted by bodily pleasures, and though a rational being, have become irrational. O Word of God, who saved the harlot by a word, save me, coward that I am, that I may hymn and bless your goodness. ****

Of the Martyrs

L

Wise Martyrs, redeemed by the blood of the One who suffered in the flesh for us, with eagerness you chose to shed your own blood for him; and so you reign with him for ever. ****

Glorious, noble Baptist, who became mediator of the old and new covenants, mediate for me who have become old in sins by entreating Jesus, the one who makes all things new, to make me wholly new. ****

On earth you appeared, Forerunner of Christ and Baptist, prescribing repentance. By your prayers give us strength to accomplish this, that we may be rescued from the innumerable evils, with by we are always offending. ****

S

You travelled the narrow way, pursuing complete self-mastery, wise Saint, and have been wholly glorified with the broad place of the brightest visions. By interceding with Christ grant that we too may enjoy them. ****

All-honoured Athletes of the Lord, affliction, danger, sword nor fire parted you in any way from the love of Christ, who because of his compassion has loved us. ****

S

Locked in bodily combat body with a bodiless opponent, you threw him down, noble Athletes, and you dance with the Bodiless powers, healing the passions of our souls and bodies. ****

Theotokion

Having found you as a lily in the valleys of life, the Planter of all things dwelt in you, and now with sweet perfumes of virtue and honour he makes us fragrant, O Mother of God.

M

Alone above all those born on earth have I offended, alone have I become a transgressor of your laws, O Lord. Therefore through the Forerunner take pity on me and save me. ****

With bodiless Angels, with revered Apostles, with holy Champions, and with Prophets, O Prophet, ever implore God who is supremely good, that we, who are enriched with you as good protector, may obtain eternal good things. ****

All-praised Martyrs.**

Virgin all-praised, Moses with prophetic eyes saw the mystery that is in you, the bush that though in flames was unburned. For the fire of the Godhead did not burn up your womb, pure Maiden. And so we ask you, as Mother of our God, to grant peace to the

world.
