AT VESPERS
==========

**Prosomia. Tone 8. What should we call you.**

What should I name you, Apostle? Heaven, for you declare the glory of God. River, for mystically you water creation. Star, which sheds its light on the Church. Mixing-bowl, which pours out a holy draught. True Friend of Christ. Companion of the Bodiless Powers. Intercede that our souls may be saved.

Apostle, truly inspired, you were sent out from Christ like a thunderbolt formed of light, wounding enemies, plainly predicting healing for wounded souls; and so, as is fitting, we call you blessed and celebrate today your holy festival. Intercede that our souls may be saved.

Glorious Apostle, who saw God, your feet were made beautiful as they trod the ways of the Lord, and narrowed the ways of the ill-intentioned by the broadening of the divine knowledge of the Word, who appeared in a material body and chose you, blessed one, as a glorious Disciple. Implore him that our souls may be saved.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Those who were granted to see in bodily form the dignity of the Father and his Godhead, proclaimed you, Maiden, as Bride and Virgin, Mother of the Word and God, and dwelling of the Holy Spirit; for in you the Godhead dwelt entirely in bodily form, the fullness of fullest grace.

****

Or Cross-Theotokion.

When the Ewe-lamb who bore you saw you nailed to the Tree, Lord, she tore at her eyes and cried aloud in lamentation, ‘My Son, how do you endure unjust slaughter? How can you, the Immortal, die as a mortal? Give me a word, sweetest light. Look at your Mother as she mourns for you, and glorify her, O Word, by your rising’.

Theotokion. Same melody.

You became a divine tabernacle of the Word, alone all-pure Mother of God, who in purity surpass the Angels; with the inspired streams of your intercessions, purify me, who above all others have become dust made foul by faults of the flesh, and grant me his great mercy.

****

Or Cross-Theotokion. Awed by the beauty.

A rational heaven declared you to all as the Redeemer of the universe, thundering out in the world that you were God incarnate, and urging all to cry: God of our Fathers, blessed are you!

Like a lyre made by God, tuned to the word of the Almighty and divinely struck by the Holy Spirit, with the nations you chanted: God of our Fathers, blessed are you!
