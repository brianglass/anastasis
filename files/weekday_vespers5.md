ON SUNDAY EVENING
-----------------

**VESPERS**

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **Prosomia of the Lord.
O marvellous wonder!**

Oh, how I continue without a care! Heedlessly I pass the time I have for life, not thinking of my many sins, nor the dread threat of death and the impartiality of the trial. Oh, who will deliver me from the everlasting fire, unless you, my God, alone most good, take pity on me?

Alas, my wretched soul, how greatly you will lament there, when the just are called to the everlasting kingdom, but you are condemned to everlasting fire on account of your deeds! Groan, weep; from this moment run to the Redeemer Christ and wash away your sins.

As long as the time of this present life is there for you, O soul, repent and toil on account of your sins here, that there you may find rest and be delivered from eternal punishment. Lord, Lord, loving and compassionate, grant that I may become a sharer in the destiny of the chosen.

****

Other Prosomia, of the Bodiless Powers.
Lord, though at the judgement seat.

O Lord, the ranks of the Bodiless Ones glorify you without ceasing, filled with joy at your beauty and richly irradiated by your inexpressible loveliness and three-sunned radiance. At their prayers and intercessions, Saviour, save our souls.

O Lord, you brought into existence the all-harmonious choirs of the Angels by your all-powerful Word, and by your holy Spirit favouring them with the brightness of your unchanging rays. At their prayers and intercessions, Saviour, save our souls.

O Lord, the Seraphim hymn you, Powers and Angels, Principalities, Dominions, Thrones and Virtues, and Archangels and the awesome Cherubim offer their praise. At their prayers and intercessions, Saviour, save our souls.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.
O marvellous wonder!**

Hail, destruction of demons; hail, daughter of Adam, who truly flowered with the flower that does not fade; hail glory of your servants; hail all-unblemished, release from dangers; hail gift given by God; preservation of the world of those who call upon you; hail, Holy one. Hail, Sovereign Lady, glory of those who glorify you.

****

Aposticha of Compunction.

Angels hymn you without ceasing as King and Master; but I fall before you like the Publican crying: O God, be merciful to me and save me.

My soul, you are immortal, do not hide yourself with the waves of life; come to your senses as you cry out to your Benefactor: O God, be merciful to me and save me.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Martyrs of the Lord, you hallow every place and heal every disease; and now we beg intercede that our souls may be delivered from the snares of the foe.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.
O marvellous wonder!**

Hail living palace, spiritual dove, hail city of your Creator; hail refuge and bulwark of the faithful, the protection, the salvation and the redemption of those who trust in you; hail bridge leading all across to heaven; hail all-blessed, holy Sovereign Lady!

**AT VESPERS**

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **Prosomia of the Lord.
Tone 8. O marvellous wonder!**

To what have you been likened, my soul, who have passed your life in great idleness, and weighed down by the profound sleep of a harsh fall? Run, hurry, and fall down before the one who knows all things; weep and ask time for repentance for yourself, before, unhappy wretch, you become fuel for the unquenchable fire.

O Christ, you know the weakness of human flesh, and the feebleness of nature you understand, Master, as Maker and God; still the tempest of my heart by giving calm to my lowly soul; set me upright again from my wicked deeds and deliver me from the unquenchable fire, as you alone are compassionate.

I have squandered my whole livelihood and my life shamefully and prodigally, making no account at all of the punishments there; but, my God, my Saviour, receive me as I turn back, as the Prodigal, at the holy entreaties of your Forerunner, all your Saints and her who bore you, O Christ, and save me.

****

Other stichera, of the Forerunner.
The same melody.

Shoot of the barren, plant of purity, adornment of mortals, the Master’s Forerunner, all-praised John, the godly guardian of my lowly soul, give me your intercession and help, delivering me from the wiles of the serpent and from his evil attack and assault.

That I may glorify and reverence, that I may honour and praise and celebrate with faith your divine and radiant name, O named after grace, do not ever abandon your servant, do not part from me, godly Forerunner; but with the wings of your holy intercession, shelter me at all times and guard me from evils of every kind.

You are wholly filled with sweetness and godlike delight, revered Forerunner, and you make glad those who approach with faith, as sweeten the senses of both soul and body and always rescue us from afflictions, disasters, evils and soul-destroying pains.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. The same.**

Hail, Mother of God, Sovereign Lady; hail, Immaculate, pure dwelling place of God; hail, who contained God, godlike chariot of the Word; hail, palace made by God; hail, treasure given by God, living bridal chamber, godlike table and ark of God, and dwelling place of the divine Spirit.

****

Aposticha of Compunction.

Angels hymn you ceaselessly the King and Master, while I fall before you as the Publican crying: God be merciful to me, and save me!

My soul you are immortal, do not be overwhelmed by the waves of life; rouse yourself and cry to your benefactor: God be merciful to me, and save me!

****

Of the Martyrs.

Martyrs of the Lord, intercede with our God, and ask for our souls a multitude of mercies, and the pardon of our many offences, we beg

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Your protection, Virgin Mother of God, is a spiritual surgery; for when we take refuge in it we are delivered from the diseases of the soul.

<span style="text-transform: uppercase">on tuesday evening</span>

**<span style="text-transform: uppercase">AT VESPERS</span>**

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **we insert 6 stichera and sing Prosomia of the Cross.
Tone 8. O marvellous wonder.**

O Word of God, supremely good, as one condemned hanged on a Cross for us, snatch us from the fire to come, from dread condemnation and from every other penalty, at the entreaties of the Mother of God. For day after day by thoughts we all anger you, O Christ, supremely good and lover of humankind.

Seeing you nailed to the Cross by your own will, O Jesu, the sun shuddered, the earth was shaken, the rocks were rent, the graves opened in fear and all the Powers of heaven stood amazed. As the Virgin saw you on the Cross, Master, she cried out, ‘Alas! What is this sight?’

O the infinite goodness of the one incarnate from you, all-praised Mother of God. For he willingly endured Cross and death, that he might save the world that he had fashioned. Implore him from punishment to deliver me also, wretched and most woeful, and to make me dwell where the light that knows no evening shines.

****

Others, of the Mother of God. Same melody.

Hail, Virgin, Bride of God! Hail, hope of believers! Hail, cleansing of the world! Hail, who save your servants from every affliction. Hail, abolition of death! Hail, life-bearing Paradise! Hail, hope of those who call on you! Hail, godlike Dwelling-place of God and holy Mountain!

Hail, Mother of God, all-pure! Hail, source of life! Hail, heavenly Ladder! Hail, Sovereign lady of the whole world! Hail, blessed and all-unblemished one! Hail, glorified and unspotted! Hail, all-praised! Hail, divine Tabernacle! Hail, most revered! Hail, Virgin Mother, Bride without bridegroom!

Hail, Lady, Mother of God! Hail, only hope and assistance of mortals! Hail, refuge! Hail, Lamp-stand of light! Hail, resplendent Palace! Hail, light-bearing Lamp-holder! Hail, unsullied boast of virginity! Hail, Source, pouring out healings for those who draw near you!

Glory. Both now.

**Cross-Theotokion. Same melody.**

‘O marvellous wonder! O new mystery! O dread transaction!’ said the Virgin, as she watched you, whom she had borne without pangs, hanged on a Cross between two thieves. She was weeping and crying out, ‘Alas, dearest Child, how has a cruel and ungrateful people nailed you to a Cross?’

****

Aposticha of the Cross.

You were lifted up on a Cross, Christ our God, and you saved the human race. We glorify your sufferings.

You were fixed to a cross, Christ our God, and you opened the gates of Paradise. We glorify you, our Redeemer.

****

Of the Martyrs. Model melody.

You Martyrs, Lord, forgetting the things of this life and despising torments for the sake of life to come, were declared its inheritors. Therefore they rejoice too with the Angels. At their intercessions, grant your people your great mercy.

Glory. Both now.

**Cross-Theotokion.**

When she who gave you birth saw you, the only long-suffering, nailed to a Cross, lamenting she let fall floods of tears and, struck with great amazement at your surpassing goodness and your more than human compassion, she sang the praise of your might.

ON WEDNESDAY EVENING
--------------------

**AT VESPERS**

****

At

Lord, I have cried*,* **Prosomia of the Apostles.
Tone 8. Lord, though at the judgement seat.**

Lord, with the beam of the Spirit you enlightened your Apostles, and set them as beacons, lighting the inhabited world with the spiritual illumination of your knowledge, Master; and so we worship your great goodness.

Lord, as with the prayers of the Apostles you wall about your flock, you preserve it undisturbed from the assault of foes; when you bought it with your precious blood, O Saviour, you freed it from the slavery of the stranger, as you are compassionate.

You appeared on the diadem of Christ’s Church as precious stones, blazing with radiant brilliance for the inhabited world: the light of the knowledge of God, blest Apostles, attendants of the Trinity and intercessors for our souls.

****

Others of St Nicholas, to the same melody.

Lord, at the godly and all-acceptable supplications of the Hierarch, free from every danger and every evil and every assault of evil men, O Lover of mankind, your servants who worship with faith your incomparable might.

Lord, you revealed your Hierarch as a sweet fragrance in the world; for now he makes the hearts of all believers fragrant by wonders, as by your grace he drives away diseases and passions of souls; at his prayers, as you are merciful, protect those who hymn you.

Lord, you have glorified your revered Hierarch in the ends of the earth, giving him the grace of wonders, and you have revealed him to be a champion of those who in dire dangers and evils of tribulations fall down and ask for his continual help.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. Same melody.**

Look on the groans of my broken heart, O Bride of God; accept and do not despise, pure Virgin Mary, the lifting up of my hands, as you love goodness, that I may hymn and magnify him who magnified our race.

Aposticha of the Apostles. Same melody.

Lord, the Apostles longed for you sincerely upon earth, and considered all things to be rubbish, that they might gain you, and they handed over their bodies to tortures for your sake; and so they have been glorified and they intercede on behalf of our souls.

Lord, you have magnified upon earth the memory of the Apostles; for all assembled together we glorify you by it; because through them you grant us healings and at their prayers peace to the world and your great mercy.

****

Of the Martyrs.

It there is any virtue, and if there is any praise, it belongs to the Saints; for they bowed their necks to swords for your sake, who bowed the heavens and came down; they poured out their blood for your sake, who emptied yourself and took the form of a slave; they humbled themselves even to death, imitating your poverty. At their prayers, according to the multitude of your mercies, O God, have mercy on us.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.
O Saints, what shall we call you?**

Those who were found worthy to look on God in bodily form, proclaimed you Bride and Virgin of the Father’s dignity and Godhead, Mother of the Word and God, and dwelling of the Holy Spirit; for in you, Maiden, the whole fullness of the Godhead dwelt in bodily form, when grace was full and perfect.

ON THURSDAY EVENING
-------------------

**AT VESPERS**

****

At

Lord, I have cried*,* **we sing Prosomia of the Cross.
Tone 8. Your Angel, Lord.**

The lawless people condemned you, my Jesu, the Lord and Creator of the whole world, to be crucified between lawless men; and when it saw their shameless deed the whole earth quaked, revealing you, Master, to be the Maker of all things.

We are all redeemed from the curse of the law and from accusations; for the Lord of the law was lifted up on the precious Cross, becoming a source of inexhaustible blessing, grace and mercy for us who hymn his divine sufferings.

When your hands were wounded, Lover of mankind, you healed our wounds; you directed all to ways of salvation, Lord, when your feet were gouged through on the Cross, which when the First-formed man saw them in Paradise, he hid himself.

****

Others of the Mother of God. O marvellous wonder!

Hail Lady, Mother of God; hail sceptre of David; hail heavenly gate; hail bush unburned; hail shaded mountain; hail lampstand; hail all-immaculate; hail jar; hail palace; hail all-unblemished Mother of our God; hail tongs; hail divine table; hail hope of the world.

The waves of my sins, Sovereign Lady, as on a dread ocean, lifted high above my head threaten to drown me; but stretch out your hand to me, as one was once to Peter as he was sinking, and save and guide me to a harbour of repentance, I beg, immaculate, all-praised, Mother of God, hope of all the world.

Fearfully darkened by the passions of sin, I am hastening, wretch that I am, to fall into the precipice of despair; but do you, blessed Lady, full of God’s grace, take pity on me; make the light of your compassion shine for me, and guide me to straight ways, I entreat, I fall down, I beg. Do not despise me.

Glory. Both now.

**Cross*-*Theotokion*.***

When the All-pure saw you, O Christ, willingly hanged on a cross, knowing your power, she was seized with grief and in lamentation cried aloud to you: My Child, do not leave me, who gave you birth; give me a word, my Son; do not pass from your servant in silence, O Word of God.

****

Aposticha of the Cross.

You were lifted up on a Cross, Christ God, and you saved the human race; we glorify your sufferings.

You were fixed on a Cross, Christ God, and you opened the gates of Paradise; we glorify you, our Redeemer.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Martyrs of the Lord, you hallow every place and cure every sickness; and now intercede, we beg, that our souls may be delivered from the snares of the foe.

Glory. Both now.

**Cross-Theotokion. Your Martyrs, Lord.**

As she saw you crucified and put to death, the Mother of God cried: Alas! How do you endure pains, my sweetest Son? The lance strikes my heart, your passion burns my inward parts. But yet I confess you, for willing you suffer all this to save mankind.

ON FRIDAY EVENING
-----------------

**A T VESPERS**

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **Stichera of the Martyrs.**

Martyrs of the Lord; you hallow every place, heal every disease; now too intercede, we beg, that our souls may be delivered from the snares of the foe.

Your Martyrs, Lord, forgetting. the affairs of life and despising torments because of the life to come have been declared its heirs; therefore they rejoice with Angels. At their entreaties grant your people your great mercy.

If there is any virtue, if there is any praise, it befits the saints; for they bowed their necks to the sword for you, who bowed the heavens and came down; they poured out their blood for you, who emptied yourself and took the form of a servant; they were made humble even to death, imitating your poverty; at their prayers, according to the multitude of your pity, 0 God, have mercy on us.

****

Other Stichera, Prosomia. O marvellous wonder!

I have become like a fruitless tree, wearing the holy scheme like empty leaves, and I tremble, Master. Do not cut me off and despatch me into the unquenchable and everlasting fire. But grant me a time for turning back, that I may bring you the fair fruit of virtuous deeds and be counted worthy of your Kingdom.

Lord, Lord, do not cast from your presence me, your servant who each day greatly anger your loving-kindness, Lover of mankind. Do not chastise me, O Christ, in your just wrath. I have sinned, I have sinned against you as no one else. Take pity and save me at the prayers of your Mother.

When you sit upon the throne of judgement in your glory as King of the universe, while your holy Angels stand around you in fear, all human nature will be judged, O Christ. Then, Lord, at the entreaties of your Mother, deliver from all punishments those who have fallen asleep in faith.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

The King of heaven through love for mankind appeared on earth and lived among men; for taking flesh from a pure Virgin and coming forth from her with the addition, he is one Son, double in nature, but not in person; therefore proclaiming him as truly perfect God and perfect man, we confess Christ our God; implore him, Mother without bridegroom, to have mercy on our souls.

****

Aposticha. Of the Martyrs.

Martyrs of the Lord, you hallow every place, heal every disease; now too intercede, we beg, that our souls may be delivered from the snares of the foe.

****

Verse 1:

Blessed are those whom you have chosen and taken, O Lord. ****

Of the Dead.

I grieve and I lament whenever I consider death, and see the beauty that was fashioned for us according to God’s image lying in the tombs without form, without glory, having no shape. O the wonder! What is this mystery that has happened concerning us? How have we been handed over to corruption? Truly it is at God’s command, as it is written, God who grants rest to those who have passed over.

****

Verse 2:

Their souls shall dwell among good things.

Your death, Lord, has become the cause of immortality; for had you not been laid in a tomb, Paradise had not been opened; and so give rest to those who have passed over, as you love mankind.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Pure Virgin, Gate of the Word, Mother of our God, intercede that we may be saved.
