CARNIVAL SUNDAY

ON SATURDAY EVENING

AT VESPERS

****

After the Opening Psalm and the usual reading from the Psalter, at

Lord, I have cried**, we insert ten stichera: six of the Resurrection in the Tone of the week from the Octoichos, and the following four Prosomia from the Triodion.**

Tone 6. Having set all your hope.

When you are about to come to execute just judgement, Judge most just, seated on the throne of your glory, a river of fire will draw all mortals amazed before your judgement-seat; the heavenly Powers will stand beside you, and humankind in fear will be judged according to the deeds that each has done. Then spare us, Christ, in your compassion, with faith we entreat you, and count us worthy of the destiny of the saved.

The books will be opened and the deeds of mortals will be revealed before the unbearable judgement-seat; and the whole valley will echo with the fearful sound of weeping, as it watches all those that sinned, weeping in vain, being sent away by your just judgement to everlasting torments. Therefore we beseech you, compassionate Lord: spare us who sing your praise, for you alone are full of mercy.

Trumpets will sound and tombs will be emptied, and all human nature in trembling will rise up. Those that have done good will rejoice in joy, as they wait to receive their reward; those that have sinned will tremble and bitterly lament, as they are sent to punishment and parted from the chosen. Take pity on us, Lord of glory, in your goodness, and count us worthy of a place with those who have loved you.

I weep and lament when I think of the eternal fire, the outer darkness and the nether world, the dread worm and the gnashing of teeth, and the unceasing anguish that will befall those who have sinned without measure, by their evil intent arousing you to anger, O Supremely Good. Of whom I am first, wretch that I am. But, Judge, in your mercy save me, for you love mankind.

Glory. **Tone 8.**

When the thrones are set up and the books are opened, and God sits in judgement, O what fear there will be then ! When the angels stand with fear in your presence and the river of fire is flowing, what shall we humans, guilty of many sins, do then? When we hear him calling the blessed of his Father into the Kingdom, but sending sinners away to punishment, who will withstand that fearful condemnation? But, Saviour who alone love mankind, King of the ages, before the end comes turn me back through repentance and have mercy on me.

Both now.

****

Then the Theotokion in the Tone of the week from the Octoichos, followed by the Entrance,

** O Joyful Light**, and the Prokeimenon of the day,** ** The Lord is King. ****

Alphabetic Aposticha from the Octoichos.

Glory. **Tone 8.**

Alas, black soul! Till when will you not make an end of evils ? Till when will you lie in idleness? Why do you not think of the fearful hour of death? Why do you not tremble at the dread judgement seat of the Saviour? What defence then will you make, or what will you answer? Your works will be there to condemn you; your deeds will reproach you and condemn you. the time is near at hand, my soul; run, make haste before it is too late, and cry aloud in faith: I have sinned, Lord, I have sinned against you; but I know your compassion, Lover of mankind. Good Shepherd, do not deprive me of a place at your right hand in your great mercy.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Virgin without bridegroom, Mother of God the Most High, who ineffably conceived God in the flesh, accept the supplications of your servants, O all-blameless, for to all you grant cleansing from their faults. Now receive our prayers and intercede that we may all be saved.

****

The Apolytikion

** Virgin Mother of God, hail, Mary full of grace **(three times), and the rest of the Vigil.**
