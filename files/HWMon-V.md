The priest gives the blessing:

Blessed is the Kingdom of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and always, and to ages of ages.

The appointed monk or the Superior reads the Opening Psalm as follows:

Amen. Come let us worship and fall down before the King, our God. Come let us worship and fall down before Christ the King, our God. Come let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King and our God.

Psalm 103

Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you have been greatly magnified. You have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his upper chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind, making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle; waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at the voice of your thunder. The mountains rise and the plains descend to the place which you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await them to quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling: and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human heart. The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There the sparrows will build their nests; the heron’s dwelling is at their head. The high mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night, in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they will lie down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth has been filled with your creation. Also this great, wide sea; there there are creeping things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go to and fro; this dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to you to give them their food in due season. When you give it them, they will gather it. When you open your hand all things will be filled with goodness. But when you turn away your face they will be troubled. You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust. You will send forth your spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of the earth. May the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his works. He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. May my words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no more. Bless the Lord, my soul! ****

And again

The sun knew the hour of its setting: you made darkness, and it was night. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all!

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (**x3)**

After the Litany, the appointed Kathisma of the Psalter is read by one Reader.

KATHISMA EIGHTEEN **Psalm 119 A Song of Ascents.**

When I was afflicted I called to the Lord, and he heard me. O Lord, deliver my soul from unjust lips and from a deceitful tongue. What should be given you, what added to you for a treacherous tongue? The sharpened arrows of the powerful, with the coals of desolation. Alas! For my sojourning has been prolonged, I have camped among the encampments of Kedar. My soul has long been a sojourner. With those who hate peace I was peaceable. When I spoke with them, they made war on me for nothing.

****

Psalm 120 A Song of Ascents.

I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains. From where will my help come? My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. Do not let your foot waver. May the One who guards you not slumber. See, the One who guards Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord will guard you; the Lord is protection for you on your right hand. By day the sun will not scorch you, nor the moon by night. The Lord will guard you from every evil, the Lord will guard your soul. The Lord will guard your coming in, and your going out, from now and for ever more.

****

Psalm 121 A Song of Ascents.

I rejoiced at those who said to me, ‘We shall go to the house of the Lord’. Our feet were standing in your courts, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem built as a city, shared by all together. For there the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord. For there thrones were set for judgement, thrones over the house of David. Ask then for the things which are for Jerusalem’s peace, and prosperity for those who love you. May there be peace then in your power and prosperity in your citadels. For the sake of my brethren and neighbours, I have spoken peace concerning you. For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I have sought good things for you.

****

Psalm 122 A Song of Ascents.

I have lifted my eyes to you who dwell in heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look to their lords’ hands, as the eyes of a maid to her mistress’s hands, so do our eyes to the Lord our God, until he take pity on us. Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us, for we have had our fill of contempt, our soul has been filled to overflowing. Let reproach be for the prosperous, and contempt for the proud.

****

Psalm 123 A Song of Ascents.

If the Lord had not been among us, let Israel now say; if the Lord had not been among us when people rose up against us, they would have swallowed us down alive. When their fury raged against us, the water would have drowned us, our soul would have passed through the torrent, our soul would have passed through irresistible water. Blessed is the Lord, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul was delivered like a sparrow from the snare of the hunters. The snare was shattered, and we were delivered. Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

Psalm 124 A Song of Ascents.

Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Sion. One who dwells in Jerusalem will be shaken for ever. Mountains encircle her, and the Lord encircles his people from now and for ever. For the Lord will not leave the rod of sinners upon the heritage of the just, lest the just stretch out their hands in iniquities. Do good, Lord, to the good and to the upright in heart. But the Lord will drive away with those who work iniquity, those who turn aside to extortions. Peace upon Israel.

****

Psalm 125 A Song of Ascents.

When the Lord turned back the captivity of Sion, we became like those who are comforted. Then our mouth was filled with joy, and our tongue with rejoicing. Then they will say among the nations, ‘The Lord has done great things with them’. The Lord has done great things with us, we have become joyful. Turn back our captivity, O Lord, like streams in the south. Those who sow in tears, will reap in joy. They went, and as they went they wept, while they sowed their seed. But when they come, they will come in joy, carrying their sheaves.

****

Psalm 126 A Song of Ascents.

If the Lord does not build the house, the builders have toiled for nothing. If the Lord does not guard the city, the guard has kept vigil for nothing. Your getting up at dawn is for nothing, your rising after sitting, you that eat the bread of sorrow, when he gives sleep to those he loves, see, sons are the Lord’s inheritance, the reward of the fruit of the womb. As arrows in the hand of a powerful man, so are the sons of the rejected. Blessed is one who satisfies his desire with them. They will not be shamed when they speak with their enemies in the gates.

****

Psalm 127 A Song of Ascents.

Blessed are all who fear the Lord, who walk in his ways. You will eat the toils of your fruits. You are blest, and it will be well with you. Your wife like a luxuriant vine against the sides of your house; your sons like new olive shoots around your table. See, that is how one who fears the Lord will be blessed. The Lord bless you from Sion, and may you see the good things of Jerusalem all the days of your life. And may you see your children’s children. Peace upon Israel.

****

Psalm 128 A Song of Ascents.

Many times they have made war on me since my youth, let Israel now say. Many times they have made war on me since my youth, and yet they have not prevailed over me. The sinners have wrought upon my back, they have prolonged their iniquity. The Lord is just, he has broken the sinners’ necks. Let all those who hate Sion be shamed and turned back. Let them become like grass on the housetops, which withers before it is uprooted. The reaper has not filled his hand with it, nor the one who gathers the sheaves his bosom. Nor have the passers-by said, ‘The Lord’s blessing be on you. We have blessed you in the name of the Lord’.

Psalm 129 A Song of Ascents

Out of the depths I have cried to you, O Lord. Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication. If you note our iniquities, Lord, Lord, who will survive? Because forgiveness is with you. For your name’s sake I have waited for you, O Lord; my soul has waited for your word, my soul has hoped in the Lord. From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch, let Israel hope in the Lord. Because with the Lord there is mercy and with him abundant redemption; and he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

****

Psalm 130 A Song of Ascents

Lord, my heart has not been exalted, nor have my eyes become lofty, I have neither walked among great affairs, nor among marvels beyond me. If I had not been humble-minded, but exalted my soul, like a weaned child towards its mother, so you will requite my soul. Let Israel hope in the Lord, from now and for ever.

****

Psalm 131 A Song of Ascents

Lord remember David and all his meekness, how he swore to the Lord, made a vow to the God of Jacob, ‘I shall not enter the shelter of my house, climb into my bed, I shall not give sleep to my eyes, slumber to my eyelids and rest to my temples, until I find a place for the Lord, a shelter for the God of Jacob’. See, we heard of it in Ephrata, we found it in the woodland fields. We shall enter his tabernacles, we shall worship at the place where his feet have stood. Arise, Lord, into your rest, you and the ark of your sanctification. Your priests will clothe themselves with justice, and your holy ones will rejoice. For David, your servant’s sake, do not turn away the face of your Christ. The Lord has sworn truth to David, and he will not annul it, ‘From the fruit of your womb I shall place on your throne. If your sons keep my covenant and these testimonies of mine which I shall teach them, their sons too will sit on your throne for ever. For the Lord has elected Sion, has chosen her as a dwelling for himself. ‘This is my resting-place for age on age. Here I shall dwell, for I have chosen her. Her door I shall bless abundantly, her poor I shall satisfy with bread. Her priests I shall clothe with salvation, and her holy ones will rejoice with great joy. There I shall make the horn of David flourish. I have prepared a lamp for my Christ. I shall clothe his enemies in shame, my sanctification will flower upon him’.

****

Psalm 132 A Song of Ascents

See how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together; like sweet ointment on the head, which runs down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, which runs down to the hem of his garment; like the dew from Hermon, which runs down upon the mountains of Sion; for there the Lord has commanded the blessing: life for ever more.

****

Psalm 133 A Song of Ascents

Come, now bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. Lift up your hands by night to the Holy Place, and bless the Lord. The Lord bless you from Sion, he who made heaven and earth.

Verse:

Blessed are all who fear the Lord, and walk in his ways.

The Reading is from Exodus. \[

**Exodus 1:1-21**\]

These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob their father, each with all his household: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Juda, Issachar, Zabulon, Benjamin, Dan and Nephtalim, Gad and Aser. Joseph was already in Egypt. The total number of people born to Jacob was seventy-five. Then Joseph died, and all his brothers, and that whole generation. But the Israelites were fruitful and prolific; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them. Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph. He said to his people, ‘Look, the Israelite people are more numerous and more stronger than we are. Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase and, in the event of war, join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.’ Therefore they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with forced labour. They built supply cities, Pitho, Rameses and On, which is Helioupolis, for Pharao. But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and grew stronger, so that the Egyptians came to abominate the Israelites. The Egyptians became ruthless in imposing tasks on the Israelites, and made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and brick and in every kind of field labor. They were ruthless in all the tasks that they imposed on them. The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Sephora and the other Phua, ‘When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women, and they are about to give birth, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, spare her.’ But the midwives feared God; they did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but they let the boys live. So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, ‘Why have you done this, and allowed the boys to live?’ The midwives said to Pharao, ‘Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they give birth before the midwives comes to them.’ So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people multiplied and became very strong.

Reader:

The Reading is from Job. \[

**1:1-12**\]

There was once a man in the land of Ausis whose name was Job. That man was blameless, just and true, one who feared God and turned away from every evil deed. There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she asses in pasture and very many servants, and great works of husbandry on the earth; so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east. His sons used to go and hold feasts in one another’s houses in turn each day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. And when the feast days had run their course, Job would send and purify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer sacrifices according to the number of them all; and a calf for a sin-offering for their souls. For Job said, ‘It may be that my children have thought evil against God in their hearts.’ This is what Job always did. One day the angels of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the devil also came among them. The Lord said to the devil, ‘Where have you come from?’ The devil answered the Lord, ‘From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down under heaven.’ The Lord said to the devil, ‘Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, a man blameless, just and true who fears God and turns away from every evil deed.’ Then the devil answered the Lord, ‘Does Job reverence God for nothing? Have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his cattle have increased in the land. But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will indeed bless you to your face.’ The Lord said to the devil, ‘Very well, all that he has is in your power; only do not touch!’ So the devil went out from the presence of the Lord.

Let my prayer be set forth as incense before you… ****

People:

The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. ****

Then the Prayer of St Ephrem, once.

Priest:

Wisdom. Stand upright. Let us listen to the holy Gospel. ****

Priest:

Peace to all. ****

Reader:

And to your Spirit. ****

Priest:

The reading is from the holy Gospel according to Matthew. ****

Reader:

Glory to you, Lord, glory to you! ****

Priest:

Let us attend.

\[

**24:3-35**\]

At that time, as Jesus was sitting on the mount of Olives, his disciples approached him privately, saying, ‘Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?’ Jesus answered them, ‘See that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ!’ and they will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumours of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for all this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and plagues and earthquakes in various places: all this is but the beginning of woes. Then they will hand you over to affliction and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name. Then many will fall away, and they will betray one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because of the increase of lawlessness, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. And this Gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the inhabited world, as a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come. So when you see the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place, as was spoken of by the prophet Daniel (let the reader understand), then let those in Judea flee to the mountains; the one on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house; the one in the field not turn back to get his clothes. Woe to those who are with child and to those who are nursing infants in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on Sabbath. For at that time there will be great suffering, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. And if those days had not been cut short, no one would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. Then if anyone says to you, ‘See! Here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ — do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will appear and produce great signs and omens, to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. So, if they say to you, ‘See! He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out. See! He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and appears as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever the corpse is, there the eagles will gather. Immediately after the suffering of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven will be shaken. Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. From the fig tree learn the parable: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very doors. Amen I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

First Prayer of the Faithful.

O God, great and to be praised, who by the life-giving death of your Christ, brought us from corruption to incorruption, free all our senses from the death of the passions, setting over them as ruler the reason that is within us. And let our eyes abstain from every evil sight, our hearing be inaccessible to idle words, our tongues cleansed of unseemly speech. Purify our lips that sing your praise you, O Lord, make out hands refrain from base actions and to do only things that are well-pleasing to you, and make our limbs and our minds secure by your grace.

Second Prayer of the Faithful

Master, holy and supremely good, we implore you by your rich mercy to be merciful to us sinners and to make us worth of the reception of your only-begotten Son and our God, the King of glory. For see, his most pure Body and life-giving Blood, entering at this present hour, are about to be placed on this mystical table, invisibly escorted by a multitude of the heavenly army. Grant us to communion of them without condemnation, so that, the eye of our mind being illumined through them, we may become children of light and of the day.

(

**Aloud**) According to the gift of your Christ, with whom you are blessed, together with your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and ever and to the ages of ages. ****

People:

Amen.

Now the hosts of heaven invisibly worship with us; for see, the King of Glory enters. See, the perfected mystical sacrifice is being borne in.

****

After the Entrance, during which all prostrate with their faces to the ground:

With faith and love, let us draw near that we may become partakers of everlasting life. Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

****

Then the Prayer of St Ephrem, once.

Priest:

Let us complete our evening prayer to the Lord.

**People: Lord, have mercy.**

**Priest:** For the precious gifts here set forth and presanctified, let us pray to the Lord. That our God, who loves mankind, having accepted them on his holy, heavenly and spiritual altar, as a sweet-smelling savour of spiritual fragrance would send down upon us his divine grace and the gift of the Holy Spirit, let us pray. For our deliverance from all tribulation, wrath, danger and constraint, let us pray to the Lord. Help us, save, have mercy on us and keep us, O God, by your grace.

That the whole evening may be perfect, holy, peaceful and sinless, let us ask of the Lord.

****

People:

Grant this, O Lord. ****

Priest:

An angel of peace, a faithful guide, a guardian of our souls and bodies, let us ask of the Lord. Pardon and forgiveness of our sins and offences, let us ask of the Lord. Things good and profitable for our souls, and peace for the world, let us ask of the Lord. That we may live out the rest of our days in peace and repentance, let us ask of the Lord. A Christian end to our life, painless, unashamed and peaceful, and a good defence before the dread judgement seat of Christ, let us ask. Having asked for the unity of the faith and the communion of the Holy Spirit, let us entrust ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ, our God.

\[

**The Hieratikon from Simonos Petra gives the usual petition here:**

Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most blessed and glorious Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, with all the Saints, let us entrust ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God.\]

****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

Priest:

God of ineffable and unseen mysteries, with whom are the hidden treasures of wisdom and knowledge, who have revealed the service of this liturgy to us and through your great love for humankind placed us sinners to offer you gifts and sacrifices for our own sins and for those committed in ignorance by the people; do you yourself, invisible King, who do great and unfathomable things, things glorious and marvellous without number, look upon us your unworthy servants, who stand at this your holy altar, as at your cherubic throne, on which, through these dread things here set forth, rests your only-begotten Son and our God. And, having freed us and your faithful people from all uncleanness, make holy the souls and bodies of us all with a holiness that cannot be taken away, so that we, partaking with a pure conscience, a face unashamed and an enlightened heart of these divine Holy Things and being given life by them, may be united to your Christ himself, our true God, who said, ‘One who eats my flesh and rinks my blood abides in me and I in them’. So that, with your Word, Lord, abiding and dwelling in us, we may become temples of your all-holy and venerable Spirit, redeemed from every wile of the devil brought about by deed or word or in thought. And may we obtain the good things promised us with all your saints who have been well-pleasing to you from every age.

(

**Aloud**) And count us worthy, Master, with boldness, and without condemnation, to dare to call upon you, the God of heaven, as Father, and to say ****

The Superior, or the designated monk:

Our Father in heaven, may your name be hallowed, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

Master Almighty, who with wisdom fashioned all creation, who through your ineffable providence and great goodness have brought us to those most holy days for cleansing of souls and bodies, for mastery of passions, for hope of resurrection; who during forty days gave into the hand of your servant Moses the Tables in characters divinely traced, grant us too, O Good One, to fight the good fight, to complete the course of the fast, to keep the faith unchanged, to crush the head of invisible dragons, to be revealed a victors over sin, and without condemnation to attain to the worship of the holy Resurrection.

For blessed and glorified is your all-honoured and majestic name, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

After the prayer behind the Ambo:

Blessed be the name of Lord, from this time forth and for evermore. (

**Prostration**) Blessed be the name of Lord, from this time forth and for evermore. (**Prostration**) Blessed be the name of Lord, from this time forth and for evermore. (**Prostration**)

Glory. Both now.

****

Priest (in front of the Prothesis):

Lord, our God, who have brought to these most holy days and made us partakers of your dread Mysteries, join us to your rational flock and declare us heirs of your Kingdom, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Then, as the Priest distributes the Antidoron,

Psalm 33

I will bless the Lord at all times, his praise shall always be in my mouth. In the Lord my soul will be praised; let the meek hear it and rejoice. Magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. I sought the Lord and he heard me, and he delivered me from all my afflictions. Draw near to him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him from all his afflictions. The angel of the Lord will encamp round those who fear him, and deliver them. Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed the man who hopes in him! Fear the Lord, all you his saints, for there is not want for those who fear him. The rich became have become poor and gone hungry, but those who seek the Lord will not be deprived of any good. Come, my children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Who is there who wants life, who loves to see good days? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking guile. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are on the just, and his ears towards their supplication. The Lord sets his face against those who do evil, to destroy their memory from the earth. The just cried and the Lord heard them, and delivered them from all their afflictions. The Lord is close to those who are broken-hearted, and he will save the humble in spirit. The afflictions of the just are many, but the Lord will deliver them from them all. The Lord guards all their bones; not one of them will be broken. The death of sinners is evil. Those who hate the just will go astray. The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants, and none who hope in him will go astray.

\[

**Psalm 144**

I will exalt you, my God, my King; and I will bless your name for ever and to age on age. Every day I will bless you; and praise your name for ever and to age on age. The Lord is great and highly to be praised; and there is no limit to his greatness. Generation after generation will praise your works; and will declare your power. They will tell of the majesty of the glory of your holiness; and will recount your wonders. They will speak of the power of your dread deeds; and will recount your greatness. They will proclaim the memory of the multitude of your goodness; and rejoice in your justice. The Lord is compassionate and merciful; long-suffering and full of mercy. The Lord is good to all; and his acts of compassion are for all his works. May all your works confess you, Lord; and all your holy ones bless you. They will speak of the glory of your kingdom; and tell of your power. To make known your power and of the glory the majesty of your kingdom to the children of mankind. Your kingdom is a kingdom for all the ages, and your dominion for every generation. The Lord is faithful in all his words, and holy in all his works. The Lord supports all who are falling, and sets upright all who are broken down. The eyes of all hope in you, and you give them their food in due season. You open your hand, and fill every living thing with your good pleasure. The Lord is just in all his ways, and holy in all his works. The Lord is close to those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. He will do the will of those who fear him, and hear their supplication and save them. The Lord guards all who love him, and all sinners he will destroy. My mouth will tell the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and to age on age.

Psalm 144 forms part of the Grace before Meals in monasteries, and therefore strictly it should only be read if the meal follows immediately.

And the Dismissal.

Priest:

May he who comes to his voluntary passion, Christ our true God, through the prayers of his all-pure and holy Mother, by the power of the precious and life-giving Cross, through the protection of the honoured, Bodiless Powers of heaven, through the intercessions of the honoured, glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist, John, of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles, of the holy, glorious and triumphant Martyrs, of our venerable and God-bearing Fathers and Mothers who have shone forth in the ascetic life, of our Father among the Saints Gregory Dialogist, Pope of Rome, of the holy and righteous forebears of God, Joachim and Anna, \[of Saint **N**.

At the Thanksgiving after Holy Communion we say the Apolytikion and Kontakion of St Gregory Dialogist, Pope of Rome.

Tone 3.

Enriched with a watchful mouth, you were revealed as noble herdsman of the divine word, Hierarch Gregory; for you became one who manifested the virtues, showing forth the radiance of justice. Venerable Father, implore Christ God to grant us his great mercy.

Glory.

**Tone 8. To you my Champion.**

Let us fittingly sing the praise of the Dialogist, harp of the Church inspired by God and tongue truly possessed by divine wisdom, for imitating the zeal of the Apostles he followed clearly in their footsteps, as we say to him, Hail, Father Gregory!

Both now.
