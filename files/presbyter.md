Show your servant to be perfect, by being well-pleasing to you in all things, and living in a manner worthy of this great honour of the Priesthood that has been given him by your providential power. Because yours is the might, and yours is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</span>
