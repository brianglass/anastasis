INTRODUCTION

This translation of the Office of Vespers for Sundays and Feasts is intended as a practical edition for use in church, or by groups and individuals who wish to pray using the traditional prayers of the Church. The rubrics are therefore reasonably full, though it is not practical to cover every possible situation that may arise.

The underlying Typikon is that of the Holy Mountain of Athos and in most parishes some curtailment may be called for, such as the omission of the reading of the First Kathisma of the Psalter. On the other hand, the common practice of omitting most of the verses of the Lamp-lighting Psalms is most regrettable and should be avoided if possible.

There are a number of differences in Russian use, but these are mostly minor. For example, before the Prokeimenon the Priest greets the People, as at the Liturgy, and the Prokeimenon itself is a dialogue between the Deacon and Choir, and not between the Canonarch or Reader and the Singers, as in Athonite use. *O Joyful Light* and *Now, Master* are usually sung by the Choir rather than being recited by the Superior. Other differences have more to do with the fact that most Russian churches celebrate a highly abbreviated ‘All-night Vigil’ on Saturday evenings, rather than Vespers only.

Technical jargon has been kept to a minimum, but a few words are explained in a short Glossary at the end. In the text these are underlined. There is as yet no generally agreed practice as to which technical terms should be anglicised and which left in their Greek or Slav dress. As in Church Slavonic, no doubt some words will be retained in their Greek form, e.g. *Kathisma*, while others will in the end be anglicised, e.g. *prostration* for a full *metania.*

The Psalms have been translated from the Septuagint because this has been the Church’s Psalter for nearly two thousand years and the prayers and hymns of the Church are frequently little more than a mosaic of words and phrases from it. The use of any other Psalter obscures or destroys many of these intentional echoes and cross references. Since this is a practical edition scriptural and other references have not been given in footnotes. In the future it may be possible to provide an edition with these, together with a brief commentary.

For completeness, we have included the text of the Ninth Hour, which should immediately precede Vespers.

In an Appendix we note the differences for the celebration of Daily Vespers, since these are not numerous. Another Appendix gives the ending of Vespers on Sundays in Lent. We hope in due course to produce a booklet with the details of Daily Vespers in Lent. As it is easy with modern equipment to produce this separately, we believe it is preferable to do so, rather than have a book where every other paragraph begins ‘But if it is…’.

The text of the Litanies and other hymns and prayers which occur in the Divine Liturgy are taken from the bilingual edition of the Liturgy published with the blessing of the Archbishop of Thyateira and Great Britain.

**VESPERS**

FOR SUNDAYS AND FEASTS
----------------------

**After the Dismissal of the Ninth Hour the Priest and Deacon, having made a metania to the Bishop’s stall, venerated the icons and bowed to the two Choirs, enter the Sanctuary by the side doors. They make three bows to the Holy Table and the Priest kisses the Holy Table and the Gospel.**

Then, vested in the Epitrachelion, he opens the curtain of the Holy Doors and, standing uncovered in front of the Holy Table, gives the blessing as follows:

Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

Then the Superior, or the appointed person, reads the Opening Psalm, one of the ‘Gerontika’, as follows:

Amen.
Come, let us worship and fall down before the King, our God.
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ the King, our God.
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King and our God. ****

Psalm 103

Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you have been greatly magnified. You have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his upper chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind, making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle; waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at the voice of your thunder. The mountains will rise and the plains descend to the place which you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await them to quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling: and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human heart. The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There the sparrows will build their nests; the heron’s dwelling is at their head. The high mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night, in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they will lie down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth was filled with your creation. See, this great, wide sea; there there are creeping things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go to and fro; this dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to you to give them their food in due season. When you give it them, they will gather it. ****

If the Anixantaria are to be sung, the Reader only reads as far as this.

****

When you open your hand all things will be filled with goodness. But when you turn away your face they will be troubled. You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust. You will send forth your spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of the earth. May the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his works. He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. May my words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no more. Bless the Lord, my soul!

****

And again

The sun knew the hour of its setting: you made darkness, and it was night. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all!

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God.

**(x3)**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the Opening Psalm is being read the Priest, bareheaded and standing in front of the Holy Table, says quietly the following Prayers at the Lighting of the Lamps, having first blessed the Deacon’s Sticharion and Orarion as usual.

1st Prayer

**O** Lord, compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy, listen to our prayer and attend to the voice of our supplication. Make for us a sign for good. Guide us in your way, to walk in your truth. Make glad our hearts to fear your holy Name, because you are great and do wondrous things. You alone are God, and there is none like you, O Lord, among gods: powerful in mercy and loving in strength to help and to console and to save all who hope in your holy Name.

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

2nd Prayer

Lord, do not rebuke us in your anger, nor chastise us in your wrath, but deal with us in accordance with your kindness, physician and healer of our souls. Guide us to the harbour of your will. Enlighten the eyes of our hearts to the knowledge of your truth and grant that the rest of the present day and the whole time of our life may be peaceful and without sin, at the prayers of the holy Mother of God and of all the Saints.

For yours is the might and yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

3rd Prayer

Lord our God, remember us, sinners and your unprofitable servants, as we call upon your holy Name, and do not put us to shame from the expectation of your mercy, but graciously grant us, Lord, all the requests that are for salvation, and count us worthy to love and to fear you from our whole heart, and in all things to do your will.

For you, O God, are good and love mankind, and to you we give glory, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

4th Prayer

O Lord, who are praised by the holy Powers with never silent hymns and unceasing songs of glory, fill our mouth with your praise to give majesty to your holy Name, and give us a part and an inheritance with all who fear you in truth and who keep your commandments, at the prayers of the holy Mother of God and of all your Saints.

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

5th Prayer

Lord, Lord, who uphold the universe by your immaculate hand, who are long-suffering towards us all and who repent of evils, remember your acts of compassion and your mercy. Visit us in your loving kindness and grant that for the rest of the present day we may escape the manifold wiles of the evil one, and, by the grace of your All-holy Spirit, keep our life free from assault.

By the mercy and love for mankind of your Only-begotten Son, with whom you are blessed, together with your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

6th Prayer

O **** God, great and wonderful, who order the universe with inexpressible loving-kindness and rich providence; who have granted us also the blessings of this world and brought us near to the promised Kingdom through the blessings that have been bestowed on us already; who have made us turn aside from every evil during that part of the present day which is now over, grant us also to complete what remains without blame in the presence of your holy glory, as we sing your praise, who alone are our God, good and the Lover of mankind.

For you are our God, and to you we give glory, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

7th Prayer

Great and most high God, who alone possess immortality, who dwell in unapproachable light, who fashioned all creation with wisdom, who made the separation between the light and the darkness and who placed the sun to have authority over the day and the moon and the stars to have authority over the night, who have counted us sinners worthy even at this present hour to come into your presence with confession and thanksgiving and to offer you our evening hymn of glory; do you, O Lord who love mankind, direct our prayer like incense before you and accept it as a savour of sweet fragrance. Grant us that the present evening and the coming night may be peaceful, clothe us with weapons of light, deliver us from every night-time fear and from every deed that walks in darkness. And give us sleep, which you have bestowed on us for our rest in our weakness, freed from every fantasy of the devil. Yes, Master of all things, giver of blessings, may we also be filled with compunction on our beds and call to mind your Name in the night, and enlightened by meditation on your commandments may we rise with gladness of soul to give glory to your loving-kindness, as we bring to your compassion supplications and entreaties on behalf of our own sins and those of all your people. At the prayers of the holy Mother of God visit them with mercy.

For you, O God, are good and love mankind, and to you we give glory, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

****

When the Opening Psalm is completed the Priest, in front of the Holy Table, or the Deacon in his usual place outside the Holy Doors, says the:

Litany of Peace

Deacon:

In peace, let us pray to the Lord. ****

People:

****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

Priest:

** For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

People:

Amen. ****

After the Litany, except on the Feasts of the Lord, the appointed Kathisma of the Psalter is read by one Reader.

First Kathisma
--------------

**Psalm 1
Of David. Untitled in the Hebrew.**

Blessed is the man who has not walked in the council of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat on the seat of the pestilent. But his will is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he will meditate day and night. He will be like a tree that has been planted beside streams of water, which will give its fruit in its season, and its leaves will not fall; and whatever he does will prosper. Not so the ungodly, not so: but like the chaff that the wind blows away from the face of the earth. Therefore the ungodly will not rise in judgement, nor sinners in the council of the just. Because the Lord knows the way of the just, but the way of the ungodly will perish.

****

Psalm 2
A Psalm of David.

****

Why were the nations insolent and why did the peoples meditate vain things? The kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were assembled together against the Lord and against his Christ. ‘Let us break through their bonds and cast away their yoke from us.’ He that dwells in heaven will laugh them to scorn and the Lord will mock them. Then he will speak to them in his anger and panic them in his fury. But I was established as king by him, on Sion his holy mountain announcing the Lord’s decree: The Lord said to me, ‘You are my Son. Today I have begotten you. Ask me, and I shall give you nations as your inheritance, and the ends of the earth as your possession. You will shepherd them with an iron rod; like a potter’s vessels you will smash them.’ And now, kings, understand; be corrected, all who judge the earth. Serve the Lord in fear and rejoice in him with trembling. Accept correction, lest the Lord be angry, and you perish from the right way whenever his fury is suddenly kindled. Blessed are all who have put their trust in him.

****

Psalm 3
A Psalm of David,
when he fled from his son Absalom in the wilderness.

****

Lord, why have those who afflict me been multiplied? Many rise up against me. Many say to my soul, ‘There is no salvation for him in his God.’ But you, Lord, are my protector, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. I cried to the Lord with my voice and he heard me from his holy mountain. I lay down and slept; I have been roused, because the Lord will protect me. I shall not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who attack me from every side. Arise, Lord; save me, my God, because you have struck all who are vainly my foes, you have smashed the teeth of sinners. Salvation is the Lord’s, and your blessing is upon your people.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

****

The following should be read by another reader:

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God*.* **(x3)**
Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy.
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

****

The first reader here resumes the reading of the Psalms.

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Psalm 4
To the end. In hymns. A Psalm of David.

****

When I called you heard me, God of my justice, when I was in trouble you set me at large; have pity on me and hear my prayer. Children of men, how long will you be heavy-hearted? Why do you love vanity and seek falsehood? Know too that the Lord has made his Holy One wonderful. The Lord will hear me when I cry to him. Be angry, and do not sin; for what you say in your hearts, feel compunction on your beds. Sacrifice a sacrifice of righteousness and hope in the Lord. Many say: Who will show us good things? The light of your countenance has been signed upon us, O Lord. You have given joy to my heart; from the fruit of their wheat, wine and oil they have been filled. I shall lie down in peace and sleep at once; because you alone, Lord, have made me dwell in hope.

****

Psalm 5
To the end: for her that inherits: a Psalm of David.

****

Give ear to my words, O Lord, understand my cry. Attend to the voice of my supplication, my King and my God; for to you I shall pray, O Lord. In the morning you will hear my voice, in the morning I shall stand before you and you will watch over me, because you are not a God who wills iniquity. One who does evil will not dwell with you, nor will the lawless remain before your eyes. You have hated all who work iniquity; you will destroy all who speak falsehood. The Lord abhors a man of bloodshed and deceit. But I in the multitude of your mercy will enter your house, I will bow down towards your holy temple in fear of you. Lord, guide me in your justice because of my foes, make my way straight before you. Because truth is not in their mouth; their heart is vain. Their throat is a opened tomb, they have deceived with their tongues: judge them, O God. Let them fall through their counsels, cast them out in accordance with the multitude of their impious deeds, because they have provoked you, O Lord. And let all who hope on you be glad in you; they will rejoice forever, and you will dwell in them, and all those who love your name will boast in you, because you will bless the just. O Lord, as with a shield of good pleasure you have crowned us.

****

Psalm 6
To the end. In hymns, for the eighth. A Psalm of David.

****

O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chastise me in your wrath. Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am weak; heal me for my bones have been troubled and my soul exceedingly troubled; but you, Lord, how long? Turn back, O Lord, deliver my soul; save me for your mercy’s sake. For in death no one remembers you, and in Hell who will confess you? I have toiled in my groaning, every night I shall wash my bed and drench my couch with my tears. My eye has been troubled through anger, I have grown old among all my foes. Depart from me all you evil doers, for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. The Lord has heard my supplication, the Lord has accepted my prayer. Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled, let them be turned back and speedily be utterly ashamed.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

****

The following should be read by another reader:

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God*.* **(x3)**
Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy.
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

****

The first reader here resumes the reading of the Psalms.

Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Psalm 7
A Psalm of David, which he sang to the Lord about the words of Chusi the son of Jemeni.

****

O Lord my God I have hoped in you; save me from all those who persecute me and deliver me. Lest he ever seize me soul like a lion, when there is none to deliver me or save me. O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there is injustice in my hands; if I have repaid with evils those who repaid me, let me fall empty before my foes. Let the foe pursue my soul and seize it, trample down my life and make my glory dwell down there in the dust. Arise, Lord, in your anger, be exalted in the furthest boundaries of your foes. Rise up, O Lord my God, by the decree which you commanded, and an assembly of peoples will surround you, and for this return on high. The Lord will judge peoples. Judge me, Lord, according to my justice and according to the innocence that is in me. Let the evil of sinners be brought to an end and you will keep the just straight, O God the searcher of hearts and reins. Just my help from God, who saves the upright of heart. God is a judge, just and strong and patient, not producing anger every day. If you do not return he will burnish his sword, he has drawn and prepared his bow. And on it he has prepared the instruments of death, he has made ready his arrows for those who are burning. Behold he has been in labour with injustice, he has conceived toil and given birth to iniquity. He has dug a pit and scooped it out, and he will fall into the hole which he has made. His toil will return upon his own head and his injustice will come down upon his crown. I will give thanks to the Lord in accordance with his justice and I will sing to the name of the Lord Most High.

****

Psalm 8
To the end; for the wine vats; a Psalm of David.

****

O Lord, our Lord, how wonderful is your name in all the earth! For your majesty is raised up above the heavens. From the mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise, because of your enemies, to destroy the enemy and the avenger. For I will look at the heavens the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars which you fixed. What is man that you remember him? Or a son of man that you visit him? You have made him a little less than the Angels; you have crowned him with glory and honour, and set him over the works of your hands. You have subjected all things under his feet, sheep and all cattle and even all the beasts of the field the birds of the air and the fish of the sea, all that pass through the paths of the sea. O Lord, our Lord, how wonderful is your name in all the earth!

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.
Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God*.*

**(x3)**

In some places the Reader adds:

Lord, our hope, glory to you. ****

Then we begin

Lord, I have cried **in the appropriate tone, while the Deacon censes the Sanctuary and the whole Church. If the Priest has to cense he does so vested in the Phelonion and Epitrachelion. He blesses the incense with the words,**

Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

He censes the holy Table from the four sides and the whole sanctuary. Then coming out by the north door he censes the holy icons (x3), the people and the whole church in the customary manner and returns to the sanctuary by the south door.

Psalm 140

During the Doxastikon or Theotokion, which on Saturday evening is always the first of the Tone, the Priest, vested in the Phelonion, and the Deacon make the Entrance with the censer. The Priest blesses the incense as above. They come out through the north door, the Deacon leading, and stop opposite the Holy Doors. The Deacon says,

Let us pray to the Lord.

****

The Priest bows his head and says, in a low voice, the

Prayer of the Entrance

At evening, at morning and at midday we praise, bless and give thanks, and we pray to you, Master of all things, Lord who love mankind: Direct our prayer before you like incense, and do not incline our hearts to words or thoughts of evil, but deliver us from all that hunt down our souls. For our eyes look to you, O Lord, our Lord, and we have hoped in you.

For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Then the Deacon says,

Master, bless the holy entrance.

****

And the Priest blesses the Entrance with the words:

Blessed is the entrance of your holy ones, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

****

Deacon:

Amen. ****

The Deacon censes the holy icons and the People and waits for the end of the troparion. When it is finished, he raises the censer, making the sign of the Cross, and exclaims:

Wisdom. Stand upright.

****

And they enter the sanctuary through the Holy Doors, the one with the censer censing the holy Table.

And we sing
Thanksgiving at the Lighting of the Lamps
An ancient poem, or, as some say, by the martyr Athenogenes.

O joyful Light of the holy glory of the immortal, heavenly, holy, blessed Father, O Jesus Christ. Now that we have come to the setting of the sun and see the evening light, we sing the praise of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. It is right at all times to hymn you with holy voices, Son of God, giver of life. Therefore the world glorifies you.

****

In Athonite use this hymn is always read as one of the Gerontika, except when a number of Priests take part in the Entrance.

Deacon (facing the People):

** Prokeimenon of the evening. ****

Guard them at every moment, during both the present evening and the approaching night, from every foe, from every hostile operation of the devil and from vain thoughts and evil desires.

APPENDIX 1

****

On Sunday evening in Lent we sing the following Troparia instead of the usual Apolytikion, making a full prostration at each of them, except the last.

Tone 5.

Virgin Mother of God, hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, for you have given birth to the Saviour of our souls.

**(Prostration)**

****

Then three full Prostrations with the Prayer of Saint Ephrem the Syrian once only and then the Dismissal, as above.

The Prayer of Saint Ephrem The Syrian

3 Metanias, then the Psalms.

Psalm 83

How beloved are your dwellings, O Lord of powers; my soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh rejoiced in the living God. For the sparrow has found itself a house, and the dove a nest for herself, where she may place her nestlings: your altars, O Lord of powers, my King and my God. Blessed are those who dwell in your house, they will praise you to ages of ages. Blessed the one whose help is from you; who has placed ascents in his heart, to the valley of weeping, to the place he has set. For the lawgiver will give blessings; they will go from strength to strength, the God of gods will appear in Sion. Lord God of powers hear my prayer, give ear, O God of Jacob. O God our shield see; and look on the face of your Christ. For one day in your courts is far better than thousands. I chose to be cast aside in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners. Lord God of powers, blessed is the one who hopes in you. ****

Psalm 84

You were well pleased with your land, O Lord, you turned away the captivity of Jacob. You forgave your people their iniquities, you covered all their sins. You made all your anger cease, you turned away from the anger of your rage. Turn us back again, O God of our salvation, and turn away your rage from us. Would you be angry with us for ever? Or will you prolong your wrath from generation to generation? O God, when you have turned us back you will make us live, and your people will rejoice in you. Lord, show us your mercy, and grant us your salvation. I will hear what the Lord will say in me; for he will speak peace to his people, to his holy ones, to those who turn their hearts back to him. But his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth have met, righteousness and peace have kissed. Truth has dawned from the earth, and righteousness has leaned down from heaven. For the Lord will give goodness, and our earth will give its fruit. Righteousness will walk before him, and set his steps in the way. ****

Psalm 85

Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear me, for I am poor and needy. Guard my soul, for I am holy; O my God, save your servant who hopes in you. Have mercy on me, Lord, for I shall cry to you all the day; give joy to the soul of your servant, for I have lifted up my soul to you. For you, O Lord, are good and gentle, and full of mercy to all who call on you. Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplication. In the day of my trouble I called to you, for you have heard me. There is none like you among the gods, O Lord; none whose works are as yours. All the nations whom you made will come and bow down before you, O Lord, and glorify your name. For you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God. Guide me, Lord, in your way, and I shall walk in your truth; make my heart glad to fear your name. I shall give you thanks, O Lord, my God, with my whole heart; and I shall glorify your name for ever. For your mercy is great towards me, and you have delivered my soul from the lowest Hell. O God, the lawless rose up against me, and an assembly of mighty ones sought my soul, and did not set you before them. And you, Lord, are pitying and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy and true. Look on me and have mercy on me; give your might to your servant and save the son of your maidservant. Make with me a sign for good, and let those who hate me see it and be shamed; for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me. ****

And again:

Make with me a sign for good, and let those who hate me see it and be shamed; for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit.
Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. **(x3)** ** Lord, have mercy. **(x3)**
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit.

****

Then the Apolytikion of the day. If there are two feasts, the first Apolytikion is said **before** Glory and the second after it.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

O Good One, born of a Virgin for our sakes and who endured crucifixion, who despoiled death by death and as God revealed resurrection, do not despise those whom you fashioned with your own hand; show your love for mankind, O Merciful; accept the Mother of God who bore you, as she intercedes for us, and save, O Saviour, a people in despair.

For your holy name’s sake do not finally reject us, do not annul your covenant, do not take your mercy from us for the sake of Abraham, your beloved, and for the sake of Isaac, your servant, and Israel, your holy one.

Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us.

**(x3)**

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your name’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen

Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed; your kingdom come; your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

****

Priest:

For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. ****

Then the Kontakion of the day. On Sunday the YpakoÃ¯.

Lord, have mercy.

**(x40)**

At every time and at every hour, in heaven and on earth worshipped and glorified, Christ God, long-suffering, great in mercy, great in compassion, loving the just and merciful to sinners, calling all to salvation by the promise of the good things to come; do you, Lord, yourself accept our entreaties at this hour, and direct our lives to your commandments. Sanctify our souls, purify our bodies, correct our thoughts, cleanse our ideas and deliver us from every distress, evil, and pain. Wall us about with your holy Angels, that protected and guided by their host we may reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of your unapproachable glory; for you are blessed to the ages of ages. Amen.

Lord, have mercy.

**(x3)** Glory. Both now. Greater in honour than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word, truly the Mother of God we magnify you. In the name of the Lord, bless, Father. ****

Priest:

** May God take pity on us and bless us, and show the light of his countenance on us and have mercy on us. ****

Then the Superior says this

Prayer of Saint Basil the Great

Master, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, who have long endured our transgressions, and brought us to this hour in which, hanging on the life-giving tree, you showed the good Thief the way into Paradise and destroyed death by death, have mercy also on us sinners and your unworthy servants. For we have sinned and transgressed, and are not worthy to raise our eyes and look on the height of heaven, because we have abandoned the way of your justice and walked in the will of our hearts. But we implore your unbounded goodness: spare us, O Lord, according to the multitude of your mercy, and save us for your holy name’s sake, for our days have been wasted in vanity. Rescue us from the hand of our opponent, forgive us our sins, slay our carnal will, so that we, having put off the old man, may put on the new, and live for you, our Master and Benefactor; and that thus following your precepts we may reach eternal rest, where those who rejoice have their dwelling. For you are the true joy and gladness of those who love you, Christ our God, and to you we give glory, together with your Father who has no beginning, and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

Priest:

** Glory to you, Christ God, our hope. Glory to you. ****

Reader:

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Give the blessing. ****

Priest:

May Christ our true God, at the prayers of his most pure and holy Mother; the intercessions of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles; of Saint **N. \[the patron of the church\]**; of Saint whose memory we keep today, and of all the Saints, have mercy on us and save us, for he is good and loves mankind.

Through the prayers of our holy fathers, Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on us.

****

Reader:

** Amen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

APPENDIX 2
----------

**VESPERS ON ORDINARY DAYS**

On ordinary weekdays Vespers is celebrated as follows:

> -   The Priest reads the seven prayers **outside** the Sanctuary and remains there for the Litany of Peace. He should remain outside the Sanctuary for the whole service, except for the censing of the church.
> -   He enters the Sanctuary at ‘Lord, I have cried’ for the censing of the Church. This is done as usual, but the Priest vests only in the Epitrachelion.
> -   Only six stichera are sung at ‘Lord, I have cried’. Normally 3 from the Paraklitiki and 3 from the Menaion. In this case it is the custom in many places to sing 2 from the first set in the Paraklitiki and 1 from the second. If the Saint of the day has a Doxastikon, then 6 Stichera are sung from the Menaion, the 3 appointed being doubled. In this case the Theotokion is the one from the Menaion.
> -   There is no Entrance, but immediately after the hymn ‘O Joyful Light’ the Priest announces ‘Prokeimenon of the evening’.
> -   The Prokeimenon is followed at once by the prayer ‘Grant, Lord’ and the Litany is displaced until later.
> -   The verses for the Aposticha are the following:

****

From Sunday to Thursday

Verse 1.

To you I lift up my eyes, to you who are enthroned in the heavens. As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master: or as the eyes of a maid toward the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God: until he show us his mercy. ****

Verse 2.

Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we have our fill of derision; our soul has its fill. Mockery for those at ease: and derision for the proud. ****

On Friday.

Verse 1:

** God is wonderful in his Saints. ****

Verse 2:

For the Saints in his land the Lord has done wonders. ****

Verse 3:

Blessed are those whom you have chosen and taken; they will dwell in your courts.

> -   The Litany of Fervent Supplication, omitting the first two petitions, follows the Apolytikion and its Theotokion.

The Dismissal is as follows:

****

On Sunday evening

NOTE ON THE DISMISSAL
---------------------

According to the strict Typikon only Saints who are ‘feasted’, that is those who have at least one doxastikon at Vespers, should be mentioned in the Dismissal. It is **not** the moment to read out all the small print from the Synaxarion. There is much variety in the details of the Dismissal in the various books and traditions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**GENERAL NOTE ON THE CELEBRATION OF VESPERS**

The liturgical books assume that the offices are sung by two choirs, that face each other across the church. Choir A, the right-hand choir, stands on the north side of the church and Choir B, the left -hand choir, on the south. Choir A is that of chief singer, or *Protopsaltes*, and Choir B that of the second singer, or *Lampadarios*. Choir A normally takes the lead. The letters **\[A\]** and **\[B\]** at ‘Lord, I have cried’ indicate this. This means that Choir A sings ‘Glory’ and the first Doxastikon and Choir B ‘Both now’ and the first Theotokion. If there is no special Doxastikon, as will frequently be the case on Saturday evening, Choir A sings ‘Glory’, Choir B ‘Both now’ and Choir A the actual Doxastikon/Theotokion.

For the singing of the Stichera, it is usual for the chief singer in each choir to take the first Sticheron for their side. Normally the senior person on each side is then asked to sing the second and the third may be offered to a visiting priest or distinguished visitor or singer. Any remaining Stichera are then shared among the other people in each choir.

At the Aposticha, Choir **B** sings the Doxastikon. This means that on Saturday evening Choir **B** **** should start the Aposticha, since there are 4 stichera. On Weekdays there are only 3, and so Choir **A** starts the Aposticha. In this way each Choir sings one of the two Doxastika.

In some monasteries the ‘leading’ choir changes at Vespers each Saturday, the cycle beginning at the Matins of Pascha.

The Apolytikia are should be sung in the same way by the two Choirs.

On Sundays and Feasts, the ‘Resurrection’ Theotokion of the Apolytikion is always sung in the Tone of the **immediately preceding** **** Apolytikion. This means that on Saturday evening the Theotokion may not be the one in the Tone of the week.

In the monasteries of the Holy Mountain it is customary for the following dialogue to be added at the end of the Dismissal, before the final ‘Through the prayers…’:

****

\[A\]

Accept, Lord, the supplication of us sinners, and have mercy on us. ****

\[B\]

May your mercy, Lord, be upon us, as we have put our in hope. ****

\[A\]

Eternal your memory, blessed and ever remembered Founders. ****

\[B\]

Eternal your memory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE NINTH HOUR

The Ninth Hour ends one liturgical day and Vespers begins the next. They are therefore normally celebrated together.

On days when Little Vespers is to be celebrated, the Ninth Hour is read immediately before it.

The Ninth Hour should be read in the Narthex, or Liti, if the church has one. If not, it is read in the church, with the Holy Doors and the curtain closed.

If there is no Apolytikion or Kontakion given in the Menaion, then those for the ordinary days of the week are used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Anixantaria.
>
> On major feasts, and especially at All-night Vigils, the closing verses of the Opening Psalm are often sung to a solemn and protracted melody. The verses are ‘farced’ with short hymns of praise, such as ‘Glory to you, Holy One. Glory to you, Lord. Glory to you, heavenly King. Glory to you, O God. Alleluia’. The singers take up the Psalm from the verse that begins ‘When you open’, in Greek *Anixantos sou*, hence the name *Anixantaria.* ****

> Apolytikion.
>
> The hymn that precedes the Dismissal (Greek *Apolysis*)*.* It is the characteristic hymn of the day or the feast, and is often referred to simply as ‘the Troparion of the Day’. It is used at all the offices and at the Liturgy. ****
>
> Aposticha.
>
> The series of hymns and alternating Psalm verses which are sung towards the end of Vespers and daily Matins. In Greek *stichos* means ‘verse’. ****
>
> Artoklasia.
>
> The ceremony of the Blessing of Loaves, or Breaking (Greek *klasis*) of Bread (Greek *artos*), that takes place before the *Apolytikion* at Vespers when there is a Vigil. In many parishes it is nowadays celebrated on important feasts even when there is no Vigil, at Vespers or Matins or even after the Liturgy. The ceremony for such occasions will be found in the bilingual edition of the Divine Liturgy published by the Archdiocese of Thyateira. ****
>
> Canonarch.
>
> ** The monk whose task it is to see that the sin*g*ers sing the correct texts in the correct Tone. He also reads the verses of the Prokeimenon and similar texts ****
>
> Doxastikon.
>
> A hymn sung after the short doxology ‘Glory (Greek ‘doxa’) to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit’. It is normally sung to a slower and more elaborate melody than the preceding hymns. ****
>
> Epitrachelion.
>
> Worn round the neck, which is meaning of the Greek name, it is the Eastern equivalent of the Western *stole*, the chief difference being that it is always joined down the middle, normally with a series of ornamental studs. It is usually broader then the Western *stole.* It is the characteristic priestly vestment, worn only by bishops and priests. A priest should not celebrate any service unless he is wearing it. ****
>
> Gerontika.
>
> A convenient word used to indicate those parts of the office which are traditionally read by the Superior, or Elder (Greek *Geron*, or *Geronta*)*.* If the Superior is not present they are read by the senior monk present. A visiting priest or important visitor is often asked to read them. ****
>
> Kathisma.
>
> One of the twenty sections into which the Psalter is divided for liturgical purposes. The word is also used for the short hymns that are sung after the reading of each *Kathisma* at Matins. The word is a Greek word meaning a *seat*. Each *Kathisma* is divided into three *sections* (Greek *Staseis*)*.* ****
>
> Menaion.
>
> From the Greek word for ‘monthly’. The book containing the services for days of the Month. There are thus twelve volumes of the *Menaia*. For places without a full set of *Menaia* there exists in both Greek and Slavonic a volume containing general offices for each category of Saint called the *General Menaion.* The contents of the Greek and Slavonic *General Menaia* are not quite the same, the Slavonic containing more offices, and texts for a full Vigil for each category of Saint including the Lord and the Mother of God. ****
>
> Metania.
>
> ** A low bow in which the right hand touches the ground. Slavonic *poklon.* Also used for a *prostration.* ****
>
> Orarion.
>
> ** The Deacon’s stole. It is worn on the left shoulder and sometimes taken across diagonally under the right arm and again over the left shoulder. It is also worn crossed on the back by readers and sub-deacons. ****
>
> Phelonion.
>
> The Eastern equivalent of the Western *chasuble.* The rubrics direct that the priest is to *lower the phelonion*, that is to let it fall over his hands, at the moment of the Dismissal. This indicates that the work of the service is over, rather like rolling down one’s sleeves. Russian *phelonia* often have a row of buttons across the chest so that the front of the vestment can be raised or lowered. ****
>
> Prokeimenon.
>
> ** A refrain from a Psalm, sung together with one or more verses from the Psalm, that normally precedes the Readings at Vespers, Matins and the Liturgy. Originally the whole Psalm was sung, hence the *Verse* is normally the first verse of the Psalm. It survives every day at Vespers, even when there are no readings. It is the equivalent of the Western *Gradual.* ****
>
> Sticharion.
>
> A tunic-like vestment, resembling the Western *dalmatic*, when worn by servers, readers, sub-deacons and deacons. That of bishops and priests more closely resembles the *alb*, though it is not necessarily white. ****
>
> Sticheron.
>
> A hymn that precedes or follows a verse, in Greek *stichos*, from the Psalms. At ‘Lord, I have cried’ at Vespers and ‘Let everything that has breath’ ** at Lauds the *stichera* follow the Psalm verses; at the *Aposticha* they precede them. ****
>
> Theotokion
>
> *.* Most series of hymns end with one to the Mother of God, the Theotokos, and so a *Theotokion* commonly follows the second part of the short doxology, ‘Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen’*,* and is normally sung in the same Tone as the preceding Doxastikon*.* On Saturday evening, however, the *Theotokion* at the Entrance is always that of the Tone of the week, regardless of the Tone of the Doxastikon. It is also sung again at Vespers sung on the following Friday. In Russian usage this *Theotokion* is called the *Dogmatic*, whereas in Greek the latter name is used for the corresponding *Theotokion* at Small Vespers. ****
>
> Typikon:
>
> The rules governing the celebration and for combining the different elements of the service. The book containing these rules. ****
>
> Troparion.
>
> Any hymn may be called a Troparion, but the word more commonly indicates the *Apolytikion* of the day or one of the stanzas of a Canon. Plural *Troparia.*
