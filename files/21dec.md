ON THE 21ST OF THE MONTH
========================

Commemoration of the Holy Martyr Juliana of Nikomedia.

AT VESPERS

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **we insert 6 Stichera, and sing Prosomia of the Forefeast.**

Tone 4. You have given us a sign.

This is our God, no other will be reckoned with him, the Prophet cried out in spirit; for he has found every way of knowledge; while after these things he will appear to mortals wearing flesh; for he hastens to be brought to birth of a Virgin, Child of God; he who is by nature unapproachable becoming approachable by me .

Your womb, all-blameless Mother of God, is acknowledged to be a heap of grain of a threshing floor, which carries ineffably, beyond mind and beyond reason a ear of grain untilled; which you bear in a Cave of Bethlehem, and is about to nourish all creation by grace with divine knowledge and to rescue humanity from a famine which destroys the soul.

The unblemished Heifer comes forth to a holy Cave, carrying the fatted Calf, to give him birth in a marvellous manner, to swaddle him as a mortal and lay him in a manger as an infant. Creation celebrates in advance as it harmoniously magnifies the one who has wrought such marvels upon earth.

Glory. Both now.

****

Tone 6.

Sion, keep festival; Jerusalem, be glad; City of Christ God receive the Creator, contained in a Cave and in a Manger; Open to me your gates, and entering by them I shall see swaddled as a babe the one who holds creation in his grasp, whom Angels hymn with unceasing voice, the Lord, the Life-giver, who saves our race.

****

At the Aposticha, Prosomia. Tone 2. O house of Ephratha.

The sayings of all the Prophets are fulfilled; for Christ is born in the city of Bethlehem from the pure Child of God.

****

Verse:

God will come from Theman; and the Holy One from a shady wooded mountain.

Glory of those born of earth, their boast and fame, honoured Bethlehem, divine metropolis, receive your Creator.

****

Verse:

Lord, I heard your report and was afraid; Lord I considered your works and was amazed.

The Word of the Father, through whom the universe came to be, without suffering and without change appears as one substance from two natures.

Glory. Both now.

**Same melody.**

City of Bethlehem, make ready the Cave, the Manger, the swaddling clothes for the Creator; for he is at hand to be brought to birth in you.

****

Apolytikion of the Forefeast. Tone 4.

Bethlehem prepare; Eden is opened for all. Make ready Ephratha, because the tree of life has flowered in the Cave from the Virgin. For her womb has been revealed as the spiritual Paradise in which is the plant of life; eating from it we shall live; we shall not die as Adam. Christ is born to raise up his image which had fallen.

Glory.

****

Apolytikion of the Saint. Tone 4.

O Jesu, your lamb cries aloud: O my Bridegroom, I long for you; and seeking you I struggle, and I am crucified and buried with you in your baptism; and I suffer for your sake, that I may reign with you; and I die for you, that I may live in you; but as a spotless victim now accept one who with longing is slain for you. Through her prayers, as you are merciful, save our souls!

Both now.

Bethlehem prepare; Eden is opened for all. Make ready Ephratha, because the tree of life has flowered in the Cave from the Virgin. For her womb has been revealed as the spiritual Paradise in which is the plant of life; eating from it we shall live; we shall not die as Adam. Christ is born to raise up his image which had fallen.

AT COMPLINE

****

At Compline we sing the following Diode, of which the Acrostic is:

And on Tuesday.

****

Ode 8. Tone 2. Irmos.

‘The three holy Youths for not obeying the tyrannical decree were cast into the furnace, and they confessed God as they sang: Works of the Lord, bless the Lord’.

Let us cast from us the sleep of idleness, and with wakefulness of soul let us sing out to Christ who is brought to birth of a pure Maiden: Works of the Lord, bless the Lord.

Let good action be sufficient for the store house of our soul; that with radiant face we may sing to Christ as he is brought to birth: Works of the Lord, bless the Lord.

Increasing our talent by good works, let us offer them instead of gold and frankincense and myrrh as gifts to Christ who gave them, as he comes to be born of a Maiden, Child of God.

****

Ode 9. Irmos.

‘All-holy Virgin, who contained in your womb the uncontainable God, and bore joy for the world, we hymn you’.

To the understanding Christ has given the command to watch, to those who hope for his coming; for he has come to be born from a Virgin.

At your second coming, O Christ, show me, who honour your coming in the flesh, to be a companion of the your sheep on your right hand.

At your former coming, O Christ, you saved Adam; but at your second, save those who honour your Birth.

AT MATINS

The unapproachable God, through compassion willing to become approachable for me, comes forth in flesh, to be born as man in the city of Bethlehem from a Virgin girl; let us eagerly hasten to receive him as we cry out with fear: Lord, glory to you.

Glory. Both now.

**The same.**

After the 2nd Reading, Kathisma. Tone 3. Awed by the beauty.

A marvellous wonder appears today! For our Saviour is now hastening to be brought to birth for us in the Cave in flesh from the Virgin. Magi will worship him with gifts as a king. Shepherds and Angels with glorify him, with them let us also cry: Glory to him who for us became man.

Glory. Both now.

Ode 1. Tone 4. Irmos.

‘The ancient Israel, after crossing the expanse of the Red Sea on foot dryshod, through Moses’ hands outstretched in the figure of the Cross, destroyed the might of Amalek in the wilderness’.

Rejoice heaven, and earth be glad; for God is with us in flesh, he is being brought to birth from a Virgin girl and wrapped in swaddling clothes; while he looses the bonds of our offences as he is compassionate.

A pure Queen gives birth beyond understanding to the King of all things, who opens the kingdom above to believers and takes away completely the sin which ever reigned wretchedly in us.

Prophetic writings are now proved; for see, Christ whom they foretold appears incarnate in the city of Bethlehem; let us now hasten to celebrate to-day his Nativity beforehand with uprightness of mind.

****

The Virgin hastens to give birth in the Cave to the Fashioner of nature, who beyond nature bears flesh from her according to an ineffable hypostasis, that he may make humanity divine.

Daniel sees you, O Word, as a stone cut from a virgin mountain, levelling the altars of idols by your might; and so in fear we glorify you.

Magi from the East, having journeyed with a star to the King of all, offer you gifts, O Christ, myrrh, gold and incense, amazed at your condescension.

Mary, an unploughed land, carries a lifebearing ear to give birth in the city of Bethlehem to the one who nourishes the souls of all who cry: Holy are you, O Lord.

All you ends of the earth be filled with joy; for the Mother of God has to give birth to the King of the universe, O inexpressible wonder! He who is without beginning begins; he who is without flesh takes flesh. A Cave receives the one who possesses all things. Bethlehem rejoice, and creation dance on this prefestal day.

Glory.

**Of the Saint. Tone 4. Lifted up on the Cross.**

Adorned with divers virtues given by God, decked with the flowers of your honoured martyrdom, wholly fair and blameless you appeared, pure Saint. Therefore your Lord loved your beauty and has now brought you into a most shining bridal chamber, in which you dance, Juliana, with the Martyrs as you magnify Christ.

Both now.

**Forefeast. Tone 4. Come swiftly to help.**

Virgins take the lead at the joy of the Virgin; Mothers give praise to the procession of the Mother of Christ our God; Magi with Angels; the Shepherds with us; for she comes to the city of Bethlehem for the birth of a son, God before the ages, who saves the world from corruption.

****

Forefeast. Ode 4. Irmos.

‘He who sits in glory upon the throne of the Godhead, Jesus, supremely divine, has come on a light cloud, and with his undefiled hand saved those who cry: Glory, O Christ, to your power!’

The holy box of the fragrant myrrh of revered sanctification is coming forth to the city of Bethlehem to empty him out who grants sanctification to all of us who cry: Glory, O Christ, to your power.

Inspired Isaias, as you see that your revered proclamations have become realities, rejoice and dance; for the Virgin without seed has borne the uncontainable in flesh in the Cave of Bethlehem.

Jesus is born in the flesh, and in time the Timeless appears as a babe, abolishing my perennial faults, and by his ineffable poverty he enriches me, who have been impoverished by destructive transgressions.

****

Of the Saint. Theotokion.

Seeing her virginity sealed after childbirth the Mother of God and moved by wonder she cried out: My Child, how is that I now wrap you in swaddling clothes, who wrap the sea in sand.

****

****

Kontakion of the Forefeast. Tone 2.

As we see him who holds the whole earth in his hand wrapped in swaddling clothes in Bethlehem, let us bring prefestal songs to the one who gave him birth; for as a mother she rejoices as she holds in her bosom the Son of God.

****

The Ikos.

The Virgin, holding in her embrace the Son of God, and as she kissed him with a mother’s greetings she exclaimed: In conceiving I knew no seed, and in giving birth I did not undergo corruption, but even after giving birth I am pure as before; and so I venerate, my Child, your great compassion and the ineffable miracle which you have shown me; therefore I too rejoice as i hold in my bosom the Son of God.

Bethlehem, land of Juda, make ready your entrances; for in you the Virgin and Mother of God has now come, to give birth in a Cave as a mortal to my God and Lord.

****

At Lauds we insert 4 Stichera, and we sing Prosomia. Tone 6.

The creative Wisdom now advances; the prophetic clouds part asunder; grace clears the sky; the truth has shone out; shadowy riddles cease; the gate of Eden has been opened; Adam dance; our God who fashioned us is himself willingly fashioned.

Fulfilling the oracles and visions of the Prophets, the Word is brought to birth in flesh and becomes corporeal, and after birth he is laid in a manger of irrational beasts. This is the supreme condescension! This the awesome dispensation! For this we sing: The King of Israel, Christ draws near.

That you may cleanse the poison of corruption and refashion for me the original image, you become incarnate and take suck, and you, who at your behest cause the universe to revolve, are wrapped around in swaddling clothes; O Word, who work wonders, I sing your praise, Angel of the Father’s counsel, through which I am made immortal.

Not leaving the bosom of the Father, you appeared as a mortal; and carried in a Virgin’s arms you summoned from Persia through a star the Magi who worshipped you as sovereign God; with the breath of your lips you destroy the godless rulers of the nations and shepherd your chosen people.

Glory

***.* Same melody.**

The Word, who is consubstantial with the Father, kneaded from pure virgin blood, is fashioned and will grow with the passing of time, and again is born in a Cave. Amazement! But Angels clap their hands, Shepherds sing: the King of Israel, Christ is at hand.

Both now.

Both now. **Same melody.**

The oracles of the Seer Balaam are being fulfilled; for those who gaped at Persian prodigies, made radiant by the shining of an unaccustomed star, recognised by their gifts the unsetting Sun, Christ, embodied in Bethlehem, to be God, sovereign and willingly one dead.

****

At the Aposticha, Prosomia. Tone 2. O house of Ephratha.

The Star shines out already in the Cave; you Shepherds with Angels, you Magi with gifts, get ready to arrive.

****

Verse:

God will come from Theman; and the Holy One from a shady, wooded mountain.

That he may fulfil the sayings of the Prophets, the Lord is born in Bethlehem and opens Eden to Adam’s posterity.

****

Verse:

Lord, I heard your report and was afraid; Lord I considered your works and was amazed.

Anoint with myrrh the holy Manger, Bethlehem; for in you the Master unfurls the beams of his Godhead.

Glory. Both now.

**The same melody.**

Come, let us who are born of earth ceaselessly hymn with one voice the Virgin, Mary, Mother of God, from Christ is brought to birth.

****
