LITURGICAL TEXTS
================

Here you will find texts from our principal service books, Paraklitiki,
Triodion, Pentecostarion, Menaia, Euchologion and Horologion. I shall
also be adding Biblical texts as they used in the services of the
Church, in particular the Readings at Vespers and the Psalms and
Canticles.

The translations are, in the main, based on the Greek books published by
the Apostoliki Diakonia in Athens, which are, for the most part, a
reprint of the editions published by Vartholomaios of Koutloumousiou in
the early nineteenth century, themselves derived almost unchanged from
the long series of printed editions since the sixteenth century. These
are practical editions, not critical ones. The latter are virtually
non-existent, though the new series of Cypriot Menaia and the latest
Holy Week book from Apostoliki Diakonia are making a start.

I have also made use of the early printed texts, published in Venice, of
which Chetham’s Library in Manchester, the oldest free public library in
England, has a particularly fine collection, including the Euchologion
of 1602, which formed the basis of Patriarch Nikon’s reform of the
Russian service books that resulted in the schism of the Old Believers.
