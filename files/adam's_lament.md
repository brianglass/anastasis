# ON ADAM

# ’S LAMENT

## INTRODUCTION

The anonymous Kontakion on Adam’s Lament is one of the earliest we
possess and is probably of the fifth century and pre-dates those of St
Romanos. It is still used in the office of Matins for the Sunday before
Lent, where the Proemium is followed not, as is usual, by the first
stanza of the hymn only, but by four, numbers 1 to 3 and 7. The text in
the Triodion differs in places from that of the critical edition,
notably in the refrain, which is in the first person, ’Have mercy on me
who have fallen’. In the third line of stanza 7 the Triodion has,
’Implore God for the one who has fallen’, which does not scan.

The last four stanzas, which correspond to the word ADAM in the
acrostic, are almost certainly spurious, though they occur in all but
one of the MSS. Stanza 18, which begins, ’Now therefore, Saviour’ forms
a concluding prayer, which is feature of the classic kontakion and the
following stanzas are not really about Adam at all, but are simply a
series of commonplaces of inferior quality.

# **ON ADAM’S LAMENT**

Acrostic:* *On The First-Formed, \[Adam\]

Proemium

Guide of wisdom, giver of prudence, 

   
          Teacher of the foolish and defender of the poor,

  
          Establish, give understanding to my heart, Master;

  
Give me a word, Word of the Father;

  
          For see, my lips I shall not restrain from crying to you:

  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the fallen. 

1

Then Adam sat and wept opposite[\[1\]](#_ftn1)  
          The delight of Paradise beating his eyes with his hands  
          And he said:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

2

As Adam saw  the Angel pushing and shutting  
          The door of God’s garden he groaned aloud  
          And said:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

3

Share in the pain, O Paradise, of your beggared master  
          And with the sound of your leaves implore the creator  
          Not to shut you:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

4

Bend down your trees like living beings and fall before  
          Him who holds the key, that thus you may remain open  
          For one who cries:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

5

I breathe the fragrance   of your beauty   and I melt   as I recall  
          How I delighted there   from the sweet scent  
          Of the flowers:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

6

Now I have learnt   what I suffered,   now I have understood   what
God  
          Said to me in Paradise,   ‘In taking Eve  
          You steal away from me’:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

7

Paradise,   all virtue,   all holiness,   all happiness,  
          Planted because of Adam,   shut because of Eve,  
          How shall I lament for you?  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

8

I am polluted,   I am ruined,   I am enslaved   to my slaves;  
          For reptiles and wild beats,   whom I subjected by fear,  
          Now make me tremble;  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

9

No longer   do the flowers   offer me   pleasure,  
          But thorns and thistles [\[2\]](#_ftn2) the earth raises for
me,  
          Not produce:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

10

The table   without toil   I overthrew   by my own will;  
          And now   in the sweat   of my brow   I eat  
          My bread:[\[3\]](#_ftn3)  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

11

My throat,   which holy   waters   had made sweet,  
          Has become bitter from the multitude   of my groans,  
          As I cry out:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

12

How have I fallen?   Where have I arrived?   From a pedestal   to the
ground;  
          From a divine admonition   to a wretched existence  
          I have been reduced:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

13

Now Satan   rejoices   having stripped me   of my glory;  
          But this gives him no joy;   for see, my God  
          Clothes me:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

14

God himself   pitied me,   clothes   my nakedness;  
          By this he shows me   that he too cares  
          For me, the transgressor:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

15

The clothing   signifies for me   the state   that is to come,  
          For the one who has now clothed me   in a little while wears
me  
          And saves me:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

16

‘Swiftly Adam   you have understood   the wish   of my compassion;  
          Therefore I do not deprive you   of this your hope  
          As you cry:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

17

I do not wish   nor do I will   the death   of the one I fashioned;  
          But having chastened him enough   I will glorify eternally  
          The one who cries:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.’

18

Now therefore, Saviour,   save me also   who seek for you   with
longing;  
          I do not wish to take you in,   but I wish to be taken in by
you[\[4\]](#_ftn4)  
          And to cry to you:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

\[19\][\[5\]](#_ftn5)

\[O incomparable,   all-holy,   all-immaculate   look down  
          From heaven as compassionate   and save me as unworthily  
          I shout:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

\[20\]

Rouse    my mind to   praise,   raise up  
          The one who lies sick in bed,   who unworthily, Saviour,  
          Cries to you:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

\[21\]

Raise up   make firm,   O Lover of mankind,   the one who has now  
          Stumbled as a profligate in life;   draw near me, Saviour,  
          As I cry:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.

\[22\]

Unity, Trinity   undivided   unseparated,   at the prayers  
          Of the Mother of God take pity on me   and overlook the sins  
          Of those who cry:  
                    O Merciful, have mercy on the one who has fallen.\]

[\[1\]](#_ftnref1) Cf. Gen. 3:25 (LXX). The first line of Stanza 1
echoes the LXX text of Genesis 3:24, which reads ’And \[God\] settled
Adam opposite the Paradise of pleasure and set in place the Cherubim’.
This rendering has influenced both the liturgical and the iconographic
traditions. The Hebrew has only one verb, ’And \[God\] settled east of
the garden of Eden the Cherubim’. The Catholic *New American Bible* has
adopted the LXX reading as the correct one.

[\[2\]](#_ftnref2) Cf. Gen. 3:18.

 [\[3\]](#_ftnref3) Cf. Gen. 3:20.

[\[4\]](#_ftnref4) The trope in the second line of Stanza 18 is almost
impossible to translate. The verb I have translated ’take in’ in both
clauses is the same, and means both ’cheat’ and ’steal’.

[\[5\]](#_ftnref5) These stanzas, 19-22, are considered spurious by the
editor, though they are present in all but one
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ms</span>. 18 forms a final
prayer, which is feature of the classic kontakion, and the final
stanzas, which form the word ADAM in the acrostic seem to be an
unnecessary addition. They are not really about Adam at all and greatly
inferior in quality, being simply a collection of commonplaces.
