PSALM 22
========

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">A Psalm of David</span>

**Argument**

The Psalm before us is sung in the person<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> of the nations as they rejoice that the Lord shepherds them. And indeed they expound the sumptuous feast that the One who shepherds them sets before them.

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">The Lord shepherds me</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. Those who are shepherded by him take pride in the Lord.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">On a place of green pasture he has settled me</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. He has settled me in the beauty of a summer meadow, means the meadow of the spirit.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">By the water of rest he has nurtured me</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. Water of rest is to be thought of as that of holy Baptism, which wipes away the burden of sins.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">He has turned my soul back</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. When he had turned my soul back from the captivity of the devil, he guided me towards his commandments from death to life. It means the doctrines of the Gospel.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">Your rod and your staff have comforted me</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. It means Christ himself. And ‘the Lord will send you a rod of power out of Sion’<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. And ‘a glorious rod and a rod of majesty’<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>. The power that corrects is a rod and the help that comes through consolation is a staff.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">You have anointed my head with oil</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. This is the mystical anointing. And your cup inebriates me. Again it means mystical joy.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:blue">And your mercy will pursue me all my days</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. For those who have shared in the things already mentioned will be at all times in God’s mercy; and they will truly dwell in his house.</span>
