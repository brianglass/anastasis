# PSALM 22

A Psalm of David

**Argument**

The Psalm before us is sung in the person[\[1\]](#_ftn1) of the nations
as they rejoice that the Lord shepherds them. And indeed they expound
the sumptuous feast that the One who shepherds them sets before them.

The Lord shepherds me. Those who are shepherded by him take pride in the
Lord.

On a place of green pasture he has settled me. He has settled me in the
beauty of a summer meadow, means the meadow of the spirit.

By the water of rest he has nurtured me. Water of rest is to be thought
of as that of holy Baptism, which wipes away the burden of sins.

He has turned my soul back. When he had turned my soul back from the
captivity of the devil, he guided me towards his commandments from death
to life. It means the doctrines of the Gospel.

Your rod and your staff have comforted me. It means Christ himself. And
‘the Lord will send you a rod of power out of Sion’[\[2\]](#_ftn2).
And ‘a glorious rod and a rod of majesty’[\[3\]](#_ftn3). The power that
corrects is a rod and the help that comes through consolation is a
staff.

You have anointed my head with oil. This is the mystical anointing. And
your cup inebriates me. Again it means mystical joy.

And your mercy will pursue me all my days. For those who have shared in
the things already mentioned will be at all times in God’s mercy; and
they will truly dwell in his house.
