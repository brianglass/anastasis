**Commemoration of the dedication of the of the Holy \[Church of the\] Resurrection of our Christ and Forefeast of the Exaltation of the precious and life-giving Cross; and of the Holy Martyr the Centurion Cornelius.**

AT VESPERS

****

At

Lord I have cried **we insert 6 stichera, and we sing 3 Idiomels of the Dedication and 3 Prosomia of the Saint.**

Of the Dedication. Tone 6.

Dedication is to be honoured, said the old law, and it did well; but the new should rather be honoured through dedication; for islands will be dedicated to God, as Isaias says, which are to be understood as the Churches from the nations, which have now been established and received a stability fixed on God; therefore let us too celebrate spiritually the festival of the present Dedication.

****

The same tone.

Be dedicated anew brethren! And putting off the old man, live in newness of life, placing a bridle on all those things from which death comes. Let us discipline all our members, hating every evil eating of the tree, and so only remembering the old that we may flee it. Thus is mankind renewed, thus the day of the Dedication is honoured.

****

The same tone. By Anatolios.

O Christ, you have set up a tower of strength, your Church; for you have established her on the rock of the faith, and so she remains for ever unshaken, for she has you, who for her sake in these last times without change became man; therefore with thanksgiving we hymn you, saying: You are He who is before the ages and for ever, and is yet our King. Glory to you!

****

Of the Saint. Tone 4.

Christ assented to your good deeds, admirable Cornelius, and to your godly entreaties and sent you a Holy Angel to lead you wholly to the light, and the Prince of the sacred Apostles to renew you, with all your household, by water and the Spirit and to initiate you into greater things by the Spirit’s grace.

Clothed in the anointing of the priesthood you hastened to proclaim the proclamation of salvation to the nations, rooting out the thorns of error, O God-inspired, and by the Spirit planting in souls unerring teaching; and so we gladly call you blest, Cornelius, as an inspired High Priest and unconquered Martyr.

By following you ways of goodness the foolish were declared wise; dying by nature’s law, wise Cornelius, and dwelling in a blest tomb you render it a source of many wonders, healing the weary and driving out the spirits of evil by the Holy Spirit, O God-inspired.

Glory.

**Tone 6. By Monk John.**

As we commemorate the Dedication we glorify you, the giver of hallowing, asking you to hallow the senses of our souls, at the intercession of your glorious Victors, O good and All-powerful.

Both now.

To-day a tree has been revealed; to-day the Hebrew race has been destroyed; to-day, through faithful Kings, the faith is revealed. Adam fell through the tree, but again through a tree demons trembled. Almighty Lord, glory to you!

Entrance, the Prokeimenon of the day and the Readings.

The Reading from the third book of Kingdoms.

\[

**Chap. 10, 22-23. 27-31**\] \[**Chap. 8, 22-23a**\]

Solomon stood before the face of the Lord, in front of the whole Assembly of Israel, and stretched out his hands to heaven and said: Lord God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven above or on earth below. If the highest heaven is not adequate for you, how then this house which I have built in your name? Unless you, Lord, the God of Israel, look upon my supplication, to hear the supplication and the prayer which your servant makes before you this day, that your eyes be open towards this house, of which you have said that your name will be there; to hearken to the prayer which your servant prays at this place day and night. And may you hearken to the supplication of your servant and of your people Israel, whatever they may pray in this place, and may you hearken in the place of your habitation in heaven, and be gracious to them.

The Reading from Proverbs.

\[

**Chap. 3, 19-34**\]

With wisdom God founded the earth; He prepared the heavens with understanding. With his knowledge the deeps were broken open and the clouds poured down dew. My son, keep my counsel and my thought, do not pour them away, that your soul may live and grace be around your neck; and there shall be health for your flesh and safety for your bones; that with confidence you may walk all your ways in peace, and your foot may not stumble. For if you sit down, you shall be unafraid; if you slumber, you shall have sweet sleep; you shall not fear alarm coming upon you, nor the assaults of the impious; for the Lord shall be over all your ways and shall support your feet, so that you are not snared. Do not hold back from doing good to the needy, whenever your hand is able to help. Do not say: Come back again sometime, and Tomorrow I shall give: when you are able, do good, for you do not know what the coming day will bring forth. Do not devise evils for your friend who lives near you and trusts you. Do not quarrel with someone needlessly, lest they devise some evil against you. Do not gain the reproaches of wicked men, nor covet their ways; for every transgressor is unclean before the Lord, he does not take his seat among the just. The Lord’s curse is on the houses of the ungodly, but the dwellings of the just are blessed. The Lord opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.

The Reading from Proverbs.

\[

**Chap. 9,1-11**\]

Wisdom has built herself a house and set up seven pillars. She has slaughtered her beasts, mixed the wine in her mixing bowl and prepared her table. She has sent out her servants, inviting with a loud proclamation to her banquet saying: Whoever is foolish, let him turn in here to me, and to those lacking understanding she said: Come, eat my bread, drink the wine I have mixed for you. Abandon folly and you will live; seek sagacity that you may have life, and correct understanding with knowledge. He who reproves wicked men will receives from them dishonour; he who rebukes the impious will shame himself. For to the impious rebukes are bruises. Do not rebuke the wicked, lest they hate you: rebuke a wise man and he will love you. Give a wise man an opportunity, and he will become wiser; instruct a just man and he will continue to receive. The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord; and the counsel of saints, understanding; knowing the law is the mark of a right mind. For by this means you will live a long time, and years will be added to your life.

****

At the Aposticha, Stichera of the Cross. Tone 5.

Hail, life-bearing Cross, invincible trophy of true religion, door of Paradise, support of the faithful, wall of the Church. Through you corruption has vanished utterly and been destroyed, the power of death has been swallowed up and we raised from earth to heaven. Unconquerable weapon, opponent of demons, glory of Martyrs, true ornament of Ascetics, harbour of salvation, who give to the world his great mercy.

****

Verse:

Exalt the Lord, our God, and bow down before his footstool, for He is holy.

Hail, Cross of the Lord, through whom mankind has been freed from the curse, sign of true joy. By your exaltation, O all-honoured, you cast down the foes; help of our kings, mighty strength of the just, beauty of priests; sealed and delivering from evils; the rod of power, by whom we are shepherded; weapon of peace, whom Angels escort in fear; divine glory of Christ, who grants the world his great mercy.

****

Verse:

God is our from of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.

Hail, guide of the blind, physician of the sick, resurrection of all the dead, who raise us who have fallen into corruption, O precious Cross. Through you corruption has been abolished and incorruption flowered, and we mortals have been made divine and the devil has been utterly cast down. To-day, as we see you raised up in the hands of High Priests, we exalt Him who was exalted in the midst of you, and we worship Him, as we draw richly from Him his great mercy.

Glory.

**Tone 2. By Anatolios.**

As we celebrate the dedication of the all-sacred temple of your Resurrection, we glorify you, O Lord, who hallowed and perfected it by your perfect grace; you delight in the mystic and sacred rites that are performed in it by faithful men; you accept from the hands of your servants unbloody and immaculate sacrifices and in return you give to those who rightly offer them cleansing of sins and your great mercy.

Both now.

**Same Tone.**

A divine treasure hidden in earth, the Cross of the Giver of life was shown in the heavens to the devout King, displaying a spiritual warranty of victory over enemies. Happy in faith and love from the hands of God, he sped towards the height of contemplation with complete zeal and revealed it from the bosom of the earth for the redemption of the world and our salvation.

****

Apolytikion of the Dedication. Tone 4.

You have displayed the loveliness of the holy dwelling of your glory below, O Lord, as you have the beauty of the firmament above. Strengthen it for ever and ever and accept our supplications which are ceaselessly offered you in it, through the prayers of the Mother of God, the life and resurrection of all.

Glory. Both now.

**Of the Cross. Tone 2.**

We bring you in intercession the life-giving Cross of your goodness, O Lord, which you have given to the unworthy. Save the Kings and your city, giving them peace through the Mother of God, O only lover of mankind.

AT THE MORNING OFFICE

****

After the 1st Psalter reading, Kathisma. Tone 4.

Christ has enlightened all things by his presence; he has renewed the world by his divine Spirit; souls are made new; for a house has been dedicated to the glory of the Lord, where too Christ our God makes new the hearts of the faithful for the salvation of mortals.

Glory. Both now.

**The same.**

**After the 2nd Psalter reading, Kathisma. To the same melody.**

O faithful people, the festive day of the Dedication has come to Christ’s chosen flock, and urges us all to be made new and with shining face faithfully to sing from the depths of the heart songs to the Master as deliverer and him who makes us new.

Glory. Both now.

**The same.**

Psalm 50, and the Canons.

Canon of the Forefeast, whose Acrostic is the Alphabet, excluding the Theotokia. By Germanos.

Ode 1. Tone 4. The Irmos.

Lord, born of a Virgin, drown I pray in the deep of dispassion the three parts of my soul; that by the mortification of the body, as on a timbrel, I may sing to you a song of victory.

Rejoice, O heaven, and earth be glad, the all-holy Cross comes forth, hallowing us by grace, as we greet it as source of hallowing and cause of deification for all.

All-holy Cross give us who faithfully worship you the power devoutly to tread the path to heaven, that having avoided the pits of our foes we may become sharers in divine glory.

Through you, all honoured Cross we have become friends of the Creator, with heart and soul we ever embrace you, as we see you set forth, and we are enlightened in mind as we glorify the Word, cause of all things.

****

Theotokion.

City of God, bright, honoured treasure of the king of all which held God, all spotless Mother of God, guard the inheritance which ever praises you and faithfully honours your offspring.

****

Canon of the Dedication. By Monk John.

Ode 1. Tone 4.

Christ, who of old led the chosen Israel by a column through the bath of baptism, on Sion you have planted the Church who cries: Let us sing a song to our God.

Today the visitation of your unapproachable glory has covered heaven, the temple which has been fixed for you on earth, in which we sing in harmony: Let us sing a song to our God.

Not by law is your Church beautified, O Lord, nor by the stretching out of servile hands, but proud in the grace of the Cross she sings to you: Let us sing a new song to our God.

****

Theotokion.

At the Father’s will, from the divine Spirit, you conceived without seed the Son of God, and you bore in the flesh him who came from the Father without mother and for our sakes from you without father.

****

Canon of the Saint, whose Acrostic is:

I sing the fame of your wonders, blessed Martyr. Joseph.

****

Ode 1. Tone 1.

High Priest, blessed by God, enlighten by your prayers those who celebrate this your light-bearing and godly falling asleep, your radiant memory and sacred festival.

Even before your perfect initiation, wise, all-blest Cornelius, you appeared by your alms and prayers to be devoted to the Lord of all and to seek him with uprightness of mind.

You learnt the saving laws of him who united to the flesh through his surpassing goodness, when the Prince of the Apostles initiated you into the wishes of the Master.

****

Theotokion.

You draw the hearts of the faithful to glorify you always, Sovereign Lady, Mother of God, with unceasing desire; for you are declared to be the glory of mortals, for you bore Lord of glory, O Immaculate.

****

Forefeast. Ode 3. The Irmos.

We do not boast in wisdom, power and wealth, but in you, O Christ, the empersonned Wisdom of the Father; for none is holy but you, O Lover of mankind.

O glorified Cross of the Lord, who bear the title of Christ’s glory, we glorify you in faith, glorified and enlightened by your holy embraces.

Advancing with joy, O Faithful, let us draw as from a pure fount everliving streams from the Cross, and saved let us hymn God.

Jesus, who is life, was hanged and died on the tree of the Cross, which we now embrace with faith and so flee the passions, the hosts to death.

****

Theotokion.

Appear and dispel the darkness of my soul, tear up the cords of sin, pure Virgin, save me, you who bore the All-merciful.

****

Of the Dedication.

You have sanctified your Church with the Spirit, O Christ, by anointing her with the oil of your gladness.

The Church, O Christ, which has you as her unshaken foundation, is today crowned with the Cross as with a kingly diadem.

O loving Lord, you have shown today that the tabernacle made with hands is, by your dispensation, the dwelling of your glory which is beyond understanding.

****

Theotokion.

You alone, O Mother of God, have become the agent of supernatural blessings for those on earth; therefore we offer you our ‘Hail!’.

****

Of the Saint.

You received the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit and with your whole house wholly accepted God’s grace from a godly mouth, when the godly Prince of the Apostles with care declared the saving teachings.

By your virtues you were exalted as a lofty cedar, and you offered us sweet-scented fruits: the wealth of your teachings, the grace of your wonders and the operation of your healings, blessed High Priest Cornelius.

Made worthy of the greatest renown, Cornelius, you hastened with the Prince of the Apostles and his companions and proclaimed everywhere the divine proclamation, through which we have been guided to the light and delivered from the darkness of ignorance.

****

Theotokion.

You have become a light-filled dwelling of purity, and you bear the giver of light made flesh, who appeared as a man for our sake through his love for mankind, and abolished corruption, O Incorrupt recalling of mortals.

****

Kathisma of the Dedication. Tone 8.

God displayed the Tent of witness, and Moses set it up on earth, and Solomon dedicated a temple with sacrifices; but we who have taken refuge in faith in the new Jerusalem, let us like David offer a divine song to him who was crucified for us, asking pardon for all in which we have sinned.

****

Kathisma of the Cross. Tone 4. You have appeared today.

Your Cross, O Lord, shining like light dispels the forces of darkness; and makes bright the faithful who sing: The Cross is the boast of the world.

Glory.

**Of the Saint. The same melody.**

The Church from the nations received you as its holy first fruits and you enlightened her by your virtuous deeds, O inspired High Priest Cornelius.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

With faith we shiningly celebrate the Dedication of your house, immaculate, blessed, pure, all-praised Virgin; glad in the hope we have in you, O Mother of God, we beg you to intercede ceaselessly with the Saviour, who was incarnate from you, to save our souls.

****

Forefeast. Ode 4. The Irmos.

Through love of your image, O Merciful, you were nailed to a Cross, and the nations melted away in fear; for you, O Lover of mankind, are my strength and my song.

****

Troparia

The Lord’s Cross, appearing like the sun, is worshipped by faithful men; as we greet it our souls are enlightened.

The Lord God incarnate has appeared, and, raised on the Tree, he enlightens every one who worships him, snatching them from disasters.

O Word of God, grant us pardon and forgiveness of offences, who in faith today worship your precious Cross, which is set forth.

****

Theotokion.

Without emptying his Father’s bosom the Word was laid as an infant in your bosom, O Maid, as he wished to refashion me, who am subject to corruption.

****

Of the Dedication.

The Church is sprinkled not with the slaughter of beasts, but with your precious which came from your lifebearing side, as she fittingly cries: Glory to your power, O Lord.

The tabernacles of the Lord, beloved of those who long to see the glory of your face unveiled, cry out in harmony: Glory to your power, O Lord.

In an image of the anointing of your chosen people, the most precious myron, the Church is anointed today as she receives invisibly the divine grace of the Spirit.

****

Theotokion.

Without wedlock you conceived, O Virgin, and after child-birth you appeared again a virgin; therefore with never silent voices and undoubting faith we cry; ‘Hail!’ to you, Sovereign lady.

****

Of the Saint.

Having received the grace of the Spirit, you came upon the earth like a radiant sun, all-praised Cornelius, scattering the darkness of the folly of idols.

Like a great river, Cornelius, you have flowed over all the surface of the earth, watering it by your divine teachings and drowning the weeds of polytheism.

Having become dead to all the world, all-blest Cornelius, you proclaimed the divine rising of him who died for our sakes to those dead through passions.

****

Theotokion.

Pure Virgin, above nature you have become the pure dwelling of the Father’s Wisdom; through whom we have now been delivered from the wickedness of the cunning one.

****

Forefeast. Ode 5. The Irmos.

Send down you illumination upon us, Lord, loose us from the fog of offences, and grant us your peace.

Strengthen against destructive passions, O precious Cross, us who honour you and greet you, holiest symbol of the holy Passion.

Made bright today in hearts and soul with forms of fair things, let us the faithful advance, and worship the honoured and precious wood of the Cross.

Moses once sweetened the waters of Mara, symbolising with wood you, O precious Cross, through which you let fall drops of sweetness upon mortals.

****

Theotokion.

O all-immaculate Virgin, intercede on our behalf with Christ, who clothed himself in material flesh from your pure blood and refashioned mortals.

****

Of the Dedication.

You of old on Sinai showed to Moses, who saw God, the tabernacle not made with hands, thus delineating, O Christ, your Church.

You, Lord, prepared a tabernacle upon earth; by your power you join the choirs of mortals with the ranks of heaven.

You, Lord, we know to be the fount of life; you, O Holy One, came and preached, O Christ, the gospel of peace to your Church.

****

Theotokion.

You, O Bride of God, we advance as an unbreakable defence against foes; you we have gained as the anchor and hope of our salvation.

****

Of the Saint.

Wholly dedicated to the Almighty, O High Priest, you did not ascribe honour to dumb wooden idols even when constrained by murderous men.

You called upon the unseen, most high God, Cornelius, with earnest entreaty, and greatly marvelled at, you cast down the temple of wooden abominations.

Keeping the command of the Almighty, wise Martyr, you were kept in prison and submitted to bonds; and being bound you destroyed the senseless followers of wicked faith.

****

Theotokion.

Bedew me, All-pure, with forgiveness of faults, visit me, who am weak and storm tossed by the troubles of life and the passions of the body.

****

Forefeast. Ode 6. The Irmos.

I have come to the depths of the sea, and a storm of many sins has drowned me; but as God lead my life back from corruption, as you love mankind.

As he hung on you, O Cross, the Creator was willingly pierced in the side and poured out blood and water, through which we who greet you with faith have been refashioned.

Life-endowed wood of the Cross, fount of immortality, redemption of the whole world, save us who greet you as our saving protection.

You have been given to us as an unbreakable weapon, through which we may overcome all the ambuscades of the adversaries, O divine Cross, we who reverently greet you in uprightness of soul.

****

Theotokion.

You were named the holy temple of him who rests in the Holy Place, O Mother of God; therefore you hallow us all who in faith hymn you, O Virgin-mother.

Of the Dedication.

Christ, the King, has now desired the beauty of the holy Church, and has shown her to the mother of the nations, adopted as sons from slavery through the Spirit.

The ranks of evil demons tremble before the Church of Christ, signed with mark of the Cross, and shaded by the hallowing brightness of the Spirit.

The Church from the nations, not with sand but with Christ as her foundation, is crowned with the unapproachable beauty, and adorned with the diadem of the Kingdom.

****

Theotokion.

O wonder, newer than all wonders! For a Virgin who has not known man has conceived in the womb him who controls all things, and has not been straitened.

****

Of the Saint.

As you purely made your prayers, you saw before you an Angel of God, who initiated you into the better things which hold salvation.

Illumined by the Spirit, High Priest Cornelius, you became a star blazing with light, bringing light by the blaze of your light to the ends of the earth.

Blest Martyr, of old darkened by error, you rejected it by your entreaty, acknowledged the Lord and your whole household received God’s cleansing.

****

Theotokion.

The Lord of glory was alone incarnate from your maiden blood, as he purposed to save us, O all-pure, by his goodness.

****

Kontakion of the Dedication. Tone 4. You have appeared today.

****

The Ikos.

When the Word had come to dwell among us in the flesh, the offspring of the thunder wrote of him as follows: Radiantly we have seen in grace and truth the glory which the Son had with the Father. To as many of us as have received him in faith, he has given them all power to become children of God, who are born again, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, but brought to full growth of the Holy Spirit we have erected this house of prayer, and we cry out: Establish this house, O Lord.

Jacob of old in blessing the children, foreshadowed you, O precious Cross; but we who now worship you, ever draw illumination.

Godly Moses with a rod prefigured you of old, O Cross, when he divided the sea; but we who now worship you, pass dryshod through the rough sea of passions.

****

Of the Saint.

You have become the first fruit of the nations, Cornelius, for you were the first to receive holy baptism and the grace of the Spirit, as before you the inspired Apostles.

Mighty wonders you performed by God’s grace; you caught for the faith those who before thought wrongly and taught them to sing: O God, blessed are you.

Hidden in the earth and covered by a bush, by your godly precepts, wise Martyr, you have been manifested, pouring out the grace of wonders and dispelling diseases.

You have been shown, Cornelius, to be a harp sweetly singing saving teachings, and delighting the souls of all, as you sing: O God, blessed are you.

High on a tree Moses raised the serpent, as it is written, depicting you in advance, O honoured Tree, through which we are delivered from the harm of spiritual serpents.

With uprightness of mind you sought with all your soul only the God who had appeared upon earth; therefore, inspired Martyr, you became the precious first fruits of the nations and the vessel of the Spirit.

With the coal of your words of fire, blest Martyr, you burnt up the matter of folly; therefore you have passed over to the light that knows no evening and shed your rays on all those who hymn you with love.

Hung upon you, O Cross of the Lord, Christ truly raised the world fallen into the pit of destruction; therefore with longing we now worship, honour and glorify you.

Let us purify our souls and hearts with enduring works of good deeds, and seeing the saving wood of the Cross set forth in the midst, let us with godly thoughts worship it with faith and longing.

Like a great sun with your rays you shine on those in darkness, and scorch the demons, O fairest Cross; therefore enlighten all who worship you in faith.

The whole Church celebrates a sacred festival in your honoured memory, herald of Christ, for you appeared of equal rank with the Holy Disciples, for like them you inherited the Holy Spirit.

As a priest you were adorned with the doctrines of true religion; you became like the divine ministers of God; but, blest and most holy, you are ever a source of streams of healing, as you bring the diseases of men to an end.

Robed in a garment of salvation, which Christ wove by being incarnate, you now in joy traverse the kingdom above and see clearly the inconceivable beauty of the Bridegroom, admirable Martyr.

Your precious grave, like a spring, pours out healing for the faithful in abundance, Cornelius, it frightens away the evil spirits and gives light to the eyes of all those who praise you with faith.

The Lord and God, willingly incarnate has worked salvation through the Cross in the midst of the earth for the renewal of the world; laid in a grave, he rose on the third day, and as an earnest of life, he shows forth his rising, whose dedication we celebrate in faith with the Angels of God.

****

Theotokion. To the same melody.

With gladness we cry ‘Hail’ to you, O Virgin; hail Adam’s redemption and Eve’s; hail through whom mortal nature has been exalted to the glory beyond the world of your Son and God; hail through whom he is ever worshipped in heaven by Angels, O all-praised Mary, Mother of God.

At Lauds we insert 6 Verses and we sing the following Prosomia. Tone 4.

Today the divine, sacred, honoured and light-bearing house of the resurrection of Christ is shiningly dedicated; and the divine tomb distributes life to the world and furnishes an immortal fount; it gushes forth streams of grace; bursts forth rivers of wonders; grants healings to those who hymn it with faith.

The brilliant, shining beam has blazed from on high and enlightens all things; faithfully then let us all honour the Resurrection of Christ the Creator, and let us feast with hymns and celebrate with psalms the life-bearing divine festival of the sacred Dedication, that we find the Saviour and Lord full of mercy.

Bidden to contemplate the holy sceptre of the Cross exalted in the midst of the earth, let us purify our souls, make our minds shine, let us be made bright with light, and gleaming with divine power let us hymn Christ, who grants hallowing through the honoured wood to those who honour him in faith and devoutly sing him.

Other Idiomel Verses. Tone 1. By Monk John.

Be renewed, be dedicated, O new Jerusalem; for the glory and light of the Lord have risen upon you. For the Father has built this house; the Son has established this house; the Holy Spirit has renewed this house, the Spirit which enlightens and strengthens and hallows our souls.

****

The same tone. By Anatolios.

Of old when Solomon dedicated the temple he offered you, Lord, sacrifices and holocausts of irrational beasts; but when you were well-pleased, O Saviour, to put an end to types and to make known the truth, he offers to your glory unbloody sacrifices, the ends of the world; for you are Master of all things and you hallow all things by the Holy Spirit.

****

Tone 4. By Monk John.

Today the Church from the nations is dedicated by the precious and life-flowing blood from the pure and immaculate side of him who took flesh from the Holy Virgin, Christ our God; therefore let the assembled choirs of us the faithful glorify the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, the one Godhead which governs the whole universe.

Glory.

**Tone 3.**

Come back to yourself, O mortal; become new instead of old; feast the rededication of your soul. Now is the time: let your way of life be renewed. The ancient things have passed away; lo, all things have become new. Bear this fruit for the feast: making the change to a fair change. In this way is mankind renewed, in this way the day of Dedication honoured.

Both now. The same Tone.

**By Monk John.**

Christ, our God, you accepted your voluntary crucifixion for the general resurrection of the human race, and by the reed of the Cross you stained your own fingers with streams of scarlet dye, in your love for mankind signing our remission like a king. Do not despise us in our danger, nor our repeated separation from you; but take pity, O only long-suffering, on your people in distress; and arise, make war on those who war against us, as you alone are all-powerful.
