Glory. Both now. <span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Theotokion.</span>

Come, believers, having gained Mary the Mother of God as an unbreachable wall, let us fall down before her, for she has freedom to speak with the One who was born from her, to intercede and to save our souls from wrath and death.

As good soldiers, believing with one accord, not trembling before the threats of tyrants, you fervently drew near to Christ, O Saints, having taken up the precious Cross, and having finished your course,<a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a> you received victory from heaven. Glory to him who gave you strength; glory to him who crowned you; glory to him who through you grants healings to all.

John, leaping in his mother’s womb, by grace recognised God being carried in your womb, pure Virgin, and faithfully worshipped.<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> But I implore you, O Virgin, with the Forerunner, entreat the Word, to whom you gave a body, that your servant may be saved.

On the other hand, although the word ‘Abyss’ is used positively of ‘the abyss of God’s wisdom‘, it does not seem to be used as an image of Christ. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref53" id="_ftn53">[53]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. Isaias 57:15, ‘\[t\]he Lord Most High, resting in the holies’. The Greek is probably neuter and means ‘in the holy place’ (cf. Psalm 133:2), but it could also be masculine and mean ‘among the saints’. The poet here deliberately plays on this ambiguity.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref54" id="_ftn54">[54]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. Matt. 11:11-15.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref55" id="_ftn55">[55]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. Matt. 7:13-14, though in the Gospel it the ‘gate’ that is ‘narrow’, the word used here. The ‘road’ is ‘constricted’.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref56" id="_ftn56">[56]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. Pss. 17:20, 117:5, 118:45.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref57" id="_ftn57">[57]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Ps. 50:12.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref58" id="_ftn58">[58]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. Genesis 3:1-7.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref59" id="_ftn59">[59]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. the Nicene Creed. The poet, like the Creed, uses the present participle, ‘is coming’, not a future. The Latin uses the future ‘will come’, and this has influenced most, but not all, English versions of the Creed.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref60" id="_ftn60">[60]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> ‘Gehenna’ occurs in the Bible twelve times, ten of them in St Matthew, who uses the expression ‘Gehenna of fire’ (5:22, 18:19. James 3:6 also speaks of the tongue being ‘set on fire by Gehenna’), rather than the one used here.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref61" id="_ftn61">[61]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. Matthew 25:41</span>

<a href="#_ftnref62" id="_ftn62">[62]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. Song of Songs 2:1.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref63" id="_ftn63">[63]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> This title for God, which is found in the Fathers and the liturgical texts, has its origin in Genesis 2:2, where the cognate verb is used, ‘and the Lord God planted a paradise in Edem’.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref64" id="_ftn64">[64]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Isaias 9:5. The original LXX has only this title, the others were added later, to bring the Greek into line with the Hebrew. There is no ‘Angel’ in Hebrew.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref65" id="_ftn65">[65]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. Mat. 8:12.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref66" id="_ftn66">[66]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Mat. 8:12.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref67" id="_ftn67">[67]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Mark 9:48.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref68" id="_ftn68">[68]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. in particular Isaias 19:1.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref69" id="_ftn69">[69]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. Psalm 71:16, Judges 6:37-40.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref70" id="_ftn70">[70]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. Luke 18:9-14, 7:36-50, 23:39-43, 15:11-32, Matthew 15:21-28. It is interesting to notice that four of these five well known characters are found only in St Luke’s Gospel.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref71" id="_ftn71">[71]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The allusions to the rising sun in this and the preceding troparion refer to Luke 1:78-9, the Canticle of Zachary forming the second part of the 9th biblical Ode.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref72" id="_ftn72">[72]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Cf. Ezekiel 1.</span>

<span id="_ftn73">\[73\]</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Matthew 20:1-16.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref74" id="_ftn74">[74]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Exodus 3:1-6.</span>
