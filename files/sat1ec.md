**PARAKLITIKI**

PERIOD OF TONE 1

****

ON SATURDAY EVENING

AT SMALL VESPERS
----------------

**At** Lord, I have cried… **we insert 4 Stichera, and sing 3 Resurrection Stichera from the Oktoichos, doubling the 1st.** Glory…, Both now… **and the following Theotokion, the Dogmatic.**

Tone 1

A virgin festival today, my brethren! Let creation leap for joy, let humanity dance, for the holy Mother of God has called us together, the unsullied treasure of virginity, the rational Paradise of the second Adam, the workshop of the union of the two natures, the festival of the saving transaction, the bridal chamber in which the Word wedded the flesh, the truly light cloud which carried with a body the One who rides upon the Cherubim. At her intercessions, Christ God, save our souls.

****

Then

O Joyful Light **and the Prokeimenon** The Lord is King **with its verses. After** Grant, Lord **etc., we sing the first Resurrection Sticheron of the Aposticha and the following Prosomia of the Mother of God.**

Joy of the heavenly hosts.

Verse:

I shall remember your name in every generation and generation.

You have been glorified in generations of generations, Maiden, virgin mother, Mary, Mother of God, protection of the world, who gave birth in the flesh to the Son of the Father who has no beginning; the Son who is truly co-eternal with the Spirit. Implore him that we may be saved.

****

Verse:

Listen, daughter, and see, and incline your ear; and forget your people and your father’s house.

We who are held fast by unlooked for afflictions and have gained you as our only protection, pure Virgin, cry aloud to you with thanksgiving: Save us, all-holy Bride of God; for you are the refuge of the world and the assistance of our race.

****

Verse:

The rich among the people of the land will entreat your favour.

The world has been renewed by your childbearing, most pure Maiden who bore God, salvation of the faithful and unsleeping protector of those who devoutly ask you: Do not cease to intercede insistently for all those who sing your praise.

Glory. Both now.

**Dogmatic.**

O Virgin, the Prophet named you Cloud of eternal light, for the Word of the Father, Christ our God, descending from you like rain upon a fleece and dawning from you, has enlightened the world and destroyed error. Do not cease to intercede insistently we pray, all-holy Lady, for us who acknowledge you to be true Mother of God.

Now Master,

**Trisagion etc. and the Resurrection Apolytikion.**

And the Dismissal.

AT GREAT VESPERS

****

After the Opening Psalm and the first Kathisma of the Psalter, at

Lord I have cried, **we insert 10 Stichera, and we sing 7 Resurrection Stichera and 3 of the Saint of the day, or 4 and 6 if the Saint is ‘feasted’.**

Resurrection Stichera of the Oktoichos. Tone 1.

Receive our evening prayers, O Holy Lord, and grant us forgiveness of sins; because you alone made known the Resurrection in the world.

Go around Sion, you peoples, and encompass her, and give glory in her to him who rose from the dead; for he is our God, who has redeemed us from our iniquities.

Come you peoples, let us hymn and worship Christ as we glorify his Resurrection from the dead: because he is our God, who has redeemed us from the error of the foe.

****

Other Stichera, by Anatolios.

Rejoice, you heavens! Sound the trumpet foundations of the earth! Shout aloud your joy, you mountains! For see, Emmanuel has nailed our sins to the Cross, and he who gives life, has slain death and raised up Adam, as he loves mankind.

Let us sing the praise of him who was willingly crucified in the flesh for our sakes, suffered and was buried and rose from the dead, as we say: Establish your Church in right belief, O Christ, and give peace to our life, as you are good and love mankind.

As we the unworthy stand at your tomb which received life, we offer a hymn of glory to your ineffable compassion, Christ our God; because you accepted Cross and death, O sinless one, that you might give resurrection to the world, as you love mankind.

Let us sing the praise of the Word, without beginning and co-eternal, with the Father, who came forth ineffably from a virgin womb, willingly accepted Cross and Death for us and rose in glory, as we say: Giver of life, Lord, glory to you, the Saviour of our souls.

Glory. (

**From the Menaion**)

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Let us hymn the whole world’s glory, engendered from mankind and who gave birth to the Master, the Gate of heaven, Mary the Virgin, the song of the Bodiless Powers and adornment of the faithful; for she has been proclaimed Heaven and Temple of the Godhead. She by destroying the middle wall of enmity has brought peace instead and thrown open the King’s palace. Therefore, holding fast to her as anchor of the faith, we have as champion the Lord born from her. Take courage therefore, take courage, people of God; for he will make war on the foe as All-powerful.

****

After the Entrance and

O Joyful Light, **the designated Monk makes a metania to the Superior and sings the Prokeimenon of the day.**

The Lord is King: \* he has robed himself in majesty

****

Verse 1:

The Lord has robed and girded himself with power. ****

Verse 2:

He has made the world firm; it will not be shaken. ****

Then the usual Litany,

Grant Lord **etc. and after the Ekphonesis we sing the idiomel Sticheron of the Saint of the Monastery as we process into the Narthex. After the usual prayers we return to the Church singing the**

Resurrection Stichera of the Aposticha.
Tone 1.

By your Passion, O Christ, we have been freed from passions, and by your Resurrection we have been delivered from corruption. Lord, glory to you.

****

Other, alphabetical, Stichera.

Verse 1:

The Lord is King: he has robed himself in majesty. The Lord has robed and girded himself with power.

All creation, let it rejoice, let the heavens be glad, let the nations clap their hands with gladness; for Christ our Saviour has nailed our sins to the Cross and by slaying death has granted us life, raising all Adam’s fallen race, as he loves mankind.

****

Verse 2:

He has made the world firm; it will not be shaken.

Being King of heaven and earth, O Incomprehensible, you were crucified willingly through love for mankind; when Hades met you he was embittered, and the souls of righteous receiving you rejoiced, while Adam, seeing you his Creator in the infernal regions, arose. O the marvel! How did the life of all taste death? Except that he wished to enlighten the world, which cries out and says: You who rose from the dead, Lord glory to you!

****

Verse 3:

Holiness befits your house, O Lord, to length of days.

Carrying sweet spices the myrrhbearing women reached your tomb with haste and with lamentation; and not finding your most pure Body, but learning from the Angel the new and marvellous wonder, they said to the Apostles: The Lord has risen, granting the world his great mercy.

Glory

**of the Saint, if one is ‘feasted’; otherwise**

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

See, Isaias’ prophecy has been fulfilled; for as a Virgin you gave birth and after bearing child remained as before bearing child. For it was God who was born, therefore nature also is made new. But, Mother of God, do not despise the supplications of your servants, offered to you in your temple; but since you carry the Compassionate in your embrace, take pity on your servants, and intercede that our souls be saved.

****

Resurrection Apolytikion.

When the stone had been sealed by the Jews, and while soldiers were guarding your spotless Body, you rose, O Saviour, on the third day, giving life to the world; and therefore the heavenly Powers cried out to you, Giver of life: Glory to your Resurrection, O Christ, glory to your Kingdom, glory to your Dispensation, only lover of mankind.

****

Theotokion.

When Gabriel addressed you, O Virgin, with his ‘Hail’, as he spoke the Master of all things became incarnate in you the holy Ark, as righteous David sang. You were proclaimed wider than the heavens, for you carried your Creator. Glory to him who dwelt in you, glory to him who came forth from you, glory to him who has set us free through your bearing child.

****

And the rest of the Office of the Vigil.
