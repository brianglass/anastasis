LESSER HOURS

<span style="text-transform: uppercase">first hour</span>

****

The First Hour being joined to the Morning Office, begins straight away with:

O Come, let us worship and fall down before the King, our God.
O Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ, the King, our God.
O Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King, our God. ****

Three Metanias and the Psalms:

****

Psalm 5

Give ear to my words, O Lord, understand my cry. Attend to the voice of my supplication, my King and my God; for to you I shall pray, O Lord. In the morning you will hear my voice. In the morning I shall stand before you, and you will watch over me; because you are not a God who wants iniquity. The evildoer will not dwell with you, nor will the lawless remain before your eyes. You have hated all those who work iniquity; you will destroy all those who speak lies. The Lord abhors a man of bloodshed and deceit. But I, in the abundance of your mercy, will enter your house, I will worship towards your holy temple in fear of you. Guide me, Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies, direct my way before you. Because there is no truth in their mouths; their heart is vain. Their throat is an open tomb, they deceive with their tongues. Judge them, O God. Let them fall through their counsels; according to the multitude of their impieties cast them out, for they have embittered you, O Lord. And may all those who hope in you be glad; they will rejoice for ever, and you will dwell among them, and all those who love your name will boast in you. Because you will bless the righteous; you have crowned him, O Lord, with your good pleasure. ****

Psalm 89
Lord, you have been our refuge from one generation to another. Before the mountains came into being or the earth and the world were formed, from age to age you are. Do not turn mankind back to humiliation, and you said: Turn back, children of men. Because a thousand years in your eyes, Lord, are like a day, or like yesterday which has passed, and like a watch in the night. Their years will be mere trifles, in the morning like grass may he pass away. In the morning let him flower and pass away; in the evening let him fall, dry up and wither. Because we have perished in your anger, and in your wrath we have been dismayed. You have set our iniquities before you; our age in the light of your countenance. Because all our days have perished, and in your anger we have perished; our years were reckoned like a spider. The days of our years there are seventy years in them, but if we are strong, eighty, and the majority of them are labour and toil; because weakness has come over us and we shall be chastened. Who knows the might of your anger? And can gauge your wrath from fear of you? So make your right hand known to me, and those chastened in heart by wisdom. Turn back, O Lord, how long? And be entreated for your servants. We have filled in the morning with your mercy, O Lord, and we have rejoiced and been glad. In all our days let be glad; in return for the days when you humbled us, the years when we saw evils. And look upon your servants and upon the work of your hands and guide your children. And let the brightness of the Lord be upon us, and direct the works of our hands for us, and direct the work of our hand.

****

Psalm 100
I will sing to you of mercy and judgement, O Lord, I will chant and think on a blameless way: when will you come to me? I have walked in the midst of my house in the innocence of my heart. I have set no lawless deed before my eyes; I have hated those who commit transgressions. No twisted heart has been attached to me; the evil man who avoids me I have not acknowledged. The man who secretly slanders his neighbour, him I have driven out. With a man of proud looks and insatiate heart, I have not eaten. My eyes are upon the faithful in the land, for them to dwell with me; the man who walks on a blameless way, he has ministered to me. The man who acts proudly has not dwelt in my house; the man who speaks calumnies has not prospered before me. Morning by morning I slew all the sinners in the land, to purge from the Lord’s city all workers of iniquity.

Glory. Both now. Alleluia

**(x3)**. Lord, have mercy **(x3)**. ****

And if

The Lord is God **was sung, we say:** Glory, **the Apolytikion of the day, then** ** Both now, **and the Theotokion:
**What shall we call you, O Full of grace? Heaven? For you made the Sun of righteousness to dawn. Paradise? For you made the flower of incorruption blossom. Virgin? For you remained incorrupt. Pure Mother? For you held in your holy embrace a Son who is the God of all. Implore him that our souls may be saved. ****

And immediately:

Direct my steps according to your word, and let no iniquity lord it over me.
Deliver me from the slander of men, and I shall keep your commandments.
Let your face shine on your servant, and teach me your statutes.
Let my mouth be filled with your praise, O Lord, that I may hymn your glory, all day long your splendour.

****

Then:

Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us.

**(x3)
**Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your name’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen
Our Father in heaven, may your name be hallowed; your kingdom come; your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. ****

Priest:

For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. ****

The Kontakion of the Saint, if there is one, or of the current Feast, or of the day of the week. But on Sunday we say the Hypakoï of the Tone.

Then:

** Lord, have mercy **(x40)**.

At every time and at every hour, in heaven and on earth worshipped and glorified, Christ God, long-suffering, great in mercy, great in compassion, loving the just and merciful to sinners, calling all to salvation by the promise of the blessings to come; do you, Lord, yourself accept our entreaties at this hour, and direct our lives to your commandments. Sanctify our souls, purify our bodies, correct our thoughts, cleanse our ideas and deliver us from every distress, evil, and pain. Wall us about with your holy Angels, that protected and guided by their host we may reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of your unapproachable glory; for you are blessed to the ages of ages. Amen.

Lord, have mercy

**(x3)***.* Glory. Both now. Greater in honour than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word, truly the Mother of God we magnify you. In the name of the Lord, bless, Father. ****

Priest:

May God take pity on us and bless us, show the light of his countenance on us and have mercy on us. ****

Then the Superior says following prayer:

Christ, the true light, who enlighten and hallow everyone who comes into the world, may the light of your countenance be signed upon us, that in it we may see your unapproachable light; and direct our steps to the doing of your commandments; at the intercessions of your most pure Mother and of all your Saints. Amen.

****

Reader:

To you my Champion and Commander I your city saved from disasters dedicate, O Mother of God, hymns of victory and thanksgiving; but as you have unassailable might from every kind of danger now deliver me, that I may cry to you: Hail, Bride without bridegroom!

****

And Dismissal.

3 Metanias, then the Psalms.

****

Psalm 16

Hearken to my righteousness, O Lord; attend to my supplication. Give ear to my prayer from lips which do not deceive. Let my judgement come from your presence, let my eyes see fair dealings. You have tested my heart, you have visited me by night; you have tried me by fire and no injustice has been found in me. That my mouth might not speak of human deeds, for the sake of the words of your lips I have kept hard ways. Direct my steps in your paths, that my steps may not slip. I have called, for you heard me, O God; incline your ear to me, and hearken to my words. Show the wonder of your mercies, you who save those that hope in you. Guard me, O Lord, like the pupil of the eye, from those who resist your right hand. You will shelter me in the shelter of your wings, from the presence of the impious who afflicted me. My foes have surrounded my soul; they have shut their hearts, their mouth has spoken proudly. They cast me out and now they have encircled me, they have fixed their eyes to bow to the ground. They came on me like a lion ready for prey, and like a lion cub lurking in hidden places. Arise, Lord, forestall them and cast them down; deliver my soul from the impious, your sword from the foes of your hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of the land in their life, and their belly was filled from your hidden things. They have been sated with swine’s flesh and left the remainder to their infants. But I in righteousness will appear in your presence; I shall be satisfied when your glory has appeared to me. ****

Psalm 24
To you, O Lord, I have lifted my soul. My God, I have trusted in you, do not let me be shamed for ever. Do not let my foes laugh at me; for all who wait patiently for you shall not be shamed; let those who transgress without cause be shamed. O Lord, make your ways known to me, and teach me your paths. Guide me into your truth and teach me, for you are God my Saviour, and I have waited patiently on you all the day. Remember your acts of pity, Lord, and your mercies, for they are eternal. Do not remember the sins of my youth and ignorance; in accordance with your mercy remember me, on account of your goodness, O Lord. The Lord is good and upright, therefore he will give laws to those who sin on their way. He will guide the meek with judgement, he will teach the meek his ways. All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, for those who seek his covenant and his testimonies. For your name’s sake, O Lord, pardon my sin, for it is great. Who is one who fears the Lord? He will give him laws in the way which he has chosen. His soul will dwell among good things and his seed will inherit the earth. The Lord is the strength of those who fear him, and his covenant will show them this. My eyes are ever towards the Lord, for he will draw my feet out of the snare. Look on me and have mercy on me; for I am alone and poor. The afflictions of my heart have been multiplied; bring me out of my troubles. See my humiliation and my toil, and forgive all my sins. See my foes, for they have been multiplied, and have hated me with an unjust hatred. Guard my soul and deliver me; let me not be shamed, for I have hoped in you. The innocent and upright have joined themselves to me, because I have waited patiently for you, O Lord. O God, deliver Israel from all his afflictions.

****

Psalm 50
Have mercy on me O God, according to your great mercy: according to the fullness of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my wickedness: and my sin is ever before me. Against you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight: that you may be justified in your words, and win when you are judged. For see, in wickedness I was conceived: and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have loved truth: you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed: you will wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness: the bones which have been humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins: and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God: and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out from your presence: and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your salvation: and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your ways: and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from bloodshed: and my tongue will rejoice at your righteousness. O Lord, you will open my lips: and my mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it: you will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit: a broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Zion, Lord, in your good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer calves upon your altar.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit.
Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God

**(x3)***.* **Metanias (x3)

Mother of God, you are the true vine, who gave bud to the fruit of life; we implore you, Sovereign Lady, intercede together with the Apostles and all the Saints that he have mercy on our souls.

Then at once:

Blessed is the Lord God, blessed is the Lord day by day; may the God of our salvation give us prosperity.

SIXTH HOUR

O come, let us worship and fall down before the King, our God.
O come, let us worship and fall down before Christ, the King, our God.
O come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King, our God.

****

With 3 Metanias, then the Psalms.

****

Psalm 53

O God, save my by your name, and you will judge me by your power. O God, hearken to my prayer, give ear to the words of my mouth. For strangers have risen up against me, and mighty ones have sought my soul, and have not put God before them. For see, God will help me, and the Lord is the protector of my soul. He will turn evils upon my foes, in your truth wipe them out. Willingly I shall sacrifice to you, I shall give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good. For you have delivered me from every affliction, and my eye has looked down on my foes. ****

Psalm 54
Give ear to my prayer, O God, and do not despise my supplication; attend to me, and hearken to me. I was grieved in my meditation, and troubled by the voice of the foe and the affliction of the sinner. Because they cast iniquity upon me, and in anger they were indignant with me. My heart was troubled within me, and dread of death fell on me. Fear and trembling came upon me, and darkness covered me. And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove’s, and I shall fly away and find rest. See, I have gone far away in my flight, and have encamped in the wilderness. I waited for God who saves me from faint-heartedness and from storm. O Lord, drown and divide their tongues; because I have seen iniquity and wrangling in the city. Day and night it will go round upon its walls, and lawlessness and toil are in its midst, and injustice. Usury and fraud have not left its streets. For if an enemy had reviled me, I would have endured it. And if one who hated me had boasted against me, I would have hidden from him. But it was you, one who was my equal, my leader and my friend. Who made sweet the food we ate together; we walked in harmony in God’s house. Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into Hades. For evil is in their dwellings and in their midst. But I cried to God and the Lord heard me. At evening and morning and at midday I shall speak and declare, and he will listen to my voice. He will redeem my soul in peace from those who draw near me, for in crowds they were about me. God will hear and he who is before the ages will humble them. For there is no change with them, because they did not fear God; he stretched out his hand to repay. They defiled his covenant; they were scattered at the wrath of his presence, and their hearts drew near. His words were smoother than oil, yet they are javelins. Cast your care on the Lord, and he will support you; he will not let the righteous be storm-tossed for ever. But you, O God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction. Men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days; but I, Lord, will hope in you.

****

Psalm 90
One who dwells in the help of the Most High will live under the protection of the of the God of heaven. He will say to the Lord: you are my protector and my refuge, my God, and I shall hope in him. For he will deliver you from the snare of hunters, and from the word which troubles. He will overshadow you with his wings, and beneath his feathers you will hope; his truth will encircle you with a shield. You will not be afraid of terror by night, of the arrow that flies by day. Of the thing that prowls in the darkness, of mishap and the noonday devil. A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right, but it will not come near you. But with your eyes you will observe, and see the reward of sinners. For you, Lord, are my hope: you have made the Most High your refuge. Evils will not approach you, nor a scourge draw near your dwelling. Because he has given orders to his Angels about you, to guard you in all your ways. They will bear you on their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone. You will walk on asp and basilisk, and trample down lion and dragon. Because he hoped in me, I shall deliver him; I shall shelter him, because he knew my name. He will cry to me, and I shall hear him, I am with him in trouble; I shall rescue him and glorify him. I shall fill him with length of days, and show him my salvation.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit.
Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God

Then the Apolytikion of the day. If there are two feasts the first Apolytikion is said before

** Glory **and the second after it.**

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Because we have no boldness on account of our many sins, entreat the One born of you, O Virgin Mother of God; for a Mother’s plea has great force for the kindness of the Master. Do not despise the supplications of sinners, O all-holy, for he is merciful, and able to save, he who even accepted to suffer for us.

****

Then at once:

***Prayer of Saint Basil The Great**

O God and Lord of powers, and Maker of all creation, who through the compassion of your incomprehensible mercy sent down your only-begotten Son, our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, for the salvation of our race, and through his precious Cross tore up the record of our sins, and by it triumphed over the principalities and powers of darkness; do you yourself, O Master who love mankind, accept also our supplications of thanksgiving and entreaty; and deliver us from destroying and dark transgression, and from all our foes, visible and invisible, who seek to harm us. Nail down our flesh through fear of you, and do not let our hearts incline to words or thoughts of evil, but wound our souls with longing for you; that ever gazing on you and guided by the light that comes from you, seeing you the unapproachable and everlasting light, we may give thanks to you, the Father without beginning, with your only-begotten Son and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

According to the Typica of the Holy Mountain the Reader at once adds:

It is truly meet to call you blessed, who gave birth to God, ever-blessed and most pure, and the Mother of our God. Greater in honour than the Cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word; truly the Mother of God, we magnify you.

****

Psalm 83

How beloved are your dwellings, O Lord of powers; my soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh rejoiced in the living God. For the sparrow has found itself a house, and the dove a nest for herself, where she may place her nestlings: your altars, O Lord of powers, my King and my God. Blessed are those who dwell in your house, they will praise you to ages of ages. Blessed the one whose help is from you; who has placed ascents in his heart, to the valley of weeping, to the place he has set. For the lawgiver will give blessings; they will go from strength to strength, the God of gods will appear in Sion. Lord God of powers hear my prayer, give ear, O God of Jacob. O God our shield see; and look on the face of your Christ. For one day in your courts is far better than thousands. I chose to be cast aside in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners. Lord God of powers, blessed is the one who hopes in you. ****

Psalm 84
You were well pleased with your land, O Lord, you turned away the captivity of Jacob. You forgave your people their iniquities, you covered all their sins. You made all your anger cease, you turned away from the anger of your rage. Turn us back again, O God of our salvation, and turn away your rage from us. Would you be angry with us for ever? Or will you prolong your wrath from generation to generation? O God, when you have turned us back you will make us live, and your people will rejoice in you. Lord, show us your mercy, and grant us your salvation. I will hear what the Lord will say in me; for he will speak peace to his people, to his holy ones, to those who turn their hearts back to him. But his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth have met, righteousness and peace have kissed. Truth has dawned from the earth, and righteousness has leaned down from heaven. For the Lord will give goodness, and our earth will give its fruit. Righteousness will walk before him, and set his steps in the way.

****

Psalm 85
Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear me, for I am poor and needy. Guard my soul, for I am holy; O my God, save your servant who hopes in you. Have mercy on me, Lord, for I shall cry to you all the day; give joy to the soul of your servant, for I have lifted up my soul to you. For you, O Lord, are good and gentle, and full of mercy to all who call on you. Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplication. In the day of my trouble I called to you, for you have heard me. There is none like you among the gods, O Lord; none whose works are as yours. All the nations whom you made will come and bow down before you, O Lord, and glorify your name. For you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God. Guide me, Lord, in your way, and I shall walk in your truth; make my heart glad to fear your name. I shall give you thanks, O Lord, my God, with my whole heart; and I shall glorify your name for ever. For your mercy is great towards me, and you have delivered my soul from the lowest Hell. O God, the lawless rose up against me, and an assembly of mighty ones sought my soul, and did not set you before them. And you, Lord, are pitying and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy and true. Look on me and have mercy on me; give your might to your servant and save the son of your maidservant. Make with me a sign for good, and let those who hate me see it and be shamed; for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.

****

And again:

Make with me a sign for good, and let those who hate me see it and be shamed; for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit.
Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God

**(x3)***.* Lord, have mercy **(x3)**.
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit. ****

Then the Apolytikion of the day. If there are two feasts, the first Apolytikion is said before

Glory **and the second after it.**

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

O Good one, born of a Virgin for our sakes and who endured crucifixion, who despoiled death by death and as God revealed resurrection, do not despise those whom you fashioned with your own hand; show your love for mankind, O Merciful; accept the Mother of God who bore you, as she intercedes for us, and save, O Saviour, a people in despair.

For your holy name’s sake do not finally reject us, do not annul your covenant, do not take your mercy from us for the sake of Abraham, your beloved, and for the sake of Isaac, your servant, and Israel, your holy one.

Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us

**(x3)***.
*Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your name’s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed; your kingdom come; your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. ****

Priest:

** For yours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. ****

Then the Kontakion of the day. On Sunday the Ypakoï.

*
*Lord, have mercy **(x40)***.*

At every time and at every hour, in heaven and on earth worshipped and glorified, Christ God, long-suffering, great in mercy, great in compassion, loving the just and merciful to sinners, calling all to salvation by the promise of the good things to come; do you, Lord, yourself accept our entreaties at this hour, and direct our lives to your commandments. Sanctify our souls, purify our bodies, correct our thoughts, cleanse our ideas and deliver us from every distress, evil, and pain. Wall us about with your holy Angels, that protected and guided by their host we may reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of your unapproachable glory; for you are blessed to the ages of ages. Amen.

Lord, have mercy

**(x3)**. Glory. Both now. Greater in honour than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word, truly the Mother of God we magnify you. In the name of the Lord, bless, Father. ****

Priest:

** May God take pity on us and bless us, and show the light of his countenance on us and have mercy on us. ****

Then the Superior says this

****

Prayer of Saint Basil the Great

Master, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, who have long endured our transgressions, and brought us to this hour in which, hanging on the life-giving tree, you showed the good Thief the way into Paradise and destroyed death by death, have mercy also on us sinners and your unworthy servants. For we have sinned and transgressed, and are not worthy to raise our eyes and look on the height of heaven, because we have abandoned the way of your justice and walked in the will of our hearts. But we implore your unbounded goodness: spare us, O Lord, according to the multitude of your mercy, and save us for your holy name’s sake, for our days have been wasted in vanity. Rescue us from the hand of our opponent, forgive us our sins, slay our carnal will, so that we, having put off the old man, may put on the new, and live for you, our Master and Benefactor; and that thus following your precepts we may reach eternal rest, where those who rejoice have their dwelling. For you are the true joy and gladness of those who love you, Christ our God, and to you we give glory, together with your Father who has no beginning, and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

****

And Dismissal.
