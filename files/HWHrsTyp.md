****

With 3 Metanias, then the Psalms.

Psalm 16

Hear my justice, O Lord, attend to my supplication. Give ear to my prayer from lips which do not deceive. Let my judgement come from your presence, let my eyes see fair dealings. You have tested my heart, you have visited me by night; you have tried me by fire and no injustice has been found in me. That my mouth might not speak of men’s deeds, for the sake of the words of your lips I have kept hard ways. Direct my steps in your paths, that my steps may not slip. I have called, for you have heard me, O God; incline your ear to me, and hear my words. Show the wonder of your mercies, you who save those who hope in you. Guard me, Lord, like the pupil of the eye, from those who resist your right hand. Shelter me in the shelter of your wings, from the presence of the impious who afflicted me. My foes have surrounded my soul; they have shut their hearts, their mouth has spoken proudly. They cast me out and now they have encircled me, they have set their eyes to bow to the ground. They came on me like a lion ready for prey, and like a lion cub dwelling in secret places. Arise, Lord, forestall them and cast them down; deliver my soul from the impious, your sword from the foes of your hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of the land in their life, and their belly was filled from your hidden things. They have been sated with swine’s flesh and left the remainder to their infants. But I in righteousness shall be seen in your presence; I shall be satisfied with the sight of your glory. ****

Psalm 24

To you, O Lord, I have lifted my soul. My God, I have trusted in you, do not let me be shamed for ever. Do not let my foes laugh at me; for all who wait patiently for you shall not be shamed; let those who transgress without cause be shamed. O Lord, let me know your ways, and teach me your paths. Guide me into your truth and teach me, for you are God my Saviour, and I have waited patiently on you all the day. Remember your pity, Lord, and your mercies, for they are eternal. Do not remember the sins and follies of my youth, according to your mercy remember me, on account of your goodness, O Lord. The Lord is good and upright, therefore he will give laws to those who sin in the way. He will guide the meek with judgement, he will teach the meek his ways. All the Lord’s ways are mercy and truth, for those who seek his covenant and his testimonies. For your name’s sake, O Lord, pardon my sin, for it is great. Who is a one who fears the Lord? He will give him laws in the way which he has chosen. His soul will dwell among good things and his seed will inherit the earth. The Lord is the strength of those who fear him, and his covenant will show them this. My eyes are ever towards the Lord, for he will draw my feet out of the snare. Look on me and have mercy on me; for I am alone and poor. The afflictions of my heart have been multiplied; bring me out of my troubles. See my humiliation and my toil, and forgive all my sins. See my foes, for they have been multiplied, and have hated me with an unjust hatred. Guard my soul and deliver me; let me not be shamed, for I have hoped in you. The innocent and upright have joined themselves to me, because I have waited patiently for you, O Lord. O God, deliver Israel from all his afflictions. ****

Psalm 50

Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with your great mercy. According to the multitude of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you alone I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words and win when you are judged. For see, in wickedness I was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your salvation, and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it. You will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer calves upon your altar.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (

**x3**) ****

**The current Greek books prescribe the Troparion** Behold the Bridegroom**, as at Matins, for the Hours on the first three days of Holy Week, rather than the Lenten verses.
**Behold, the Bridegroom comes in the middle of the night, and blessed is that servant whom he finds watching; but unworthy is the one whom he finds slothful. Take care then, my soul, not to be overcome with sleep, lest you be given up to death, and be shut out of the kingdom; but rouse yourself and cry: Holy, holy, holy are you, O God; through the Mother of God, have mercy on us.\]

Glory. Both now.

On Monday
Kontakion. Tone 8.

Jacob lamented the loss of Joseph, and the noble one was seated in a chariot, honoured like a king; for as he had not been slave to the pleasures of the Egyptian woman, he was glorified in return by the one who sees the hearts of men, and bestows an incorruptible crown.

****

On Tuesday
Kontakion. Tone 2

Think, miserable soul, on the hour of the end, and made fearful by the cutting down of the fig tree, work with love of toil at the talent given you, as you watch and cry: May we not be left outside Christ’s bridal chamber!

****

On Wednesday
Kontakion. Tone 4. Lifted up on the Cross.

I have transgressed far more than the harlot, O Good One, yet have never brought you showers of tears; but entreating in silence I fall before you, as I kiss your immaculate feet with love, that as Master you may grant me forgiveness of offences, as I cry out, my Saviour, ‘Deliver me from the filth of my works’.

****

Then:

Lord, have mercy. **** (**x40**)

At every time and at every hour, in heaven and on earth worshipped and glorified, Christ God, long-suffering, great in mercy, great in compassion, loving the just and merciful to sinners, calling all to salvation by the promise of the good things to come; do you, Lord, yourself accept our entreaties at this hour, and direct our lives to your commandments. Sanctify our souls, purify our bodies, correct our thoughts, cleanse our ideas and deliver us from every distress, evil, and pain. Wall us about with your holy Angels, that protected and guided by their host we may reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of your unapproachable glory; for you are blessed to the ages of ages. Amen.

Lord, have mercy (

**x3**), Glory. Both now. Greater in honour than the Cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word. Truly the Mother of God, we magnify you. In the name of the Lord, bless, Father. ****

Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King, our God.

****

With 3 Metanias, then the Psalms.

Psalm 53

O God, save my by your name, and you will judge me by your power. O God, hear my prayer, give ear to the words of my mouth. For strangers have risen up against me, and mighty ones have sought my soul, and have not put God before them. For see, God will help me, and the Lord is the protector of my soul. He will turn evils upon my foes, in your truth wipe them out. Willingly I shall sacrifice to you, I shall give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good. For you have delivered me from every tribulation, and my eye has looked down on my foes. ****

Psalm 54

Give ear to my prayer, O God, and do not despise my supplication; attend to me, and hear me. I was grieved in my meditation, and troubled by the voice of the foe and the tribulation of the sinner. Because they cast iniquity upon me, and in anger they were indignant with me. My heart was troubled within me, and fear of death fell on me. Fear and trembling came upon me, and darkness covered me. And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove’s, and I shall fly away and find rest. See, I have gone far away in my flight, and have encamped in the wilderness. I waited for God who saves me from faint-heartedness and from storm. O Lord, drown and divide their tongues; because I have seen iniquity and wrangling in the city. Day and night it will go round upon its walls, and lawlessness and toil are in its midst, and injustice. Usury and fraud have not left its streets. For if an enemy had reviled me, I would have endured it. And if one who hated me had boasted against me, I would have hidden from him. But it was you, a man my equal, my guide and my friend. Who made sweet the food we ate together; we walked in harmony in God’s house. Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell. For evil is in their dwellings and in their midst. But I cried to God and the Lord heard me. At evening and morning and at midday I shall speak and declare, and you will listen to my voice. He will redeem my soul in peace from those who draw near me, for in crowds they were about me. God will hear and he who is before the ages will humble them. For there is no change with them, because they have not feared God. He has stretched out his hand to repay. They have defiled his covenant; they have been divided by the wrath from his presence, and their have drawn near. Their words were smoother than oil, yet they are javelins. Cast your care on the Lord, and he will support you; he will not let the just waver for ever. But you, O God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction. Men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days; but I, Lord, shall hope in you. ****

Psalm 90

One who dwells in the help of the Most High will live under the protection of the of the God of heaven; will say to the Lord: you are my protector and my refuge, my God, and I shall hope in him. For he will deliver you from the snare of hunters, and from the word which troubles. He will overshadow you with his wings, and beneath his feathers you will hope; his truth will encircle you with a shield. You will not be afraid of terror by night, of the arrow that flies by day; of the thing that prowls in the darkness, of mishap and the noonday devil. A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right, but it will not come near you. But with your eyes you will observe, and see the reward of sinners. For you, Lord, are my hope: you have made the Most High your refuge. Evils will not approach you, nor a scourge draw near your dwelling. Because he has given orders to his Angels about you, to guard you in all your ways. They will bear you on their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone. You will walk on asp and basilisk, and trample down lion and dragon. Because he hoped in me, I shall deliver him; I shall shelter him, because he knew my name. He will cry to me, and I shall hear him, I am with him in trouble; I shall rescue him and glorify him. I shall fill him with length of days, and show him my salvation.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (**x3)**

Then the appointed Kathisma of the Psalter.

Tone 2.

On the sixth day and at the sixth hour you nailed to the Cross the sin that Adam dared in Paradise. Tear up the record of our offences, Christ God, and save us.

Verse 1.

Verse 2.

I cried to God and the Lord heard me.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Because we have no boldness because of our many sins, entreat the One born of you, O Virgin Mother of God; for a Mother’s plea has great force for the kindness of the Master. Do not despise the supplications of sinners, O all-holy, for you is merciful, and able to save, you who even accepted to suffer for us.

****

Verse:

Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue with rejoicing.

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Ezekiel.
\[

**1:1-20**\]

In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the river Chobar, the heavens were opened, and I saw a vision of God. On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Joachim), the word of the Lord came to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chobar; and the hand of the Lord was on me. As I looked, a stormy wind came out of the north: a great cloud with brightness around it and fire flashing forth continually, and in the middle of the fire, an appearance of amber, and a radiance in it. In the middle of it was a likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they were of human form. Each had four faces, and each of them had four wings. Their legs were straight, and their feet were winged; and there were sparks like burnished bronze. Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus: their wings touched one another; each of them moved straight ahead, without turning as they moved. As for the appearance of their faces: the four had the face of a human being, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an calf on the left side, and the face of an eagle; such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies. Each moved straight ahead; wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went. In the middle of the living creatures there was an appearance that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches moving to and fro among the living creatures; the fire was bright, and lightning issued from the fire. The living creatures darted to and fro, like a form of Bezek. As I looked, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them. As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl; and the four had the same form, their construction being something like a wheel within a wheel. When they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without veering as they moved. Their rims were tall. And I saw that the rims of all four were full of eyes all around. When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. Wherever the cloud was, there also the spirit would go; the living creatures went, and the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of life was in the wheels.

Prokeimenon. Tone 6. Psalm 126.

If the Lord does not build the house, \* in vain have the builders toiled.

****

Verse:

If the Lord does not guard the city, in vain has the guard kept vigil. ****

On Tuesday
Troparion of the Prophecy. Tone 1.

Those who offend beyond measure pardon richly, O Saviour. Count us worthy without condemnation to worship your holy Resurrection, at the prayers of most pure Mother, O alone full of mercy.

Glory.

Count us worthy without condemnation to worship your holy Resurrection, at the prayers of most pure Mother, O alone full of mercy.

Both now.

Those who offend beyond measure pardon richly, O Saviour. Count us worthy without condemnation to worship your holy Resurrection, at the prayers of most pure Mother, O alone full of mercy.

Prokeimenon. Tone 6. Psalm 129.

Because with the Lord there is mercy, and with him abundant redemption: \* and he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

****

Verse:

Out of the depths I have cried to you, O Lord; Lord, hear my voice.

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Ezekiel.
\[**1:21-28\]**

When the living creatures moved, the wheels also moved; when they stopped, the others stopped; and when they rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of life was in the wheels. Over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of a firmament, shining like crystal, spread out above their wings. Under the firmament their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another; and each of the creatures had two wings covering its body. When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty waters, like the voice of God Sadday, a sound of speech like the sound of an army; when they stopped, they let down their wings. And there came a voice from above the firmament over their heads; when they stopped, they let down their wings. And above the firmament over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was the likeness of a human form. Upward from what appeared like the loins I saw something like gleaming amber, something that looked like fire enclosed all around; and downward from what looked like the loins I saw something that looked like fire, and there was a splendour all around. Like the bow in a cloud on a rainy day, such was the appearance of the splendour all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.

Prokeimenon. Tone 4. Psalm 130.

Let Israel hope in the Lord, \* from henceforth and for evermore.

****

Verse:

** Lord, my heart has not been exalted, nor have my eyes become lofty. ****

On Wednesday
Troparion of the Prophecy. Tone 2.

To-day the evil Sanhedrin has assembled and meditated vain things against you; to-day Judas from his agreement receives a noose as pledge; Caiaphas unwillingly confesses that one man will accept the voluntary passion for the sake of all. Christ God, our Redeemer, glory to you.

Prokeimenon. Tone 8. Psalm 133.

May the Lord bless you from Sion: \* he who made heaven and earth.

****

Verse:

Come now, bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord.

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Ezekiel.
\[**2:3-3:3\]**

The Lord said to me, Son of man, I am sending you to the people of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have transgressed against me to this very day. The descendants are impudent and stubborn. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord.’ Whether they hear or tremble (for they are a rebellious house), they shall know that you are a prophet among them. And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, and do not be amazed at their looks, for they will provoke and rise up against you round about, and you live among scorpions; do not be afraid of their words, and do not be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house. You shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or tremble; for they are a rebellious house. But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you. I looked, and a hand was stretched out to me, and a written scroll was in it. He spread it before me; it had writing on the front and on the back, and written on it were words of lamentation and mourning and woe. He said to me, son of man, eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel. So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat. He said to me, Son of man, your mouth eats this scroll that is given you and your belly will be filled with it. Then I ate it; and in my mouth it was as sweet as honey.

Prokeimenon. Tone 2. Psalm 134.

You who fear the Lord, \* bless the Lord.

**x3**), Glory. Both now. Greater in honour than the Cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word. Truly the Mother of God, we magnify you. In the name of the Lord, bless, Father. ****

Priest:

Through the prayers of our holy fathers Lord Jesus Christ our God have mercy on us. ****

Then the prayer of St Ephrem with 4 full and 12 small metanias

Lord and Master of my life, do not give me a spirit of sloth, idle curiosity, love of power and useless chatter. (

**Prostration**)

Rather accord to me, your servant, a spirit of chastity, humility, patience and love. (

**Prostration**)

Yes, Lord and King, grant me to see my own faults, and not to condemn my brother; for you are blessed to the ages of ages. Amen. (

**Prostration**) ****

The 12 small metanias and then the last sentence of the prayer is repeated with one prostration.

\[

**Then** Trisagion, All-holy Trinity, Our Father, For yours, Lord, have mercy (**x12**) Glory, Both now.\] ****

Then the Superior says the following

Prayer of Saint Basil the Great

O God and Lord of powers, and Maker of all creation, who through the compassion of your incomprehensible mercy sent down your only-begotten Son, our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, for the salvation of our race, and through his precious Cross tore up the record of our sins, and by it triumphed over the principalities and powers of darkness; do you yourself, O Master who loves mankind, accept also our supplications of thanksgiving and entreaty; and deliver us from destroying and dark transgression, and from all our foes, visible and invisible, who seek to harm us. Nail down our flesh through fear of you, and do not let our hearts incline to words or thoughts of evil, but wound our souls with longing for you; that ever gazing upon you and guided by the light that comes from you, seeing you the unapproachable and everlasting light, we may give thanks to you, the Father without beginning, with your only-begotten Son and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and ever and to the ages of ages. Amen.

\[

**According to the Typica of the Holy Mountain the Reader at once adds:**

It is truly right to call you blessed, who gave birth to God, ever-blessed and most pure and the Mother of our God. Greater in honour than the Cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word. Truly the Mother of God, we magnify you.\]

NINTH HOUR

Come, let us worship and fall down before the King, our God.
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ, the King, our God.
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King, our God.

****

With 3 Metanias, then the Psalms.

Psalm 83

How beloved are your dwellings, O Lord of hosts; my soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God. For the sparrow has found itself a house, and the dove a nest for herself, where she may place her nestlings. your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God. Blessed are those who dwell in your house, they will praise you for ever and ever. Blessed the man whose help is from you; he has placed ascents in his heart, to the valley of weeping, to the place he has set. For the lawgiver will give blessings; they will go from strength to strength, the God of gods will appear in Sion. O Lord God of hosts hear my prayer, give ear, O God of Jacob. O God our shield see; and look on the face of your Christ. For one day in your courts is far better than thousands. I have chosen to be cast aside in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners. O Lord God of hosts, blessed the man who hopes in you. ****

Psalm 84

You have been well pleased with your land, O Lord, you have turned away the captivity of Jacob. You have forgiven your people their iniquities, you have covered all their sins. You have made all your anger cease, you have turned away from the anger of your rage. Turn us back again, O God of our salvation, and turn away your rage from us. Will you be angry with us for ever? Or will you prolong your wrath from generation to generation? O God, when you have turned us back you will make us live, and your people will rejoice in you. O Lord, show us your mercy, and grant us your salvation. I shall hear what the Lord will say in me; for he will speak peace to his people, to his holy ones, to those who turn their hearts back to him. But his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth have met, justice and peace have kissed. Truth has dawned from the earth, and justice has leaned down from heaven. For the Lord will give goodness, and our earth will give its fruit. Justice will walk before him, and set his steps in the way. ****

Psalm 85

Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear me, for I am poor and needy. Guard my soul, for I am holy; O my God, save your servant who hopes in you. Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I shall cry to you all the day; give joy to the soul of your servant, for I have lifted up my soul to you. For you, O Lord, are good and gentle, and full of mercy to all who call on you. Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplication. In the day of my trouble I called to you, for you heard me. There is none like you among the gods, O Lord; none whose works are as yours. All the nations whom you made will come and worship before you, O Lord, and call upon your name. For you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God. Guide me, O Lord, in your way, and I shall walk in your truth; make my heart glad to fear your name. I shall give you thanks, O Lord, my God, with my whole heart; and I shall glorify your name for ever. For your mercy is great towards me, and you have delivered my soul from the lowest hell. O God, the lawless rose up against me, and an assembly of mighty ones sought my soul, and did not set you before them. And you, Lord, are pitying and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy and true. Look on me and have mercy on me; give your might to your servant and save the son of your maidservant. Make with me a sign for good, and let those who hate me see it and be shamed; for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me. ****

And again:

Make with me a sign for good, and let those who hate me see it and be shamed; for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (

**x3**) ****

Then the appointed Kathisma of the Psalter.

Tone 8.

Christ our God, who at the ninth hour tasted death in the flesh for our sakes, slay our carnal will and save us.

****

Verse 1:

May my supplication come into your presence, O Lord, according to your word give me understanding. ****

Verse 2:

Let my petition come into your presence, O Lord, according to your word save me.

Glory. Both now. Theotokion.

O Good One, who was born of a Virgin for our sakes and endured crucifixion; who despoiled death by death and as God revealed resurrection, do not despise those whom you fashioned with your own hand; show your love for mankind, O Merciful, accept the Mother of God who bore you, as she intercedes for us, and save, O Saviour, a people in despair.

\[

**The current Greek books prescribe the Troparion** Behold the Bridegroom**, as at Matins, for the Hours on the first three days of Holy Week, rather than the Lenten verses.
**Behold, the Bridegroom comes in the middle of the night, and blessed is that servant whom he finds watching; but unworthy is the one whom he finds slothful. Take care then, my soul, not to be overcome with sleep, lest you be given up to death, and be shut out of the kingdom; but rouse yourself and cry: Holy, holy, holy are you, O God; through the Mother of God, have mercy on us.\] ****

Priest:

And that he would count us worthy to listen to the holy Gospel, let us pray to the Lord God. ****

Reader:

Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy, Lord, have mercy. ****

Priest:

Wisdom. Stand upright. Let us listen to the holy Gospel. Peace to all. ****

**The Russian Typikon inserts the following rubric at this point: Then on Monday the reading from St Ephrem on Joseph the Most Virtuous.

For your holy name’s sake do not finally reject us, do not annul your covenant, do not take your mercy from us for the sake of Abraham, your beloved, and for the sake of Isaac, your servant, and Israel, your holy one.

Trisagion,

All-holy Trinity. Our Father. For yours. ****

On Monday
Kontakion. Tone 8

Jacob lamented the loss of Joseph, and the noble one was seated in a chariot, honoured like a king; for as he had not been slave to the pleasures of the Egyptian woman, he was glorified in return by the one who sees the hearts of men, and bestows an incorruptible crown.

****

On Tuesday
Kontakion. Tone 2

Think, miserable soul, on the hour of the end, and made fearful by the cutting down of the fig tree, work with love of toil at the talent given you, as you watch and cry: May we not be left outside Christ’s bridal chamber!

**On Wednesday
Kontakion. Tone 4. Lifted up on the Cross**

I have transgressed far more than the harlot, O Good One, yet have never brought you showers of tears; but entreating in silence I fall before you, as I kiss your immaculate feet with love, that as Master you may grant me forgiveness of offences, as I cry out, O Saviour. ‘Deliver me from the filth of my works’.

****

Then:

Lord, have mercy. (**x40**)

\[

**According to the Russian Typikon the prayer** At every time and at every hour **is said here, and not at the end of the Typika.**\]

Glory. Both now. Greater in honour than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word, true Mother of God you we magnify. In the name of the Lord, bless, Father.

****

Priest:

May God take pity on us and bless us and shed the light of his countenance on us and have mercy on us. ****

Then we say the Prayer of St Ephrem.

Lord and Master of my life, do not give me a spirit of sloth, idle curiosity, love of power and useless chatter. (

**Prostration**)

Rather accord to me, your servant, a spirit of sobriety, humility, patience and love. (

**Prostration**)

Yes, Lord and King, grant me to see my own faults and not to condemn my brother; for you are blessed to the ages of ages. Amen. (

**Prostration**) ****

The Superior says the

Prayer of Saint Basil the Great

Master, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, who have long endured our transgressions, and brought us to this hour in which hanging on the life-giving tree you showed the good Thief the way into Paradise and destroyed death by death, have mercy also on us sinners and your unworthy servants. For we have sinned and trespassed and are not worthy to raise our eyes and look on the height of heaven; because we have abandoned the way of your justice and walked in the will of our hearts. But we implore your unbounded goodness: spare us, O Lord, according to the multitude of your mercy, and save us for your holy name’s sake, for our days have been wasted in vanity. Rescue us from the hand of our opponent, forgive us our sins, slay our carnal will, that we, having put off the old man, may put on the new, and live for you, our Master and benefactor; and that thus following your precepts we may reach eternal rest, where those who rejoice have their dwelling. For you are the true joy and gladness of those who love you, Christ our God, and to you we give glory, together with your Father who has no beginning, and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and always and to ages of ages. Amen. ****

Then we begin the Beatitudes, singing after each one, in the 8th Tone,

Remember us, O Lord, when you come in your kingdom. ****

And also after

Glory. Both now. **At each** Remember **we make a small metania.**

In your kingdom remember us, O Lord, when you come in your kingdom. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after justice, for they shall be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for justice’s sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.
Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
Both now and ever and to ages of ages. Amen.

****

The choirs unite and the following are sung more solemnly and we make a full metania at each one.

Remember us, O Lord, when you come in your kingdom.
Remember us, O Master, when you come in your kingdom.
Remember us, O Holy One, when you come in your kingdom.

The heavenly choir hymns you and says: Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord Sabaoth, heaven and earth are full of your glory.

****

Verse:

Come to him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be ashamed.

The heavenly choir hymns you and says: Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord Sabaoth, heaven and earth are full of your glory.

Glory.

The choir of holy Angels and Archangels with all the heavenly Powers hymns you and says: Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord Sabaoth, heaven and earth are full of your glory.

Both now.

I believe in one God, Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten from the Father before all ages, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father, through him all things were made. For our sake and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and was incarnate from the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man. He was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried; he rose again on the third day, in accordance with the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He is coming again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life, who proceeds from the Father, who together with Father and Son is worshipped and together glorified; who spoke through the Prophets. In one Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins. I await the resurrection of the dead and the life of the age to come. Amen.

****

Then

Remit, forgive, pardon, O God, our offences, willing and unwilling, in deed and in word, in knowledge and in ignorance, of the day and of the night, in mind and in thought; pardon them all, as you are good and love mankind.

At every time and at every hour, in heaven and on earth worshipped and glorified, Christ God, long-suffering, great in mercy, great in compassion, loving the just and merciful to sinners, calling all to salvation by the promise of the good things to come; do you, Lord, yourself accept our entreaties at this hour, and direct our lives to your commandments. Sanctify our souls, purify our bodies, correct our thoughts, cleanse our ideas and deliver us from every distress, evil, and pain. Wall us about with your holy Angels, that protected and guided by their host we may reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge of your unapproachable glory; for you are blessed to the ages of ages.

Glory. Both now. Lord, have mercy (**x3**). Give the blessing, Father. And the Dismissal. ****

Priest:

May he who comes to his voluntary passion, Christ our true God, through the prayers of his all-pure and holy Mother, by the power of the precious and life-giving Cross, of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles, \[of Saint **N. (to whom the Church is dedicated)**, of Saint **N.**, whose memory we keep today,\] and of all the Saints, have mercy on us and save us, for he is good and loves mankind.

\[

**On Great Wednesday, according to the Russian Typikon, instead of the above Dismissal, the Superior says the following Dismissal, followed by the ceremony of mutual forgiveness:**

Most merciful Master, Lord Jesus Christ our God, at the prayers of our all-pure Lady, Mother of God, and ever-virgin Mary; by the power of the precious and life-giving Cross, the protection of the honourable heavenly Bodiless Powers, the intercessions of the honourable, glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist John; of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles; of the holy, glorious and right-victorious Martyrs; of our venerable and god-bearing Fathers; of the holy and just Forebears of God Joachim and Anne; make our prayer acceptable. Grant us forgiveness of our offences. Shelter us under the shelter of your wings. Drive far from us every foe and enemy. Make our lives peaceful. Lord, have mercy on us and on your world, and save our saves, as you are good and love mankind.

Then the Superior making a metania to the ground says to the Brothers:

Bless, Fathers, and pardon me a sinner. ****

May ** God pardon you, holy Father. **And the Brothers begin two by two, one from either Choir according to rank, to do the same, and to ask and receive pardon until all have done so.**
