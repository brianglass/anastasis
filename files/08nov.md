The Assembly of the Chief Captains Michael and Gabriel, and the rest of the Bodiless Powers.

AT VESPERS
----------

**At** Lord, I have cried **we insert 6 Stichera and we sing Prosomia of Michael.**

Tone 4. As noble among Martyrs.

Brightest attendant of the three-sunned Godhead, Michael Chief Captain, with the Powers on high you cry with joy: Holy are you, O Father, Holy are you, O co-eternal Word, Holy too are you, O Holy Spirit; one glory, one kingship, one nature, one Godhead and Power.

Fiery your form and wonderful your beauty, Michael first of Angels, for with your immaterial nature you pass through the ends of the world fulfilling the orders of the Maker of all things, recognised as powerful in your strength, and making your temple, honoured with your holy name, a source of healings.

O Lord, who make spirits your Angels, as it is written, and a flame of fire those who minister to you, you have declared Michael the Chief Captain as leader of your Archangels, who is wholly subject to your wishes, O Word, and cries aloud with fear the thrice-holy hymn to your glory.

****

Of Gabriel. The same tone. You have given us a sign.

The eternal Mind established you, Gabriel, as second light, lighting the whole world with participation in divine gifts and revealing to us the divine and truly great mystery from all eternity: the bodiless being embodied in a Virgin womb and becoming man to save mankind.

As you attend the throne of the Godhead with triple sun and with the splendours that pour from it unceasingly flood those of us on earth who stand harmoniously in choir and praise you, free us from the fog of passions and make us radiant with enlightenment, O Gabriel Chief Captain, intercessor for our souls.

Shatter the assaults of Hagar’s off-spring, incessantly directed at your flock; abate the schisms of the Church; calm the swell of measureless temptations; from dangers and troubles deliver us who honour you with love, O Gabriel Chief Captain, intercessor for our souls.

Glory.

**Tone 6. By Byzantios.**

Rejoice with us, all you commanders of the Angels, for your leader and our champion, the great Chief Captain, marvellously appearing today in his sacred shrine, sanctifies it; therefore as is right let us cry out to him with songs of praise: Shelter us in the shelter of your wings, Michael greatest of Archangels!

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Rejoice with us, all you choirs of Virgins; for our protection, intermediary, shelter and great refuge, marvellously appearing today in her sacred shrine, sanctifies it; therefore as is right let us cry out to her with song of praise: Shelter us in the shelter of your wings, immaculate Lady, Mother of God.

Entrance;

O Joyful Light; **the Prokeimenon of the day, and the Readings.**

The Reading is from Jesus son of Navi.
\[

**5, 13-15**\]

It came to pass, when Jesus was in Jericho, that he looked up with his eyes and saw a man standing in front of him, and his drawn sword was in his hand. And Jesus approached him and said: ‘Are you one of ours? Or are you one of the enemy’s?’ But he said to him: ‘I am Chief Captain of the power of the Lord, and now I have come here’. And Jesus fell on his face to the ground and said: ‘Master, what orders have you for your servant?’ And the Chief Captain of the Lord said to Jesus: ‘Untie the sandals from your feet; for the place where you are standing is holy’; and Jesus did so.

The Reading is from Judges.
\[

**6, 6.11-24**\]

It came to pass in that day that Madiam prevailed against the children of Israel, and they cried to God. And behold, the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the oak of Joas in Ephrata, and Gedeon his son was threshing wheat in the wine-press, and hastening to escape from the presence of Madiam. And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him: ‘The Lord is with you, powerful in strength’. And Gedeon said to him: ‘In me, my Lord; and if the Lord is with us, why have all these evils come upon us? And where are all his wonders, of which our fathers told us, saying: ‘Did not the Lord lead us up out of Egypt?’ And now he has abandoned us, and handed us over to the hand of Madiam’. And the Angel of the Lord looked on him and said to him: ‘Go in this strength of yours and you will save Israel from the hand of Madiam. See, I have sent you’. And Gedeon said to him: ‘In me, Lord. How shall I save Israel? See, my thousand is the humblest in Manasse, and I am the smallest in my father’s house’. And the Angel of the Lord said to him: ‘The Lord will be with you, and you will smite Madiam as one man’. And Gedeon said to him: ‘If I have found grace in your eyes, and you do for me to-day everything of which you have spoken with me, do not, pray, leave here until I come back to you, and I shall bring my sacrifice and offer sacrifice before you’. And he said; ‘I am, I shall sit here until you return’. And Gedeon went and prepared a goat kid and an measure of unleavened flour, and he put the meat in a basket and the broth he put in a pot and brought them to him under the oak, and approached. And the Angel of the Lord said to him: ‘Take the meat and the unleavened loaves and put them on that rock and pour out the broth next it’. And he did so. And the Angel of the Lord stretched out the tip of the rod in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened loaves; and fire was kindled from the rock and it devoured the meat and the unleavened loaves; and the Angel of the Lord disappeared from his sight. And Gedeon saw that it was the Angel of the Lord, and Gedeon said: ‘Alas Lord, Lord! Because I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face’. And the Lord said to him: ‘Peace to you, do not be afraid, you shall not die’. And Gedeon built there an altar to the Lord, and called it PEACE OF THE LORD until this day.

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Daniel.
\[

**10, 1-21**\]

In the third year of Cyrus, king of the Persians, a word was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Baltasar; and the word was true and mighty power, and understanding was given him in a vision. In those days, I Daniel had been mourning for three weeks of days. And desiring bread, I did not eat, and meat and wine did not enter my mouth, I did not anoint myself with oil until the completion of the three weeks of days. And on the twenty fourth of the first month in the third year, I was near the great river, that is the Tigris. And I raised my eyes and looked, and behold a man, clothed in linen, his loins girt with gold of Ophaz; and his body was as Tharsis, and his face like the sight of lightning, and his eyes like lamps of fire, and his arms and legs like the sight of gleaming bronze, and the sound of his words was as the sound of a multitude. And I Daniel alone saw the vision, and the men who were with me saw nothing; but great amazement fell on them and they fled in fear. And I was left alone, and I saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me, and my glory was turned to corruption, and I retained no strength. And I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of his words I was stunned with my face to the ground. And behold a hand was touching me and raised me onto my knees and the knuckles of my hands. And he said to me; ‘Daniel, man of desires, understand by the words which I speak to you, and stand upright, because I have been sent to you’; and when he had spoken this word to me I arose trembling. And he said to me: ‘Daniel, do not be afraid, because from the first day that you gave your heart to understand and to be afflicted before the Lord your God, your words were heard, and I have come through your words. And the Ruler of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me for twenty one days; and behold Michael one of the chief Rulers came to help me, and I left him there with the Ruler of the kingdom of the Persians. And I have come to make you understand all that will happen to your people in the last days; because the vision is yet for days ahead’. And when he spoke to me in these words, I put my face to the ground and was stunned. And behold as the likeness of a son of man touched my lips; and I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to the one who stood in front of me: ‘Lord, at the sight of you, my inward parts were turned within me, and I had no strength. And how will your servant, Lord, be able to speak with my Lord? And from now on strength will not remain in me, and breath has not been left in me’. And once again there touched me as it were the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me and said to me: ‘Do not be afraid, man of desires, peace be with you; be a man and be strong’. And when he had spoken with me I grew strong and said: ‘Let my Lord speak to me, for you have given me strength’. And he said: ‘Do you know why I have come to you? And now I shall return to make war on the Ruler of the Persians; and as I was going in the Ruler of the Greeks came. But I shall tell you what is ordained in the scripture of truth, and there is not one that upholds me against these, but Michael your Ruler’.

Today the temple that contains God, the Mother of God, is brought into the Lord’s temple and Zachary receives her.

As general and champion and Prince of Angels, free from every constraint, trouble and disease and from grievous sins those who sincerely praise and openly implore you, glorious Chief Captain, who as immaterial look on the Immaterial and are illumined by the unapproachable light of the Master’s glory; for he with love for mankind took flesh from a Virgin for our sakes, as he wished to save humanity.

**The same.**

Both now.

All we believers, let us praise the uncreated Trinity which directs all the immaterial ranks of the choirs on high, as we cry out: Holy, Holy, Holy are you, O God Almighty.

As the beginning of your creatures, O Maker, you set in place the bodiless nature of the Angels, encircling your immaculate throne, to cry to you: Holy, Holy, Holy are you, O God Almighty.

Eve, the foremother, once made the human race subject to the curse by her transgression; but you, Virgin Bride of God, led the whole race to blessing, by giving birth to the Creator.

By Clement.

Ode 1. The same Tone.

Come, as we join the dance, let us praise in songs the spiritual choirs of the bodiless ranks as Ministers of God, who tirelessly intercede for our salvation, and rejoice at our repentance.

The princes and leaders, and shining captains of the Angels today rouse the bodiless Minds to a festive celebration of their bright memory, with whom mankind rejoices, as it brings a hymn to the Trinity.

Let us mortals be glad together with the Angels, with spiritual joy; now Gabriel again brings the good news, the union of the Churches and the removal of every hostile heresy, on the coming of their commemoration.

****

Theotokion.

Immaculate one, you bore the Father’s Word, who dwelt supernaturally in you, by the Holy Spirit; being in two natures and wills, but in one person without change, whose form we kiss in greeting.

****

Katavasia.

I will open my mouth. ****

Ode 3. Plant your fear, Lord.

With strength, O Immortal, you established mighty beings to accomplish your all-holy will, who ever stand before you in the highest.

Accept the leaders of the Angels, the initiates of your incarnation and of your hallowed rising, O Christ, as they intercede on our behalf.

In your compassion, O Christ, you have placed Angels as guardians of mankind, and made them the ministers of the salvation of your servants.

****

Theotokion.

Ineffably, O Bride of God, you conceived the Lord, the Saviour who redeems from dangers us who call on you in truth.

You are the foundation.

First of the Angels and second light after the Trinity, Prince Michael, you have appeared to us who praise you faithfully.

O Mother of God. ****

Kathisma. Tone 8. Taking knowledge.

In our desire to praise the choirs of Bodiless Powers, let us on earth imitate as far as we are able their holiness, by deadening all the limbs of the flesh, asking them as champions and protectors to deliver from every deception of the invisible foe us who sing their praise, that we may find mercy.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

We ever thank you, Mother of God, and we magnify and worship you, Pure Virgin Full of grace, as we praise your childbearing, crying out unceasingly: Save us, Virgin All-merciful, as you are good, and deliver us from dread reckoning of the demons at the hour of judgement, that your servants may not be put to shame.

You mounted upon horses, Lord.

You mounted upon Angels, as upon horses, Lover of mankind, and took their reins in your hands, and your riding became salvation for those who ceaselessly cry out to you: Glory to your power, O Lord.

Your virtue covers Angels, Lover of mankind, and the ends of the earth are full of your glorious, divine praise, O Unoriginate, which with the Angels cries out to you: Glory to your power, O Lord.

You, Lord, are my strength.

As Jesus son of Navi warred of old against Jericho, the Chief Captain of power appeared to him, great Michael, victor and champion, the leader of the Bodiless Powers; receiving strength from him, the servant of the Lord took the citadel captive.

A Prince of the bodiless Powers, great Gabriel, truly the great Archangel, once appeared to Zachary the priest bearing the good tidings of a child; and so when John, the voice of the Word, was born he gave his father back his voice.

All the ends of the earth rejoice with joy today, as they celebrate the sacred memory of your Archangels, O God, of godlike Michael and of Gabriel, inspired by God; and the whole order of Angels rejoices with them, because the world is saved by their protection.

****

Theotokion.

You alone are pure even after child-birth; you alone were seen, though unwedded, giving suck to the true Word of God when, by the Holy Spirit, he had taken the form of a servant that is ours, O Virgin Mother of God; as we honour his appearing, we reverence the likeness of his form.

Katavasia.

Ode 5.

By the light of your knowledge.

Ever borne with unalterable longing towards the steep ascent, towards you, O Christ, the summit of all desires, the angelic Powers ceaselessly glorify you.

O Christ, you have established singers of your greatness, spiritual in their nature, imperishable by your grace; you have created your Angels in your image, O Incomprehensible.

You have kept your ministers, O Christ, from swerving to the worse, by their closeness to you; for you are the source of goodness, who make good those who fittingly worship you.

Second Canon.

Why have you abandoned.

To Balaam the seer who of old do not believe the ineffable and divine marvels of God, the Angel, by appearing to the ass in the narrow lane, brought fearful reproof, and by showing the beast to be rational altered the signs of nature.

To Peter, imprisoned and waiting in gaol, God’s Angel appeared delivering him from Herod’s hands, and from bonds and from death; and so let us all honour the wise Archangels as God-inspired guardians of our souls.

Angels, Archangels, God’s divine Powers, abolish the upheavals of wars, and the heresies and all the scandals of the Church by your constant entreaties to God, and keep us in peace.

Ode 6.

Lord, you made Jonas dwell.

As befits God, O Lord, you brought out of nothing by your word the natures of the immortal, heavenly hosts, creating them with forms of light.

O Bodiless Powers, you have become honoured initiates of God’s praise, citizens of the heavenly and truly divine tabernacle, as you fittingly adore the Maker.

Son of God before all eternity, the spiritual ranks of the Bodiless ones praise you unceasingly, and glorify you as Maker and Creator of the universe.

O Immaculate, you were worthy to cradle in your arms the One who is seated eternally with the Father in the highest. Give him to us your servants, O Pure one, in your mercy.

Second Canon.

Be merciful to me.

Flying upward in mind from the corruption of matter, let us in fear with lips of matter honour in songs the immaterial Bodiless Powers as beings of fire and flame and light.

Put to death, O Archangels, the assaults of the passions, and with them bring to an end all the scandals of the faith, O Holy ones formed of fire, the Chief Captains of the Trinity.

Archangels of God, leaders of the Bodiless hosts, by your freedom to speak save us from every heresy, Michael the Prince and Gabriel, the Chief Captains.

****

Theotokion.

Willingly, O Christ, you appeared in flesh from a womb that did not know wedlock as God without flesh, but as man you bore flesh; the form of whose likeness we the faithful honour.

The Ikos.

You said in the Scriptures, Lover of mankind, that the multitudes of Angels rejoice in heaven over one human who repents, O Immortal; therefore we in our sins, O Sinless One, who alone know the heart, dare to implore you each day, for you are compassionate, to take pity on us, Master, and send us, the unworthy, compunction, granting us pardon; for they intercede for us all, the Chief Captains of the Bodiless Powers.

Verses.

Michael, a fitting song I wished to sing
You fittingly; but matter-free have none.
Leaders of heaven’s high host the eighth of November now honours.

For the Assembly of the Nine Orders of Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominations, Virtues, Principalities, Powers, Archangels and Angels.

****

Verses.

What offering worthy of the Orders nine
Could one the offspring of nine months pronounce?

Michael the pre-eminent Captain of the bodiless Powers, in both the Old Testament and the New Grace, has shown and shows to the human race his many graces and benefactions. For when the opponent and enemy of our salvation tossing his mane against the Creator, said swaggeringly: ‘I shall place my throne above the clouds’ and boastingly: ‘I shall be like the Most High’, he fell, as the Lord says, from his Archangel’s dignity. For he says: ‘I saw Satan falling from heaven like lightning.’ Moreover the bragging Order under him suffered the same fate. But all-honoured Michael, maintaining, as a faithful servant, his respect for the Master and showing his great care for our race was appointed by the Almighty to lead the spiritual and archangelic ranks. For when he saw the rebel fall, he assembled the choirs of Angels and saying: ‘Let us attend’ hymned aloud the Lord of all things, as though saying: ‘Let us, who are creatures, attend to what they have suffered who until now were with us, beings of light, but now have become darkness. This support then has been named the Assembly of the Angels, that is attention, agreement and unity.

This great champion then and benefactor of our salvation, abounding in and unfolding many saving acts of kindness, appears visibly to many. For he was seen by Abraham and Lot at the overthrow of Sodom. He appeared to Jacob as he fled from his brother. He marched at the head of the army of the children of Israel when they were being delivered and freed from the malice of the Egyptians. He appeared to Balaam as he went to curse Israel. To Jesus son of Navi when he inquired he said: ‘I the Chief Captain of the Lord have now come to you.’ He also diverted the rivers that had been released against the shrine and chapel by the impious. And many other stories are told of him in the inspired Scripture. Therefore we also, putting him forward as protector and guardian of our life, celebrate his present all-honoured festival, asking through his prayers and intercessions that we may find deliverance from troubles in this present age, and in the age to come that we may be found worthy of heaven’s grace and rank. Amen.

At the prayers of your Saints, O God, have mercy on us. Amen.

****

Ode 7. The Hebrew Youths.

Tens thousand ministering Angels stand unceasingly before him, unable to bear the sight of his countenance, as they cry: Blessed are you, Lord God!

You have shown, O Merciful, that the immaterial substances of the Angels are lights, filled with the ineffable light, who cry out unceasingly: Blessed are you, Lord God, to the ages.

Having created the multitude of Angels by your consubstantial Word, and hallowed them with the divine Spirit, you have taught them to praise the Trinity, God to the ages.

****

Triadikon.

Keeping in mind three Persons, we glorify an infinite Essence, the Father, the Son and the Spirit, as we cry out: Blessed are you, Lord God, to the ages.

****

Second Canon.

With choirs of Bodiless Powers, come race of mortals, let us clap our hands as we celebrate the auspicious day of the memorial of the wise Archangels of Christ, crying out: Blessed are you, O God of our Fathers.

Of old, as friends of strangers, Abraham who saw God and glorious Lot welcomed Angels and have found fellowship with Angels as they cry: O God of our Fathers, blessed are you.

Angels appeared to noble Manoe and to all-wise Tobit, bringing them the rewards of a worthy life; and the Angel of the three Youths once truly quenched the furnace’s flame of fire.

****

Theotokion.

Jesu, like the Fathers we proclaim that you took our whole nature from a Virgin without change, double in natures, but one in person; whose form we depict and faithfully reverence.

****

Katavasia.

The godlike Youths. ****

Ode 8. The Lord glorified.

Let us rival the Angels’ life and wing our minds on high, and immaterially raise the song with them, praising the Lord and highly exalting him to all the ages.

The Angels, worshippers of the heavenly choir, circling the throne of glory and ever wheeling about God, praise and highly exalt him to the ages.

The Trinity that makes a flame of fire those who minister unceasingly in the heights, and shows the Angels to be spirits, let us worship and glorify to all the ages.

****

Theotokion.

The One before whom in heaven tens of thousands of Angels and Archangels trembling stand you were worthy to carry in your arms; implore him, Mother of God, that we may be saved, who glorify him to the ages.

****

Second Canon.

Michael the Archangel is Prince of Angels; but resplendently glorified with him is the initiate of grace and the Virgin’s honoured suitor, the Captain of the Bodiless hosts, Gabriel who fittingly announces joy to those who cry: You people, highly exalt Christ to the ages.

Ezekiel saw the ranks of Angels in varied form and in his opening proclaimed: Among them stand the six-winged Seraphim, and the many-eyed Cherubim circle round. With them he saw the Archangels shining like amber as they glorified Christ to all the ages.

Daniel clearly foretold how fearful would be the arrival of your second coming down when he proclaimed how thrones were placed, and an Ancient took his seat; and he speaks of tens of thousands of Angels who stand around in fear and cry out to the Trinity with never silent voices to all the ages.

****

Theotokion.

The Word, consubstantial with the Father and the Spirit, willingly appeared from the Virgin with the same form as us, not mingling the elements of the dread union; for he is shown to be one in both, in the two natures and one person; the image of whose likeness we now worship.

****

Katavasia.

The Offspring of the Mother of God. ****

Ode 9.

Christ, who united the things of earth with those of heaven, and brought to completion one Church of Angels and of mortals, we unceasingly magnify you.

Angels and Archangels, Thrones, Virtues and Dominations, Principalities and Powers, Cherubim and Seraphim, with the Mother of God, intercede on behalf of the world.

Michael with Gabriel, shown as champions of all, watch over those who honour with longing and who hymn with faith your all-festive memory, and save them from every danger.

****

Theotokion.

O Virgin, you received the eternal Word, when he wished to refashion my nature, and you gave birth to him incarnate; therefore, Mother of God, we unceasingly magnify you.

****

Second Canon.

First of the Bodiless ones, Michael and Gabriel, you have appeared as champions for the salvation of those in sickness and on sea, and of those in need.

Dancing with the choirs of Powers and Thrones, as Captain of the Angels and initiate of God, O Gabriel, intercede for us to the Saviour.

As guardians of the world and of the Church, and Commanders of the Powers on high, implore the Saviour on our behalf.

****

Theotokion.

Harmoniously, Mother of God, we glorify you, for you deliver us from passions and from dangers, and you fulfil our entreaties for good things.

****

Katavasia

. Let all those born of earth. ****

Exapostilarion.

The Maker and God has proclaimed you as champion, governor and provider for our mortal race, O godlike Chief Captain, and has honoured you ineffably with glory, ceaselessly to sound the thrice-holy and divine hymn of victory.

****

Another.

Inexpressibly aflame with the divine rays of the Trinity beyond light, you pass through all creation as lightning, fulfilling God’s behest, Archangel Michael, lightning-formed, guarding, protecting and sheltering those who radiantly sing your praise.

****

Another.

O glorious Michael, godlike Chief Captain, you have been placed by God as leader of Virtues, Powers, Archangels, Angels, Dominations, Thrones and Principalities; as you stand before the unendurable throne, shelter, guard, protect and save those who in faith honour you, the world’s defender.

****

Theotokion.

You are greater in honour than the glorious Cherubim, O Al-praised, and beyond compare more glorious than the dread Seraphim, and holier than all the Holy Angels, O All-pure, for inexpressibly you gave birth to the Creator of all things in a body, O Mother of God. Ask him to give your servants deliverance from offences.

****

At Lauds we insert 4 Verses and we sing 3 Prosomia, doubling the first.

Tone 1. Joy of the heavenly hosts.

Michael, we faithfully sing your praise as Chief Captain of the heavenly orders, and mighty champion, guard and deliverer of those on earth, beseeching you to deliver us from every destroying pain.

The leader of the godlike Powers above invites the choirs of mortals today to celebrate with the Angels one shining feast of their Assembly and together raise the thrice-holy hymn to God.

Michael, godlike spirit, guard and shelter in this life beneath the shelter of your godlike wings us who flee to you in faith, and at the hour of death, Archangel, be present as most kindly helper for us all.

Glory.

**Tone 5.**

Where your grace casts its shade, Archangel, there the devil’s power is chased away; for the fallen Morning Star cannot endure in your light. And so we ask you, quench his fiery darts, directed against us, delivering us by your mediation, from his traps, Michael Archangel, worthy of praise.

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Virgin Mother of God, we the faithful as is fitting call you blessed, and we glorify you, the impregnable city, the unbreachable wall, the unshakeable protection and refuge of our souls.

**SELECTION FOR THE POLYELEOS**

FOR THE ASSEMBLY OF THE ARCHANGELS MICHAEL AND GABRIEL
AND ALL THE HEAVENLY POWERS.

I shall sing to you, Alleluia.

I shall give thanks to you, O Lord, with my whole heart and in the presence of Angels I shall sing to you.

Who makes spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers.

Who walks on the wings of the winds.

Bless the Lord all his Angels.

Mighty in strength, who perform his word.

Bless the Lord all his Powers, his Ministers who do his will.

He is seated on the Cherubim, let the earth be shaken.

All you his Angels worship him.

For he has commanded his Angels concerning you, to protect you in all your ways.

They will bear you in their hands, lest you strike your foot against a stone.

You who are seated on the Cherubim shine forth before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasse.

The Angel of the Lord will surround those who fear him and will deliver them.

By the word of the Lord the heavens were established.

And by the breath of his mouth all their power.

And he mounted upon Cherubim and flew, he flew on the wings of the wind.

You have made him little less than the Angels.

You have crowned him with glory and honour.

He sent out his Angel and took me from my father’s sheep.

Bless the Lord, my soul, O Lord my God you are greatly magnified.

Praise the Lord from heaven, praise him in the heights.

Praise him all his Angels, praise him all his Powers, to you praise is due, O God..

Glory, Both now. Alleluia.

Glory.

Let us worship the Father, and let us glorify the Son, and let us all praise together the all holy Spirit, crying out and saying: All holy Trinity, save us all.

Both now.

Your people, O Christ, brings your Mother to intercede; at her entreaties grant us your pity, that we may glorify you, O Good one, who dawned for us from the grave.
