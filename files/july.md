**MONTH OF JULY**
=================

(**Having 31 days. The day has 14 hours and the night 10)**

**1. Of the holy Unmercenary wonderworkers, Cosmas and Damian of Rome.**

These, who are different from those who are celebrated on the 1st of November, were from Rome, and were doctors by profession. They cured both men and animals for nothing and asked no other payment except confession of Christ and faith from those who were cured. They died as martyrs in 284 under Carinus and Nomerianus.

**Permission for wine and oil.**

**Apolytikion. Tone 8.**

Holy Unmercenaries and wonderworkers, visit our infirmities; freely you received, freely give to us.

**Kontakion. Tone 2.**

Glorious, wonder-working Doctors, you received the grace of healings and you extend strength to those in need; but by your visitation cast down the insolence of our enemies, healing the world by your wonders.

**2. The deposition of the precious Robe of our most holy Lady the Mother of God in Blachernae.**

The deposition took place in 473, in the reign of Leo the Thracian, in the magnificent temple of the Mother of God in Blachernae, which was built, according to some, by the same Leo, but, according to others, by his predecessors Marcian and Pulcheria. The emperor Justin the younger completed the temple, which the emperor Romanos Argyros rebuilt after it had been destroyed by fire in 1070. It was burnt down again in 1434 and from then there remained a small shrine with the celebrated holy spring, until in 1869 a beautiful little church was once again erected there, which is still visible to-day. The name Blachernae was given after the 7th century to other temples and monasteries also by their devout founders because of their devotion to this famous temple in Constantinople.

**Permission for wine and oil.**

**Apolytikion. Tone 8.**

Ever-virgin Mother of God, you gave the Robe and Girdle of your immaculate body as a mighty rampart for your city; by your child-bearing without seed they have remained incorrupt; for in you nature and time are made new. Therefore we beseech you to give peace to your commonwealth and to our souls great mercy.

**Kontakion. Tone 4..**

O Pure one, full of God’s grace, you have given your sacred Robe as a rampart of incorruption to all the faithful; with it you covered your sacred body, O divine protection of mankind. We celebrate its deposition with love, and with shouts we faithfully cry aloud: Hail Virgin, boast of Christians!

**3. Of the holy martyr Hyacinth; and of our Father among the Saints Anatolios, Archbishop of Constantinople.**

The martyr was from Caesarea in Cappadocia, a valet (cubicularius) of the emperor Trajan. When constrained by him to eat meat offered to idols he was unwilling to do so and was shut up in prison without food, where he committed his spirit to God in the year 108.

The Hierarch was formerly a presbyter of the Church of Alexandria, then he succeeded St Flavian as archbishop of Constantinople in 449. He was present at the 4th General Council at Chalcedon and died in 458. The Stichera entitled ‘Anatolika’ (rather ‘anatoliaka’) in the Octoichos at Vespers and Lauds some attribute to this Anatolios, while others (and perhaps more probably) to another of the same name from the monastery of Studios, a disciple of St Theodore the Studite, one of whose letters to whom has been preserved.

**Apolytikia: Of the Martyr. Tone 4.**

Your Martyr, O Lord, by his struggle obtained the crown of incorruption from You, our God; for with your might he destroyed tyrants, and shattered the feeble insolence of the demons: at his prayers, O Christ God, save our souls.

**Of the Bishop. Tone 4.**

The truth of your actions proclaimed you to your flock as a rule of faith, an image of meekness and a teacher of self-control; and so you gained through humility the things on high, through poverty riches, O Father and high priest Anatolios; intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.

**4. Of our father among the Saints Andrew of Jerusalem, archbishop of Crete.**

He was from Damascus, son of George and Gregoria. He joined the clergy and became secretary to Theodore, patriarch of Jerusalem, whence he acquired the surname Jerusalemite. He was present at the 6th General Council, the second which was summoned in Constantinople, in 680 in the reign of Constantine the Bearded. He became deacon of the Great Church, that is of Haghia Sophia and then archbishop of Crete. He died in 720 or 723. In addition to his other sacred writings he also composed various hymns, among which was that called the Great Canon, which was perhaps the first so composed for Christ’s Church.

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

The truth of your actions proclaimed you to your flock as a rule of faith, an image of meekness and a teacher of self-control; and so you gained through humility the things on high, through poverty riches, Father and high priest Andrew; intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.

**Kontakion. Tone 2.**

You sounded clearly the trumpet of divine songs; you were revealed as a brilliant beacon to the world, shining with the light of the Trinity, venerable Andrew; therefore we all cry out to you: Do not cease to intercede for us all.

**5. Of our venerable Fathers Athanasios of Athos and Lampadis the wonderworker.**

The venerable Athanasios was a native of Trebizond. He first lived as a monk on the mountain called Kymaios or Kyminas, of Mysia in Bithynia. Later he moved to Mt Athos where he established the largest monastery, known to-day by his name, and called Lavra. He died around the end of the tenth century.

**Apolytikion. Tone 3.**

The ranks of Angels were amazed at your life in the flesh, O all-famed, how you wrestled with invisible foes and defeated the regiments of the demons; therefore, Athanasios, Christ rewarded you with rich gifts; and so, Father, intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.

**Kontakion. Tone 2.**

Taking up the yoke of Christ and laying your cross upon your shoulders, Athanasios, you became an outstanding imitator of his sufferings and a companion of his glory, sharing in divine and unending delight.

**6. Of our venerable father Sisoë the Great.**

**Apolytikion. Tone 1.**

Citizen of the desert and Angel embodied, and wonder-worker you have been declared, O God-bearing father Sisoë; by fasting and by vigil and by prayers, receiving gifts of grace from heaven, you heal the sick and the souls of those who have recourse to you in faith. Glory to him who gave you strength! Glory to him who crowned you! Glory to him who through you works healing for all!

**Kontakion. Tone 4.**

You appeared on earth like an angel by your ascetic life, lighting the minds of the faithful with miracles at every moment ; therefore, venerable Sisoë, in faith we honour you.

**7. Of our venerable father Thomas of Malaion and of the holy great martyr Kyriaki.**

She was the daughter of Christian parents, Dorotheos and Evsevia. As she was born on the Lord’s day she was named Kyriaki \[Sunday\]. She was martyred at Nikomedia under Diocletian in the year 282.

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

O Jesu, your lamb cries aloud: O my Bridegroom, I long for you; and seeking you I struggle, and I am crucified and buried with you in your baptism; and I suffer for your sake, that I may reign with you; and I die for you, that I may live in you; but as a spotless victim now accept one who with longing is slain for you. Through her prayers, as you are merciful, save our souls!

**Kontakion. Tone 2.**

Christ’s Martyr has now called us together to celebrate in songs of praise her godly struggles and contests; for valiant in thought she, like her name, appeared as mistress of her mind and of unseemly passions.

**8. Of the holy great martyr Prokopios.**

He was martyred in 290 in the reign of Diocletian at Caesarea in Palestine.

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

Your Martyr, O Lord, by his struggle obtained the crown of incorruption from you, our God; for with your might he destroyed tyrants, and shattered the feeble insolence of the demons: at his prayers, O Christ God, save our souls.

**Kontakion. Tone 2.**

On fire with the godly zeal of Christ and armoured with the strength of the Cross, Prokopios, you destroyed the arrogance and insolence of the foe and you exalted the Church by advancing with faith and bringing us light.

**9. Of the holy bishop and martyr Pankratios, bishop of Tauromenium in Sicily.**

He was a contemporary of the Apostles, a native of Antioch, and was brought to faith in Christ by Peter, the prince of the Apostles.

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

You shared their way of life and you succeeded to the Apostles**’** thrones; you found the practice, O God-inspired, to climb the heights of contemplation; rightly proclaiming the word of truth; and in faith you struggled to shedding of blood, Bishop and Martyr Pankratios; intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.

**10. Of the Forty Five holy martyrs of Nikopolis in Armenia.**

They were martyred under Licinius in 315.

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

Your Martyrs, O Lord, by their struggles obtained the crowns of incorruption from you, our God; for with your might they destroyed tyrants, and shattered the feeble insolence of the demons: at their prayers, O Christ God, save our souls.

**11. Of the holy great martyr and all-praised Efphemia, when she confirmed the Definition of the Faith.**

In the year 451, under the rulers Marcian and Pulcheria, the 4th General Council was summoned in Chalcedon against the monophysites Eftyches and Dioskoros. After lengthy debates the 630 fathers who championed Orthodoxy and those who followed the opposite view agreed that each side would write its Definition, that is their doctrine of the faith and their opinion of the submitted proposition, in separate books and ask from God the verdict on them. When they had done this they placed the two tomes (books) in the coffin which contained the relics of St Efphemia and having sealed it they went away. After holding all-night vigils of intercession for three days they opened it in the presence of the Emperor and found the tome of the heretics at the Martyr’s feet, while that of the Orthodox was grasped in her right hand. On the subject of this martyr, see September 16.

**Apolytikion. Tone 3.**

You filled the Orthodox with joy and shamed the defenders of error, Efphemia, fair virgin of Christ; for you confirmed what the Fathers of the Fourth Council had correctly taught. Glorious martyr, implore Christ God to grant us his great mercy.

**Kontakion. Tone 6.**

For Christ your bridegroom you mastered combats by struggle and combats by the faith. But now too intercede through the Mother of God that heresies and the horde of barbarians may be subjected beneath the feet of our Kings, All-praised Martyr, who received and guarded the Definition by the six hundred and thirty god-bearing Fathers.

**12. Of the holy martyrs Proclus and Hilarios.**

They suffered in the year 106 at Ankyra in the reign of Trajan.

**13. The assembly of the Archangel Gabriel; and commemoration of our venerable father Stephen the Sabbaite.**

Concerning the latter see October 28th.

**Apolytikia: of the Archangel. Tone 4.**

Chief Captain of the heavenly armies, we the unworthy ever implore you to wall us about with your prayers, as you guard in the shelter of the wings of your immaterial glory us who fall before you and earnestly cry out: Deliver us from dangers, as General of Powers above.

**Of the Monk. Tome 8.**

Orthodoxy’s guide, teacher of piety and reverence, beacon of the world, fair ornament of monks, inspired by God, O wise Stephen, by your teaching you have enlightened all, O harp of the Spirit; intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.

**Kontakion of the Archangel. Tone 4.**

As leader of the bodiless ministers you, Gabriel, believed the great mystery truly defined before the ages, the ineffable child-bearing of the holy Virgin, when you addressed her: Hail, Full of grace. Therefore as is fitting we faithful with gladness ever call you blest.

**Note**

**On the 13th of this month, if it falls on a Sunday, or on the first Sunday after it, there is sung the office of the holy and god-bearing Fathers who took part in the six General Councils; that is to say, the 318 at the 1st in Nicea, the 150 at the 2nd in Constantinople, the 200 at the 3rd in Ephesus, the 630 at the 4th in Chalcedon, the 165 at the 5th, the second in Constantinople, and the 170 at the 6th, the third in Constantinople.**

**Note that the writer of the Synaxarion for this Sunday only mentions the 4th Council; and that likewise the office sung on it treats only of the 4th and 6th, gathered against the Monophysites and the Monothelites, not of the other four.**

**Apolytikia: of the Resurrection in the Tone.**

**Another, of the Fathers. Tone 8.**

You are glorified above all, Christ our God, who established our fathers as beacons on the earth, and through them guided us all to the true faith: O greatly compassionate, glory to you!

**Kontakion. Tone 8.**

The preaching of the Apostles and the teachings of the Fathers sealed for the Church the faith as one; and wearing a tunic of the truth, woven from the theology above she rightly defines and glorifies the great Mystery of true religion.

**14. Of the holy apostle Aquila; and of our father among the saints Joseph, archbishop of Thessaloniki; and of our venerable father Nikodemos of the Holy Mountain, the Teacher.**

Aquila was from Pontus in Asia Minor, a Jew by race, a tentmaker by trade. He happened to be at Corinth with his wife Priscilla in the year 52, when Paul first came there. He gave him hospitality and the apostle stayed with them for many days working himself at the same trade (Acts 18:2-3). Through Paul they came to believe in Christ and they followed him from then on, co-operating with him and enduring dangers with him for the preaching of the Gospel, as he testifies himself in the epistle to the Romans, where he says, ‘Greet Priscilla and Aquila my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, who risked their necks on my behalf’ etc. (16:2-4).When and where they died is uncertain.

Joseph was the brother of Theodore the Studite (Nov.11th), and he is often called a Studite himself, especially when he is mentioned along with his brother. The two of them together composed the canons of the Triodion, according to Kodinos, in the period of Leo the Armenian, as they sat in the church of St Romanos (Nov.18th). After becoming archbishop of Thessaloniki he was exiled two or times on account of his devout zeal for the honour of the holy images; and when he had suffered greatly he died in exile.

**15. Of the holy martyrs Kirykos and Julitta.**

She lived in the time of Diocletian and was from the city of Iconium. Frightened by the persecution that was then raging she took her three year old son Kirykos and left for Selefkia; but when she found the same terrible danger there she made for Tarsus in Cilicia. There the governor arrested her and taking the child away he endeavoured by spoiling him to lure him to himself. But he, lisping and calling on the name of Christ, kicked the governor as hard as he could in the stomach. Enraged at this the governor threw him down the steps of the tribunal. The child, his head smashed in, yielded up his spirit. His blest mother, after enduring many tortures was finally beheaded, in the year 296.

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

Your Martyrs, O Lord, by their struggle obtained the crowns of incorruption from you, our God; for with your might they destroyed tyrants, and shattered the feeble insolence of the demons: at their prayers, O Christ God, save our souls.

**Kontakion. Tone 4.**

Christ’s martyr Julitta, bearing Kirykos in her arms in the stadium like a mother, cried out with joy: You are strength of the Martyrs, O Christ!

**16. Of the holy bishop and martyr Athenogenes.**

He was from Sevasteia in Cappadocia. According to the writer of the synaxarion he became bishop of Pidachthoes (perhaps of Pida and Chloe, cities of Galatian Cappadocia, under the metropolitan of Sevasteia. He was martyred by fire under Diocletian in 200, when, as he departed for the fire which had been made ready for him, he sang, so they say, the ‘O Joyful Light’ as a hymn to the holy Trinity (cf. March 11th).

**17. Of the holy great martyr Marina.**

She lived in the time of Claudius and was from Pisidia in Cilicia, the only daughter of a pagan priest. Orphaned of her mother she was entrusted to another woman and was taught by her the faith in Christ. At the age of fifteen she was arrested by the governor and on being asked her name, country and faith she answered, ‘I am called Marina; by birth and nurture I am of Pisidia; and I call upon the name of my Lord, Jesus Christ’. After this she endured bonds and prisons and many tortures, and was finally beheaded in the year 270.

**Permission for wine and oil.**

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

O Jesu, your lamb cries aloud: O my Bridegroom, I long for you; and seeking you I struggle, and I am crucified and buried with you in your baptism; and I suffer for your sake, that I may reign with you; and I die for you, that I may live in you; but as a spotless victim now accept one who with longing is slain for you. Through her prayers, as you are merciful, save our souls!

**Kontakion. Tone 3.**

Virgin and Martyr Marina, you were adorned with the beauty of virginity and crowned with the tokens of martyrdom, sprinkled with the blood of the contest and radiant with wonders of healings; devoutly you received the prize of your contest.

**18. Of the holy martyr Aimilianos.**

**19. Of our venerable mother Macrina, sister of Basil the Great; and of our venerable father Dios.**

**Apolytikia; Of St Macrina. Tone 8.**

In you, Mother, was preserved unimpaired that which is according to the image, for you took up the cross, and you followed Christ; and by your deeds you have taught us to despise the flesh, for it passes away; but to care for the soul, which is a thing immortal; and therefore your spirit, holy Macrina, rejoices with the Angels.

**Of St Dios. Tone 1.**

Citizen of the desert and Angel embodied, and wonder-worker you have been declared, O God-bearing father Dios; by fasting and by vigil and by prayers, receiving gifts of grace from heaven, you heal the sick and the souls of those who have recourse to you in faith. Glory to him who gave you strength! Glory to him who crowned you! Glory to him who through you works healing for all!

**20. Of the holy and glorious prophet Elias the Thesbite.**

The great Elias was from Thisbe or Thesbe, a city of Galaad, beyond Jordan, from a priestly family, a man of the desert and of ascetic character, clothed in a melote (a sheepskin) and wearing a leather belt around his loins. His name means ’The Lord is God’ or ’The Lord is strong’. His zeal for the glory of God is compared to fire and his word for instruction and rebuke to a burning torch; hence he acquired the surname ’Zealot’. He it was, on fire with this zeal, who severely rebuked the godlessness and iniquity of king Achab and his wife Jezabel. Through prayer he shut up heaven and it did not rain for three years and six months. Ravens brought him the food he needed when he was in hiding by God’s command near the brook Chorrath. He multiplied the small supply of oil and flour of a poor widow woman of Sareptha, who had welcomed him into her house, and he raised to life her son who had died. He brought down fire from heaven on Mount Carmel and it burned up the sacrifice to his God before all Israel for a demonstration of the truth. He slaughtered at the brook Kisson the 450 false prophets, the priests who worshipped idols and led the people astray. He received food miraculously at the hands of an Angel and by that food he was given power to journey for forty days and forty nights. He saw God on Mount Horeb, as far as it is possible for human nature. He foretold the catastrophe of the house of Achab and the death of his son Ozochias, and he burned as a punishment two captains of fifty sent to him by the latter by twice calling down fire from heaven. He parted the stream of Jordan and crossed with his disciple Elisaius on dry land; finally as he was talking with him he was suddenly snatched up by a fiery chariot, in the year 895 BC., and was taken up into heaven, wither he was translated by God alive, lust like Enoch (Gen.5:24, IV Kingd.2:11). But later on, after seven years, he rebuked Joram the son of Josaphat in a letter, as it is written: And there came to him (Joram) in a letter from the prophet Elias saying; Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father: In that you have not walked etc. (II Chron.21:12). He sent it, in the opinion of the majority of exegetes, either by the hand of his disciple Elisaius or some other prophet, to whom he appeared just as did on Mount Thabor to the disciples of Christ (August 6th).

**No work and permission for wine and oil.**

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

The angel embodied, the Prophets’ foundation, the second forerunner of the coming of Christ, Elias the glorious by sending down grace from on high to Elisaius drives out diseases, cleanses lepers; and so he overflows with healings for those who honour him.

**Kontakion. Tone 2. Model melody.**

Glorious Elias, foreteller and foreseer of God’**s** mighty works , who in your fierce anger stopped the rain-shedding clouds, intercede on our behalf with the only lover of mankind.

**Of Saints Alexis Medvedkov, Dimitri Klepinine, Maria Skobtsova, Yuri Skobtsov,  Elie Fondaminskii **

For an account of their canonisation by the Patriarchate of Constantinople go to the following link:[http://www.incommunion.org/canonization.htm](/canonization.md). This contains a number of links to pages containing a great deal of interesting material about Saint Maria and her Companions. The Patriarchate has not yet, so far as I am aware, issued official liturgical texts for these Saints and so the General Menaion should be used.

**21. Of our venerable fathers Symeon the fool in Christ and John his fellow ascetic.**

They were from Edessa in Mesopotamia in the reign of Justin the Younger. Others say that Symeon that Symeon first spent twenty nine years in a hermitage and then departed from Emesa in Syria where he spent the rest of his life acting as a fool and died in 570.

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

God of our Fathers, who always deal with us in your your forbearance, do not deprive us of your mercy, but at their intercessions guide our life in peace.

**Kontakion. Tone 2.**

With faith and love let us praise the God-bearing Symeon, equal of the Angels, who was revealed while in the flesh as out of the flesh and shining with more than worldly virtues, and with him honoured John, as ones who intercede unceasingly to the Lord on behalf of us all.

**22. Of the holy Myrrhbearer and equal of the Apostles Mary Magdalen.**

She was from a town in Galilee on the sea of Tiberias named Magdala, whence she has the surname Magdalen. After Jesus had cast out the seven demons from which she had previously suffered she became his faithful and inseparable disciple, following Him and serving Him to the Cross and the Tomb. She then returned to Jerusalem with the other Myrrhbearers and they prepared spices to anoint the Lord’s body. On the Sunday very early in the morning they went to the sepulchre and before the Angels had yet appeared to reveal the Lord’s resurrection the Magdalen had seen the stone rolled away from the sepulchre and run and told Peter and John. She returned at once to the sepulchre and as she stood weeping outside it she was allowed to be the first to see the Lord risen from the dead. When she fell at his feet she heard the words: Do not touch me. After the Lord’s assumption everything about her is uncertain. Some say that she died in Ephesus, where she had preached Christ.

**Permission for wine and oil.**

**Apolytikion. Tone 1.**

Holy Mary Magdalen, you followed Christ, who was born for us from a Virgin, and you kept his statutes and his laws; therefore today, as we feast your all-holy memory, we receive release from sins at your prayers.

**Kontakion. Tone 4.**

The God who is above all being, while living in the flesh in the world, gained you as his true disciple, O Myrrhbearer, and all your desire was directed to him; therefore you accomplished many healings and now that you have passed over into heaven you intercede at every moment for the world.

**23. Of the holy bishop and martyr Phokas; and of the holy prophet Ezekiel.**

Concerning the bishop and martyr see September 22nd. The Prophet was the son of Buzi and a priest by rank. He was taken as a captive to Babylon in the reign of Joachim (Jechonias). In the fifth year of the captivity, around 593 or 594 BC, he started to prophesy. The many symbolic actions which were ordered him by God gave incitement to the most disgraceful mockeries to those who spoke endlessly against the sacred cult. He prophesied for about twenty years and was murdered, so they say, by a Jewish leader because he had rebuked for his idolatry. His prophecy is divided into forty eight chapters and comes third among the major Prophets.

**Apolytikia: of the Bishop. Tone 4.**

You shared their way of life and you succeeded to the Apostles’ thrones; you found the practice, O God-inspired, to climb the heights of contemplation; rightly proclaiming the word of truth; and in faith you struggled to shedding of blood, Bishop and Martyr Phokas; intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.

**Of the Prophet. Tone 2.**

As we celebrate the memory of your Prophet Ezekiel, O Lord, through him we beseech you: Save our souls.

**24. Of the holy great martyr Christina.**

She was martyred in the year 200 in the reign of Severus at Tyre.

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

O Jesu, your lamb cries aloud: O my Bridegroom, I long for you; and seeking you I struggle, and I am crucified and buried with you in your baptism; and I suffer for your sake, that I may reign with you; and I die for you, that I may live in you; but as a spotless victim now accept one who with longing is slain for you. Through her prayers, as you are merciful, save our souls!

**Kontakion. Tone 4.**

You appeared as a shining dove with wings of gold, and you came to rest on the heights of heaven, honoured Christina; therefore we celebrate your glorious festival as we venerate with faith the casket of your relics, from which there truly flows for all divine healing of soul and body.

**25. The dormition of Saint Anne, mother of the Mother of God.**

According to tradition Anne, the grandmother of God, lived for 69 years and her husband Joachim for 80. As to which of them died first we have no information; only that the Mother of God was an orphan of both her parents in her eleventh year, when she was living in the temple. See November 21st and September 8th.

**Permission for wine and oil.**

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

You bore in your womb, inspired Anne, her who bore life, the pure Mother of God; and so now you have passed over rejoicing to a heavenly inheritance, where those who are glad have their dwelling in glory, as you ask pardon of offences, O ever-blessed, for those who honour you with love.

**Kontakion. Tone 2.**

Let us celebrate the memory of the grandparents of Christ as with faith we ask their help that all those may be delivered from every trouble who cry: O God be with us, who have glorified them as you were well-pleased.

**26. Of the holy bishop and martyr Hermolaos and of his fellow martyrs Hermippos and Hermocrates; and of the holy virgin martyr Paraskevi \[Friday\].**

Hermolaos and his companions were priests of the Church in Nikomedia; they were martyred under Maximianus in the year 306. Paraskevi was from a village of Rome, daughter of devout parents Agathon and Politeia. She was born on a Friday, hence her name. From childhood she was taught the sacred writings and devoted herself to the study of the holy Scriptures while leading a monastic life and guiding many to the faith of Christ. In the days of the Emperor Antoninus Pius she was arrested for this and urged to worship the idols, but she answered in the words of the prophet Jeremy: The gods who did not make the heaven and the earth, let them perish from the earth (10:11). After undergoing frightful tortures she was finally beheaded, in the year 140.

**Permission for wine and oil.**

**Apolytikia: of the Martyrs. Tone 4.**

Your Martyrs, O Lord, by their struggles obtained the crowns of incorruption from you, our God; for with your might they destroyed tyrants, and shattered the feeble insolence of the demons: at their prayers, O Christ God, save our souls.

**Of St Paraskevi. Tone 1.**

Well-named you practised a zeal appropriate to your name, and have inherited for your dwelling the faith that shares your name, O Champion Paraskevi; therefore you pour forth healings and intercede for our souls.

**Kontakion. Tone 8.**

Come, let us the faithful raise in harmony a hymn of praise to Paraskevi; for she blazes with wonders in the world, driving out the dark folly of error and granting unstinted grace to the faithful who cry: Hail, Martyr of many struggles!

**27. Of the holy great martyr and healer Panteleimon.**

He was from Nikomedia, son of Efstorgos and Evbouli. His father was an idolater but his mother was of Christian ancestry. By her he was guided to the true religion and he was instructed in the faith of Christ and baptised by the above mentioned Hermolaos (cf. the 26th). After being taught the art of medicine he practised it with love for mankind, healing by the grace of Christ rather than by his skill, and displaying with sympathy every care of souls and bodies to all, as a result he was suitably renamed Panteleimon instead of Pantoleon, which he had been called previously. Once when he had opened the eyes of a blind man by the invocation of the divine name, he also enlightened the eyes of his soul to an understanding of the truth, and this was the cause of his martyrdom. When the man who had been blind was asked by some one how his eyes had been opened he confessed with boldness just like the blind man in the gospel both the physician and the manner of his healing. He was at once slain, while Panteleimon was arrested and having undergone many scourgings he was finally beheaded in the year 305 in the reign of Maximianus.

**Permission for wine and oil.**

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

Holy Champion and healer Panteleimon, intercede with the merciful God to grant our souls forgiveness of faults.

**Kontakion. Tone 5. Model melody.**

Imitator of the Merciful, who have received from him the grace of healings, Champion and Martyr of Christ God, by your prayers cure the diseases of our souls, chase away the stumbling blocks of the eternal enemy from those who ceaselessly cry out: Save us, O Lord!

**28. Of the holy apostles and deacons Prochoros, Nikanor, Timon and Parmenas.**

**Apolytikion. Tone 3.**

O holy Apostles, intercede with the merciful God to grant our souls forgiveness of sins.

**Kontakion. Tone 1.**

You were revealed by faith as honoured deacons, eye-witnesses of the Word and vessels of election, Nikanor and Prochoros, Parmenas, glorious Timon; therefore today we feast your sacred memory as with gladness of heart we call you blessed.

**29. Of the holy martyr Kallinikos; and of the holy martyr Theodoti.**

**Apolytikia: of St Kallinikos. Tone 4.**

Your Martyr, O Lord, by his struggle obtained the crown of incorruption from you, our God; for with your might he destroyed tyrants, and shattered the feeble insolence of the demons: at his prayers, O Christ God, save our souls.

**Of St Theodoti. Tone 4.**

O Jesu, your lamb cries aloud: O my Bridegroom, I long for you; and seeking you I struggle, and I am crucified and buried with you in your baptism; and I suffer for your sake, that I may reign with you; and I die for you, that I may live in you; but as a spotless victim now accept one who with longing is slain for you. Through her prayers, as you are merciful, save our souls!
