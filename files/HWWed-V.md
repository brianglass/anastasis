ON HOLY AND GREAT WEDNESDAY

VESPERS

****

The priest gives the blessing:

Blessed is the Kingdom of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and always, and to ages of ages.

****

The appointed monk or the Superior reads the Opening Psalm as follows:

Amen. Come let us worship and fall down before the King, our God.
Come let us worship and fall down before Christ the King, our God.
Come let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King and our God.

****

Psalm 103

Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you have been greatly magnified. You have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his upper chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind, making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle; waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at the voice of your thunder. The mountains rise and the plains descend to the place which you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await them to quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling: and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human heart. The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There the sparrows will build their nests; the heron’s dwelling is at their head. The high mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night, in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they will lie down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth has been filled with your creation. Also this great, wide sea; there there are creeping things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go to and fro; this dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to you to give them their food in due season. When you give it them, they will gather it. When you open your hand all things will be filled with goodness. But when you turn away your face they will be troubled. You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust. You will send forth your spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of the earth. May the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his works. He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. May my words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no more. Bless the Lord, my soul! ****

And again

The sun knew the hour of its setting: you made darkness, and it was night. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all!

Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.
Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to you, O God. (

KATHISMA EIGHTEEN

****

Psalm 119
A Song of Ascents.

When I was afflicted I called to the Lord, and he heard me. O Lord, deliver my soul from unjust lips and from a deceitful tongue. What should be given you, what added to you for a treacherous tongue? The sharpened arrows of the powerful, with the coals of desolation. Alas! For my sojourning has been prolonged, I have camped among the encampments of Kedar. My soul has long been a sojourner. With those who hate peace I was peaceable. When I spoke with them, they made war on me for nothing.

****

Psalm 120
A Song of Ascents.

I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains. From where will my help come? My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. Do not let your foot waver. May the One who guards you not slumber. See, the One who guards Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord will guard you; the Lord is protection for you on your right hand. By day the sun will not scorch you, nor the moon by night. The Lord will guard you from every evil, the Lord will guard your soul. The Lord will guard your coming in, and your going out, from now and for ever more.

****

Psalm 121
A Song of Ascents.

I rejoiced at those who said to me, ‘We shall go to the house of the Lord’. Our feet were standing in your courts, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem built as a city, shared by all together. For there the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord. For there thrones were set for judgement, thrones over the house of David. Ask then for the things which are for Jerusalem’s peace, and prosperity for those who love you. May there be peace then in your power and prosperity in your citadels. For the sake of my brethren and neighbours, I have spoken peace concerning you. For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I have sought good things for you.

****

Psalm 122

A Song of Ascents.

I have lifted my eyes to you who dwell in heaven. Behold, as the eyes of servants look to their lords’ hands, as the eyes of a maid to her mistress’s hands, so do our eyes to the Lord our God, until he take pity on us. Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us, for we have had our fill of contempt, our soul has been filled to overflowing. Let reproach be for the prosperous, and contempt for the proud.

****

Psalm 123
A Song of Ascents.

If the Lord had not been among us, let Israel now say; if the Lord had not been among us when people rose up against us, they would have swallowed us down alive. When their fury raged against us, the water would have drowned us, our soul would have passed through the torrent, our soul would have passed through irresistible water. Blessed is the Lord, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul was delivered like a sparrow from the snare of the hunters. The snare was shattered, and we were delivered. Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

Psalm 124
A Song of Ascents.

Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Sion. One who dwells in Jerusalem will be shaken for ever. Mountains encircle her, and the Lord encircles his people from now and for ever. For the Lord will not leave the rod of sinners upon the heritage of the just, lest the just stretch out their hands in iniquities. Do good, Lord, to the good and to the upright in heart. But the Lord will drive away with those who work iniquity, those who turn aside to extortions. Peace upon Israel.

****

Psalm 125
A Song of Ascents.

When the Lord turned back the captivity of Sion, we became like those who are comforted. Then our mouth was filled with joy, and our tongue with rejoicing. Then they will say among the nations, ‘The Lord has done great things with them’. The Lord has done great things with us, we have become joyful. Turn back our captivity, O Lord, like streams in the south. Those who sow in tears, will reap in joy. They went, and as they went they wept, while they sowed their seed. But when they come, they will come in joy, carrying their sheaves.

****

Psalm 126
A Song of Ascents.

If the Lord does not build the house, the builders have toiled for nothing. If the Lord does not guard the city, the guard has kept vigil for nothing. Your getting up at dawn is for nothing, your rising after sitting, you that eat the bread of sorrow, when he gives sleep to those he loves, see, sons are the Lord’s inheritance, the reward of the fruit of the womb. As arrows in the hand of a powerful man, so are the sons of the rejected. Blessed is one who satisfies his desire with them. They will not be shamed when they speak with their enemies in the gates.

****

Psalm 127
A Song of Ascents.

Blessed are all who fear the Lord, who walk in his ways. You will eat the toils of your fruits. You are blest, and it will be well with you. Your wife like a luxuriant vine against the sides of your house; your sons like new olive shoots around your table. See, that is how one who fears the Lord will be blessed. The Lord bless you from Sion, and may you see the good things of Jerusalem all the days of your life. And may you see your children’s children. Peace upon Israel.

****

Psalm 128
A Song of Ascents.

Many times they have made war on me since my youth, let Israel now say. Many times they have made war on me since my youth, and yet they have not prevailed over me. The sinners have wrought upon my back, they have prolonged their iniquity. The Lord is just, he has broken the sinners’ necks. Let all those who hate Sion be shamed and turned back. Let them become like grass on the housetops, which withers before it is uprooted. The reaper has not filled his hand with it, nor the one who gathers the sheaves his bosom. Nor have the passers-by said, ‘The Lord’s blessing be on you. We have blessed you in the name of the Lord’.

Psalm 129
A Song of Ascents

Out of the depths I have cried to you, O Lord. Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication. If you note our iniquities, Lord, Lord, who will survive? Because forgiveness is with you. For your name’s sake I have waited for you, O Lord; my soul has waited for your word, my soul has hoped in the Lord. From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch, let Israel hope in the Lord. Because with the Lord there is mercy and with him abundant redemption; and he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

****

Psalm 130
A Song of Ascents

Lord, my heart has not been exalted, nor have my eyes become lofty, I have neither walked among great affairs, nor among marvels beyond me. If I had not been humble-minded, but exalted my soul, like a weaned child towards its mother, so you will requite my soul. Let Israel hope in the Lord, from now and for ever.

****

Psalm 131
A Song of Ascents

Lord remember David and all his meekness, how he swore to the Lord, made a vow to the God of Jacob, ‘I shall not enter the shelter of my house, climb into my bed, I shall not give sleep to my eyes, slumber to my eyelids and rest to my temples, until I find a place for the Lord, a shelter for the God of Jacob’. See, we heard of it in Ephrata, we found it in the woodland fields. We shall enter his tabernacles, we shall worship at the place where his feet have stood. Arise, Lord, into your rest, you and the ark of your sanctification. Your priests will clothe themselves with justice, and your holy ones will rejoice. For David, your servant’s sake, do not turn away the face of your Christ. The Lord has sworn truth to David, and he will not annul it, ‘From the fruit of your womb I shall place on your throne. If your sons keep my covenant and these testimonies of mine which I shall teach them, their sons too will sit on your throne for ever. For the Lord has elected Sion, has chosen her as a dwelling for himself. ‘This is my resting-place for age on age. Here I shall dwell, for I have chosen her. Her door I shall bless abundantly, her poor I shall satisfy with bread. Her priests I shall clothe with salvation, and her holy ones will rejoice with great joy. There I shall make the horn of David flourish. I have prepared a lamp for my Christ. I shall clothe his enemies in shame, my sanctification will flower upon him’.

****

Psalm 132
A Song of Ascents

See how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together; like sweet ointment on the head, which runs down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, which runs down to the hem of his garment; like the dew from Hermon, which runs down upon the mountains of Sion; for there the Lord has commanded the blessing: life for ever more.

****

Psalm 133
A Song of Ascents

Come, now bless the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. Lift up your hands by night to the Holy Place, and bless the Lord. The Lord bless you from Sion, he who made heaven and earth.

Lord, I have cried **in Tone 1.**

Psalm 140

\[**A**\] Lord, I have cried to you, hear me; hear me, O Lord. Lord, I have cried to you, hear me. Give heed to the voice of my supplication when I cry to you. Hear me, O Lord.

\[

**B**\] Let my prayer be directed like incense before you: the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice. Hear me, O Lord.

\[

**A**\] Set a guard, O Lord, on my mouth: and a strong door about my lips.

\[

**B**\] Do not incline my heart to evil words: to make excuses for my sins.

\[

**A**\] With those who work iniquity: let me not unite with their elect.

\[

**B**\] The just will chastise me with mercy and reprove me: but let not the oil of sinners anoint my head.

\[

**A**\] For yet my prayer shall be in their pleasures: their judges have been swallowed up near the rock.

\[

**B**\] They will hear my words for they are sweet: as a clod of earth is crushed upon the ground their bones have been scattered at the mouth of Hell.

\[

**A**\] For my eyes look to you, O Lord, my Lord: I have hoped in you, do not take away my soul.

\[

**B**\] Keep me from the snare that they have hidden for me: and from the traps of evil-doers.

\[

**A**\] The sinners will fall into their own net: I am alone until I pass by. ****

Psalm 141

\[**B**\] With my voice I cried to the Lord: with my voice I entreated the Lord.

\[

**A**\] I will pour out my entreaty before him: and tell him all my trouble.

\[

**B**\] When my spirit was faint: you knew my path.

\[

**A**\] In the way where I walked: they had hidden a snare for me.

\[

**B**\] I looked to my right hand and saw: but there was none who knew me.

\[

**A**\] Escape is gone from me: and there is none who seeks for my soul.

\[

**B**\] I cried to you, Lord, I said, ‘You are my hope: my portion in the land of the living.’

\[

**A**\] Give heed to my supplication: for I am brought very low.

\[

**B**\] Deliver me from those who persecute me: for they are too strong for me. ****

10.

Bring my soul out of prison: that I may confess your name. ****

Tone 1.

A harlot knowing you, the Son of the Virgin, to be God, imploring you with weeping, for she had done things worthy of tears, said, ‘Loose my debt, as I unloose my hair; love one who loves, though justly hated, and along with tax-collectors I shall proclaim you, O Benefactor, who love humankind’.

****

9.

The just will await me: until you reward me.

The harlot mixed the sweet myrrh of great price with tears, poured it over your immaculate feet and kissed them. Her you justified at once, but grant us pardon, who suffered for us and save us.

****

Psalm 129
8.

Out of the depths I have cried to you, O Lord: Lord hear my voice.

When the sinful woman offered myrrh, then the disciple made an agreement with the lawless. The one rejoiced as she emptied out something of great price, while the other hurried to sell the One beyond price. She acknowledged the Master; he was parted from the Master. She was set free while Judas became the slave of the foe. Dreadful is sloth! Great is repentance! Grant it to me, Saviour, who suffered for us, and save us.

****

7.

O let your ears be attentive: to the voice of my supplication.

O the wretchedness of Judas! He watched the harlot kissing your feet and began plotting with guile the kiss of betrayal. She untied her locks and he was being bound by rage, bringing foul-smelling wickedness instead of myrrh; for envy does not know how to prefer its advantage. O the wretchedness of Judas! From it, O God, deliver our souls.

****

6.

If you, Lord, should mark iniquities: Lord, who will stand? But there is forgiveness with you. ****

Tone 2.

The sinful woman ran for the myrrh, to buy myrrh of great price, to anoint with myrrh the Benefactor, and to the myrrh-seller she cried, ‘Give me the myrrh, that I may anoint the One who has wiped away all my sins’.

****

5.

For your name’s sake I have waited for you, O Lord: my soul has waited on your word: my soul has hoped in the Lord. ****

Tone 6. Rejected.

The woman drowned by sin found you, the harbour of salvation, and emptying out myrrh with tears, she cried out to you, ‘See, the one who has authority to pardon sins. See, the One who waits for the repentance of the sinful. But, Master, save me from the tempest of my sin through your great mercy’.

****

Tone 5.

4.

From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch: let Israel hope in the Lord.

Today Christ comes to the house of the Pharisee and a sinful woman draws near and flings herself at his feet, crying, ‘See one who has been drowned by sin, without hope because of her deeds, yet not rejected with loathing from your goodness, and give me, Lord, forgiveness of my evil deeds and save me’.

****

3.

For with the Lord there is mercy, and with him plentiful redemption: and he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

The harlot spread out her hair for you, the Master; Judas spread out his hands to the lawless: she to receive forgiveness, he to receive silver. And so we cry to you, sold and who set us free, ‘Lord, glory to you!’

****

2.

Praise the Lord, all you nations: praise him all you peoples.

A woman foul-smelling and defiled drew near, pouring tears upon your feet, O Saviour, and proclaiming your passion. ‘How can I gaze upon you, Master? For you have come yourself to save a harlot. You roused Lazarus from the tomb after four days, raise me who am dead from the deep. Accept me in my misery, Lord, and save me’.

****

1.

For his mercy has been mighty towards us: and the truth of the Lord endures to the ages. ****

By Monk John. Same Tone. Model melody.

Rejected because of her life, well-known because of her ways, she approached you carrying sweet myrrh and crying, ‘You, who were born of a Virgin, do not cast me out, who am a harlot. Joy of the Angels, do not despise my tears; but, Lord, as I repent, accept me, whom you did not thrust from you when I sinned, through your great mercy’.

Glory. Both now.

**Tone 8.
By the Nun Kassiani.**

Lord, the woman who had fallen into many sins, perceiving your divinity, took up the role of myrrh-bearer, and with lamentation brings sweet myrrh to you before your burial. ‘Alas!’, she says, ‘for night is for me a frenzy of lust, a dark and moonless love of sin. Accept the fountains of my tears, you who from the clouds draw out the water of the sea; bow yourself down to the groanings of my heart, you who bowed the heavens by your ineffable self-emptying. I shall kiss your immaculate feet, and wipe them again with the locks of my hair, those feet whose sound Eve heard at dusk in Paradise, and hid herself in fear. Who can search out the multitude of my sins and the depths of your judgements, my Saviour, saviour of souls? Do not despise me, your servant, for you have mercy without measure’

**2:11-22***\]*

It came to pass in that length of days, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his people, the children of Israel, and saw their forced labour. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his kinsfolk. He looked this way and that, and seeing no one he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. When he went out the next day, he saw two Hebrews fighting; and he said to the one who was in the wrong, ‘Why do you strike your fellow Hebrew?’ He answered, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’ Then Moses was afraid and thought, ‘Surely the thing is known.’ When Pharao heard of it, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharao. He settled in the land of Madiam. On entering the land of Madiam he sat down by a well. The priest of Madiam had seven daughters, who shepherded the flocks of the father Jethro. They came to draw water, and filled the troughs to water their father Jethro’s flock. But some shepherds came and drove them away. Moses got up and came to their defence and watered their flock. When they returned to their father Jethro, he said, ‘How is it that you have come back so soon today?’ They said, ‘An Egyptian helped us against the shepherds; he even drew water for us and watered the flock.’ He said to his daughters, ‘Where is he? Why did you leave the man? Invite him to eat bread.’ Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Sephora in marriage. She conceived and bore a son, and Moses named him Gershom; for he said, ‘I have been an alien residing in a foreign land.’ She conceived again and gave birth to a second son, and he called his name Eliezer, saying, ‘For the God of my father is my helper, and has delivered me from the hand of Pharao’.

**2:1-10**\]

One day the angels of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the devil also came among them to present himself before the Lord. The Lord said to the devil, ‘Where have you come from?’ The devil answered the Lord, ‘From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down through the whole of it.’ The Lord said to the devil, ‘Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth, an innocent, true, blameless man who fears God and turns away from every evil deed. He still persists in innocence, although you incited me to destroy his property for no reason.’ Then the devil answered the Lord, ‘Skin for skin! All that people have they will give to save their lives. But stretch out your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will bless you to your face.’ The Lord said to the devil, ‘Very well, I hand him over to you; only spare his life.’ So the devil went out from the presence of the Lord, and inflicted loathsome sores on Job from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. Job took a potsherd with which to scrape away the discharge, and sat on the dung heap outside the city. And after a long time had passed his wife said to him, ‘How long will you persist, saying, ‘See, I am waiting yet a little while, expecting the hope of my salvation’? For see, your memorial has been abolished from the earth: the sons and daughters, pangs and labours of my womb, which I bore in vain with sorrows; while you sit among the corruption of worms, spending the night under the open sky, and I am a wanderer and a servant, going round from place to place and from house to house, waiting for the sun to set, that I may rest from the sorrows and pains which now beset me. But speak a word against the Lord, and die’. But he looked at her and said, ‘Why have you spoken thus, like one of the foolish women? If we have accepted good at the hand of God, shall we not accept bad?’ In all this Job did not sin with his lips before God.

\[

**26:6-16**\]

When Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, a woman approached him with an alabaster jar of very precious ointment and she poured it on his head as he sat at table. When his disciples saw they were indignant and said, ‘Why this waste? For this ointment could have been sold for a great deal and given to the poor.’ But Jesus, knowing, said to them, ‘Why are you making trouble for the woman? She has performed a good deed for me. For you always have the poor with you; you do not always have me. By pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it for my burial. Amen I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told also in memory of her.’ Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, ‘What are willing to give me if I betray him to you?’ They settled with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from then on he was looking for an opportunity to betray him.

Master, holy and supremely good, we implore you by your rich mercy to be merciful to us sinners and to make us worth of the reception of your only-begotten Son and our God, the King of glory. For see, his most pure Body and life-giving Blood, entering at this present hour, are about to be placed on this mystical table, invisibly escorted by a multitude of the heavenly army. Grant us to communion of them without condemnation, so that, the eye of our mind being illumined through them, we may become children of light and of the day.

To you, O Lord. ****

Priest:

God of ineffable and unseen mysteries, with whom are the hidden treasures of wisdom and knowledge, who have revealed the service of this liturgy to us and through your great love for mankind placed us sinners to offer you gifts and sacrifices for our own sins and for those committed in ignorance by the people; do you yourself, invisible King, who do great and unfathomable things, things glorious and marvellous, which are without number, look upon us your unworthy servants, who stand at this your holy altar, as at your cherubic throne, on which, through these dread things here set forth, rests your only-begotten Son and our God. And , having freed us and your faithful people from all uncleanness, make holy the souls and bodies of us all with holiness that cannot be taken away, so that, partaking with a pure conscience, face unashamed and enlightened heart of these divine Holy Things and being given life by them, we may be united to your Christ himself, our true God, who said, ‘One who eats my flesh and rinks my blood abides in me and I in them’. So that, with your Word, Lord, abiding and dwelling in us, we may become temples of your all-holy and venerable Spirit, redeemed from every wile of the devil brought about by deed or word or in thought. And may we obtain the good things promised us with all your saints who have been well-pleasing to you from every age.

****

Then, as the Priest distributes the Antidoron,

Psalm 33

I will bless the Lord at all times, his praise shall always be in my mouth. In the Lord my soul will be praised; let the meek hear it and rejoice. Magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. I sought the Lord and he heard me, and he delivered me from all my afflictions. Draw near to him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him from all his afflictions. The angel of the Lord will encamp round those who fear him, and deliver them. Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed the man who hopes in him! Fear the Lord, all you his saints, for there is not want for those who fear him. The rich became have become poor and gone hungry, but those who seek the Lord will not be deprived of any good. Come, my children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Who is there who wants life, who loves to see good days? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking guile. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are on the just, and his ears towards their supplication. The Lord sets his face against those who do evil, to destroy their memory from the earth. The just cried and the Lord heard them, and delivered them from all their afflictions. The Lord is close to those who are broken-hearted, and he will save the humble in spirit. The afflictions of the just are many, but the Lord will deliver them from them all. The Lord guards all their bones; not one of them will be broken. The death of sinners is evil. Those who hate the just will go astray. The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants, and none who hope in him will go astray.

\[

**Psalm 144
**I will exalt you, my God, my King; and I will bless your name for ever and to age on age. Every day I will bless you; and praise your name for ever and to age on age. The Lord is great and highly to be praised; and there is no limit to his greatness. Generation after generation will praise your works; and will declare your power. They will tell of the majesty of the glory of your holiness; and will recount your wonders. They will speak of the power of your dread deeds; and will recount your greatness. They will proclaim the memory of the multitude of your goodness; and rejoice in your justice. The Lord is compassionate and merciful; long-suffering and full of mercy. The Lord is good to all; and his acts of compassion are for all his works. May all your works confess you, Lord; and all your holy ones bless you. They will speak of the glory of your kingdom; and tell of your power. To make known your power and of the glory the majesty of your kingdom to the children of mankind. Your kingdom is a kingdom for all the ages, and your dominion for every generation. The Lord is faithful in all his words, and holy in all his works. The Lord supports all who are falling, and sets upright all who are broken down. The eyes of all hope in you, and you give them their food in due season. You open your hand, and fill every living thing with your good pleasure. The Lord is just in all his ways, and holy in all his works. The Lord is close to those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. He will do the will of those who fear him, and hear their supplication and save them. The Lord guards all who love him, and all sinners he will destroy. My mouth will tell the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and to age on age.\] ****

Priest:

The blessing of the Lord be upon you, by his grace and love for mankind, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. ****

Reader:

Amen. ****

Priest:

Glory to you, Christ God, our hope, glory to you. ****

Reader:

Glory. Both now. Lord, have mercy (**x3**). Holy Master, give the blessing. ****

And the Dismissal.

Priest:

May he who comes to his voluntary passion, Christ our true God, through the prayers of his all-pure and holy Mother, by the power of the precious and life-giving Cross, through the protection of the honoured, Bodiless Powers of heaven, through the intercessions of the honoured, glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist, John, of the holy, glorious and all-praised Apostles, of the holy, glorious and triumphant Martyrs, of our venerable and God-bearing Fathers and Mothers who have shone forth in the ascetic life, of our Father among the Saints Gregory Dialogist, Pope of Rome, of the holy and righteous forebears of God, Joachim and Anna, \[of Saint **N**. (**to whom the Church is dedicated**), of Saint **N**., whose memory we keep today,\] and of all the Saints, have mercy on us and save us, for he is good and loves mankind.

Through the prayers of our holy fathers, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, have mercy on us.

****

People:

Amen. ****

At the Thanksgiving after Holy Communion we say the Apolytikion and Kontakion of St Gregory Dialogist, Pope of Rome.

Tone 3.

Enriched with a watchful mouth, you were revealed as noble herdsman of the divine word, Hierarch Gregory; for you became one who manifested the virtues, showing forth the radiance of justice. Venerable Father, implore Christ God to grant us his great mercy.

Glory.

**Tone 8. To you my Champion.**

Let us fittingly sing the praise of the Dialogist, harp of the Church inspired by God and tongue truly possessed by divine wisdom, for imitating the zeal of the Apostles he followed clearly in their footsteps, as we say to him, Hail, Father Gregory!

Both now.

**Theotokion.**

At the prayers of all your Saints and of the Mother of God, grant us your peace, Lord, and have mercy on us, for you alone love humankind.
