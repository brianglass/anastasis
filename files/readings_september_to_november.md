He has sent me to preach good tidings to the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, to proclaim forgiveness to prisoners and sight to the blind; to declare an acceptable year of the Lord, and a day of recompense for our God; to comfort all who mourn, that there be given to those who mourn Sion, glory instead of ashes, an anointing of joy for those who mourn, clothing of glory instead of a spirit of listlessness; and they shall be called a generation of righteousness, a plant of the Lord for glory. And they will rebuild everlasting<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>deserts, those formerly quite deserted; they will raise up and renew deserted cities, deserted from generation to generation. And strangers will come shepherding your flocks, and foreigners shall be your ploughmen and vinedressers. But you will be called Priests of the Lord, ministers of our God. You will be told, Â‘Eat the strength of nationsÂ’, and in their wealth you will be marvelled at; instead of your double shame and instead of humiliation their portion will rejoice. Therefore they will inherit their land a second time, and everlasting joy shall be upon their head. For I am the Lord, who loves righteousness and hates robberies from injustice; and I shall give their calf to the righteous, and I shall make an everlasting testament with them. And their seed will be known among the nations, and their offspring in the midst of the peoples, because they are a seed blessed for ever by God, and with joy they will rejoice in the Lord.</span>

The Lord spoke to the children of Israel saying, Â‘If you walk in my ordinances and keep my commandments and do them, I will give you rain in its season and the earth will give its produce and the trees of the plains their fruit. Your threshing time will overtake the vintage, and the vintage will overtake the sowing. You will eat your bread to the full and dwell in safety on your land; and no one shall make you afraid. And I will destroy the evil wild beasts from your lands, and war shall not pass through your land, and enemies will fall before you. Five of you will pursue a hundred and a hundred of you will pursue tens of thousands. And I will look upon you and bless you and make you increase and multiply and I will establish my covenant with you. And you will eat what is old and very old, and bring out the old to make way for the new. And my soul will not abhor you, and I will walk among you, and I will be your God and you shall be my people. But if you will not listen to me, nor observe these ordinances of mine, but disobey them, and if your soul loathes my judgements, so that you do not keep all my commandments, I in turn will treat you like this: I will bring distress upon you, and you will sow your seed in vain and your enemies will devour your labours. And I will set my face against you and you will fall before your foes and they will pursue you and you will flee though no one pursues you; and I will smash the arrogance of your pride. And I will make the heaven like iron for you and your earth like solid bronze. And your strength will be in vain and your land will not give its fruit, and the trees of the field will not give their fruit. And I will send the wild beasts of the earth against you, and they will consume your cattle, and the sword will come against you and make you few in number. And your land will be desert and your farms will be desert; because you have walked against me crookÂ­edly, and I will walk against you with crooked rage, says the Lord God, the Holy One of IsraelÂ’.

When you do glorious deeds, trembling from you will seize the mountains. From eternity we have not heard, nor have our eyes seen any God but you. And your works are true, and you will perform mercy for those who wait for you. For mercy will meet with those who do right and remember your ways. And now, Lord, you are our Father, while we are clay and you are our Fashioner. We are all the work of your hands. Do not be exceedingly angry with us, Lord, and do not remember our sins for ever.

Hear the word of the Lord, house of Jacob, and every family of the house of Israel. Thus says the Lord, Â‘What offence did your fathers find in me, that they revolted far from me and went after vanities and became vain? And they did not say, Â“Where is the Lord who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who guided us in the wilderness, in a boundless and trackless land, in a land without water or fruit, and in the shadow of death, in a land through which no man had passed, nor had any son of man dwelt there?Â” And I led you to Carmel to eat its fruits and its good things; and you went in and you defiled my land and made my inheritance an abomination. The priests did not say Â“Where is the Lord?Â” And those who cling to the law did not know me, and the shepherds acted impiously towards me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal and went after that which does not profit. Therefore I will be brought to trial before you again, says the Lord, and I will be brought to trial before your childrenÂ’s children. Cross to the islands of the Kittim and look, and to Kedar and send and observe carefully; and see if such things have been done; if the nations will change their gods, though they are no gods. But my people have changed their glory for something from which they will gain nothing. Heaven was amazed at this and trembled exceedinglyÂ’, says the Lord.</span>

With wisdom God founded the earth. He prepared the heavens with understanding. With his knowledge the deeps were broken open and the clouds poured down dew. My son, keep my counsel and my thought, do not pour them away, that your soul may live and grace be around your neck; and there shall be health for your flesh and safety for your bones; that with confidence you may walk all your ways in peace, and your foot may not stumble. For if you sit down, you shall be unafraid; if you slumber, you shall have sweet sleep; you shall not fear alarm coming upon you, nor the assaults of the impious; for the Lord shall be over all your ways and shall support your feet, so that you are not snared. Do not hold back from doing good to the needy, whenever your hand is able to help. Do not say, Â‘Come back again sometimeÂ’, and Â‘Tomorrow I shall giveÂ’: when you are able, do good, for you do not know what the coming day will bring forth. Do not devise evils for your friend who lives near you and trusts you. Do not quarrel with someone needlessly, lest they devise some evil against you. Do not gain the reproaches of wicked men, nor covet their ways; for every transgressor is unclean before the Lord, he does not take his seat among the just. The LordÂ’s curse is on the houses of the ungodly, but the dwellings of the just are blessed. The Lord opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.

Wisdom has built herself a house and set up seven pillars. She has slaughtered her beasts, mixed the wine in her mixing bowl and prepared her table. She has sent out her servants, inviting with a loud proclamation to her banquet saying, Â‘Whoever is foolish, let him turn in here to me,Â’ and to those lacking understanding she said, Â‘Come, eat my bread, drink the wine I have mixed for you. Abandon folly and you will live; seek sagacity that you may have life, and correct understanding with knowledge. He who reproves wicked men will receives from them dishonour; he who rebukes the impious will shame himself. For to the impious rebukes are bruises. Do not rebuke the wicked, lest they hate you: rebuke a wise man and he will love you. Give a wise man an opportunity, and he will become wiser; instruct a just man and he will continue to receive. The beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord; and the counsel of saints, understanding; knowing the law is the mark of a right mind. For by this means you will live a long time, and years will be added to your life.Â’

For it is better to trade for her than for treasures of gold and silver. She is more precious than valuable stones; nothing evil will withstand her; she is well known to all who draw near her, nothing precious is worthy of her, for length of life and years of life are in her right hand, while in her left are wealth and glory.

And whenever the cloud went up from the tent, after that the people of Israel set out. And in the place where the cloud stopped, there the people of Israel encamped. At the command of the Lord the people of Israel encamped, and at the command of the Lord they set out. Â‘For as many days as the cloud overshadows the tabernacle, the children of Israel will remain in camp. Even when the cloud has continued over the tabernacle many days, the children of Israel will keep the charge of the Lord, and they are not to set out. And it shall that whenever the cloud covers the tabernacle for a number of days, in accordance with the word of the Lord they will remain in camp, and in accordance with the command of the Lord they will set out. And it shall be that whenever the cloud remains from evening until morning; and that the cloud goes up in the morning, they will set out by day or by night. When the cloud overshadows it for a month, or longer, the children of Israel shall remain in camp and not set out. Because they will set out at the command of the LordÂ’.

And it came to pass in the first month in the second year since the children of Israel had set out from Egypt, at the new moon the tabernacle was erected. And Moses erected the tabernacle; he laid its capitals, put in its bars, and raised up its pillars. And he spread the curtains over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tabernacle over it, as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he took the testimonies and put them into the ark, and put the poles under the ark, and put the covering of the veil on it and covered the ark of testimony, as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he put the table in the tabernacle of testimony, on the north side, outside the veil of the tabernacle. And he set the bread of the on it before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he put the lampstand in the tabernacle of testimony, on the south side of the tabernacle, and set up its lamps before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he put the golden altar in the tabernacle of testimony before the veil, and on it he burnt incense that had been compounded; as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tabernacle. And he set the court round the tabernacle of testimony. So Moses finished the whole work. Then the cloud covered the tabernacle of testimony, and the tabernacle was filled with the glory of the Lord. And Moses was not able to enter the tabernacle of testimony because the cloud overshadowed it, and the tabernacle was filled with the glory of the Lord. Whenever the cloud went up from the tabernacle, the children of Israel would move off with their baggage. but if the cloud did not go up, then they did not move off until the day that the cloud did go up. For the cloud was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all Israel at every stage of their journey.

Who knows whether he will not return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, a sacrifice and a libation for the Lord, your God? Sound the trumpet in Sion; sanctify a fast; proclaim healing, assemble the people; sanctify the congregation; choose elders; assemble the infants that suck at the breast. Let the bridegroom leave his room, and the bride her chamber. Between the porch and the altar the priests, the ministers of the Lord, shall weep and say, Â‘Spare your people, Lord, and do not make your heritage a reproach, for the nations to rule over them, lest they say among the nations, Â“Where is their God?Â”Â’ Then the Lord became jealous for his land, and spared his people. The Lord answered and said to his people, Â‘See, I am sending to you wheat, wine, and oil, and you will be filled; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations. I will drive the Northerner away from you, and banish him into a waterless land. I will make his face disappear his into the first sea, and his back into the final sea; and his rottenness will rise and his foul smell will rise, for he has done great things. Take courage, O land; rejoice and be glad, for the Lord has done great things! Take courage, you beasts of the field, for the plains of the wilderness have sprouted; the tree has borne its fruit, fig tree and vine have given their strength. Rejoice, children of Sion, and be glad in the Lord, your God; for he has given you food for justice, he will poured down the early and the latter rain as before. The threshing floors shall be full of grain, the vats shall overflow with wine and oil. I will restore to you the years which the locust has eaten, the caterpillar, the worm, and the canker, my great power, which I sent against you. You shall eat in plenty and be filled, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never again be put to shame. You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I, the Lord, am your God and there is none but me. And my people shall never again be put to shame.</span>

And upon my servants and my maid servants I shall pour out of my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy; and I shall show wonders in the heaven above and signs in the earth beneath, blood and fire and the vapour of smoke; the sun will be transformed to darkness and the moon to blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord comes; and it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.</span>

And behold, the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the oak of Joas in Ephrata, and Gedeon his son was threshing wheat in the wine-press, and hastening to escape from the presence of Madiam. And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, Â‘The Lord is with you, powerful in strength.Â’ And Gedeon said to him, Â‘In me, my Lord; and if the Lord is with us, why have all these evils come upon us? And where are all his wonders, of which our fathers told us, saying, Â“Did not the Lord lead us up out of Egypt?Â” And now He has abandoned us, and handed us over to the hand of Madiam.Â’ And the Angel of the Lord looked on him and said to him, Â‘Go in this strength of yours and you will save Israel from the hand of Madiam. See, I have sent you.Â’ And Gedeon said to him, Â‘In me, Lord. How shall I save Israel? See, my thousand is the humblest in Manasse, and I am the smallest in my fatherÂ’s house.Â’ And the Angel of the Lord said to him, Â‘The Lord will be with you, and you will smite Madiam as one man.Â’ And Gedeon said to him, Â‘If I have found grace in your eyes, and you do for me to-day everything about which you have spoken with me, do not, pray, leave here until I come to you, and I shall bring my sacrifice and sacrifice before you.Â’ And he said, Â‘I am, I shall sit here until you return.Â’ And Gedeon went and prepared a goat kid and an iphi of unleavened flour, and he put the meat in a basket and the broth he put in a pot and brought them to him under the oak, and approached. And the Angel of the Lord said to him, Â‘Take the meat and the unleavened loaves and put them on that rock and pour out the broth next it.Â’ And he did so. And the Angel of the Lord stretched out the tip of the rod in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened loaves; and fire was kindled from the rock and it devoured the meat and the unleavened loaves; and the Angel of the Lord disappeared from his sight. And Gedeon saw that it was the Angel of the Lord, and Gedeon said, Â‘Alas Lord, Lord! Because I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face. And the Lord said to him: Â‘Peace to you, do not be afraid, you shall not die.Â’ And Gedeon built there an altar to the Lord, and called it <span style="text-transform:

\[<span style="color:red;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">10, 1-21</span>\]</span>

In the third year of Cyrus, king of the Persians, a word was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Baltasar; and the word was true and a mighty power, and understanding was given him in a vision. In those days, I Daniel had been mourning for three weeks of days. And desiring bread, I did not eat, and meat and wine did not enter my mouth, I did not anoint myself with oil until the completion of the three weeks of days. And on the twenty fourth of the first month in the third year, I was near the great river, that is the Tigris. And I raised my eyes and looked, and behold a man, clothed in linen, his loins girt with gold of Ophaz; and his body was as Tharsis, and his face like the sight of lightning, and his eyes like lamps of fire, and his arms and legs like the sight of gleaming bronze, and the sound of his words was as the sound of a crowd. And I Daniel alone saw the vision, and the men who were with me saw nothing; but great amazement fell on them and they fled in fear. And I was left alone, and I saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me, and my glory was turned to corruption, and I retained no strength. And I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of his words I was stunned with my face to the ground. And behold a hand was touching me and raised me to my knees and the knuckles of my hands. And he said to me, Â‘Daniel, man of desires, understand by the words which I speak to you, and stand upright, because I have been sent to youÂ’; and when he had spoken this word to me I arose trembling. And he said to me, Â‘Daniel, do not be afraid, because from the first day that you gave your heart to understand and to be afflicted before the Lord your God, your words were heard, and I have come through your words. And the Ruler of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me for twenty one days; and behold Michael one of the chief Rulers came to help me, and I left him there with the Ruler of the kingdom of the Persians. And I have come to make you understand all that will happen to your people in the last days; because the vision is yet for days ahead.Â’ And when he spoke to me in these words, I put my face to the ground and was stunned. And behold as the likeness of a son of man touched my lips; and I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him who stood in front of me, Â‘Lord, at the sight of you, my inward parts were turned within me, and I had no strength. And how will your servant, Lord, be able to speak with this my Lord? And from now on strength will not remain in me, and breath has not been left in me.Â’ And once again there touched me as it were the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me and said to me, Â‘Do not be afraid, man of desires, peace be with you; be a man and be strong.Â’ And when he had spoken with me I grew strong and said: Â‘Let my Lord speak to me, for you have given me strength.Â’ And he said, Â‘Do you know why I have come to you? And now I shall return to make war on the Ruler of the Persians; and as I was going in the Ruler of the Greeks came. But I shall tell you what is ordained in the scripture of truth, and there is not one that upholds me against these, but Michael your Ruler.
