Go forth from Babylon, as you flee from the Chaldeans; declare this with a shout of joy, let this be heard; proclaim it to the end of the earth; say, ‘The Lord has delivered his servant Jacob!’ And if they thirst, he will bring them through the desert; he will bring water out of the rock for them; the rock will be split open and water will gush out, and my people will drink.

And he said to me, ‘You are my servant, Israel, and in you I will be glorified.’ But I said, ‘I have laboured in vain, I have given my strength for nothing and for futility; therefore my judgement is from the Lord, and my toil before my God.’ </span>

\[<span style="color:red">27,1–41</span>\] </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">It came to pass that when Isaac was old and his eyes had become dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, ‘My son’; and he answered, ‘Here I am.’ He said, ‘See, I have grown old and I do not know the day of my death. Now then, take your equipment, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me, and prepare for me savoury food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat; that my soul bless you before I die.’ But Rebecca heard Isaac speaking to his son Esau. Esau went to the field to hunt for game for his father. But Rebecca said to her son Jacob, the younger, ‘See, I heard your father speaking to your brother Esau, saying, “Bring me game, and prepare for me savoury food, that I may eat it, and bless you before the Lord before I die.” Now therefore, my son, hear me as I command you. Go to the flock, and from there fetch me two fine, tender kids, and I will make them into savoury food for your father, such as he loves; and you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that your father may bless you before he dies.’ But Jacob said to Rebecca his mother, ‘My brother Esau is a hairy man, while I am a smooth man. Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him, and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.’ His mother said to him, ‘Upon me be your curse, my child; only obey my word, and go, bring them to me.’ So he went and took them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared savoury food, such as his father loved. Then Rebecca took the best garments of Esau her elder son, the best ones which were by her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son; and the skins of the kids she put upon his arms and upon the exposed part of his neck; and she gave the savoury food and the loaves, which she had prepared, into the hands of her son Jacob. So he took them in to his father. And he said, ‘Father’; and he said, ‘Here I am; who are you, my child?’ Jacob said to his father, ‘I am Esau your first-born. I have done as you commanded me me; now arise, sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.’ But Isaac said to his son, ‘How is that you have found so quickly, my child?’ He answered, ‘What the Lord your God put before me.’ Then Isaac said to Jacob, ‘Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are my son Esau or not.’ So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, ‘The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.’ And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him, and said, ‘Are you my son Esau?’ He answered, ‘I am.’ Then he said, ‘Bring it to me, and I will eat of your game, my child,<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a> that my soul may bless you.’ So he brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank. Then his father Isaac said to him, ‘Come near and kiss me, my child.’ So he came near and kissed him; and he smelt the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, ‘See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a full field which the Lord has blessed! May God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine. Let nations serve you, and rulers bow down to you. Be lord over your brother, and your father’s sons will bow down to you. The one who curses you is cursed, and the one who blesses you is blessed.’ And it came to pass after Isaac had finished blessing Jacob his son, when Jacob had gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. He also prepared savoury food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, ‘Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s game, that your soul may bless me.’ His father Isaac said to him, ‘Who are you?’ He answered, ‘I am your son, your first-born, Esau.’ Then Isaac was greatly amazed, and said, ‘Who was it then that hunted game for me and brought it to me, and I ate of all of it before you came, and I have blessed him? And he shall be blessed.’ When Esau heard his father Isaac’s words, he cried out with an great and bitter cry, and said to his father, ‘Bless me also, father!’ But he said, ‘Your brother came with guile, and took your blessing.’ Esau said, ‘Rightly he was named Jacob? For see he has supplanted me this second time. He took my birthright; and now he has taken my blessing.’ Then Esau said to his father, ‘Have you not a blessing left for me, father?’ Isaac answered Esau, ‘If I have made him your lord, and all his brothers his servants, and with corn and wine I have sustained him, what then can I do for you, my son?’ Esau said to his father, ‘Have you only one blessing, father? Bless me also, father.’ But Isaac was stunned<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> and Esau lifted up his voice and wept. Then Isaac his father answered him and said, ‘See, away from<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, and away from the dew of heaven from on high. And you shall live by your sword, and you shall serve your brother; but the time will come when you will destroy and loose his yoke from your neck.’ And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him.’ </span>

\[<span style="color:red">19,16–25</span>\] </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">One who keeps a commandment guards their own life; but one who despises their own ways will perish. One who is merciful to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him in accordance with his gift. Discipline your son for thus there will be good hope; do not be exalted in your soul to arrogance. A man who thinks evil will pay a great penalty; and if he commits injury he will lose his life. Listen, my son, to the instruction of your father, that you may become wise at your last days. Many are the thoughts in the heart of a man, but the purpose of the Lord endures for ever. Acts of mercy are fruit for a man, while a just beggar is better than a rich liar. The fear of the Lord leads to life for a man; but one without fear will encamp in places which knowledge does not visit. One who hides his hands in his bosom unjustly, will not even bring them to his mouth. When the pestilent is scourged, a fool becomes more astute. But if your chastise a prudent man, he will understand knowledge. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The Lord said to Jacob, ‘Return to the land of your father and to your kindred, and I will be with you.’ So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leia into the field where his flocks were, and said to them, ‘I see that your father’s face, it is not as it was towards me yesterday and the day before. But the God of my father has been with me. You know that I have served your father with all my strength; yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages of ten lambs, but God did not permit him to harm me. If he said, “The spotted shall be your wages,” then all the sheep bore spotted; and if he said, “The white shall be your wages,” then all the sheep bore white. Thus God has taken away the your father’s animals, and given them to me. And it came to pass, when the sheep had </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-language:HE">conceived and were with young,</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, ’Jacob, Jacob’, and I said, ’Here I am! What is it?’ And he said, ’With your eyes look up and see, the he-goats and rams that mount ewes and she-goats are striped, spotted, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you. I am the God who appeared to you in God’s place, where you anointed a pillar to me and made a vow to me. Now therefore arise, go forth from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’’’ Then Rachel and Leia answered and said to him, ‘Is there any part or inheritance left to us in our father’s house? Are we not reckoned by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has been devoured the money given for us. All the wealth and glory which God has taken away from our father shall be for us and our children. Now therefore, do whatever God has told you.’ </span>

One that gathers treasures with a lying tongue pursues futility <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">and goes</span> towards the snare of death.

Better to dwell in a corner under the sky, than in stuccoed  <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

When a dissolute person is punished the guileless becomes cleverer: while a wise one who understands will receive knowledge. A just person understands the hearts of the ungodly: and despises the ungodly in their wicked deeds. One that stops his ears from hearing the weak, will cry out himself, and there shall be no one to listen. A secret gift turns away anger: but one who refrains from giving rouses strong wrath. The joy of the just to do judgement: but a holy <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">person</span> is unclean to evil-doers. A man who strays from the way of justice, will rest in the congregation of giants.<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> A poor man loves joy, making friends of wine and oil in abundance; while a transgressor is an off-scouring of a just one. It is  better to dwell in a desert land than with a quarrelsome, talkative and quick-tempered woman. A desirable treasure will rest on the mouth of the wise; but foolish men will swallow it up. The way of justice and mercy will find life and glory. </span>

Break your bread for the hungry, and lead the poor who have no shelter into your house: if you see someone naked, clothe <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">them</span>, and you are not to disregard the relations of your own seed.

And there went up with him also chariots and horsemen; and it was a very great company. And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan; and they lamented him with great and intense lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father for seven days. And the inhabitants of the land of Chanaan saw the mourning at the floor of Atad, and said, </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

\[<span style="color:red">31:8-31</span>\] </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-language:HE">Open your mouth with the word of God, and judge all things fairly</span><a href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21">[21]</a><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-language:HE">. Open your mouth and judge justly, and defend the poor and weak. Who can find a dynamic wife? Such a wife is more valuable than precious stones. The heart of her husband has confidence in her: such a wife will not be in need of fine spoils. For she achieves good for her husband all her life long. Winding off wool and flax, she makes</span><a href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22">[22]</a><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-language:HE"> it serviceable with her hands. She is like a ship trading from a afar: and she gathers her wealth. And she rises by night, and gives food to her household, and tasks to her maidservants. She views a farm, and buys it: and with the fruit of her hands she plants a plot of land. She strongly girds her loins, and sets her arms to work. She knows by experience that working is good; and her lamp is not extinguished all night. She reaches out her arms to what is needful, and applies her hands to the spindle. She opens her hands to the poor, and hands out fruit to the needy. Her husband is not anxious about those at home when he delays somewhere: for all those round her are clothed. She makes outer garments of double thickness for her husband, and garments of fine linen and scarlet for herself. Her husband becomes a an object of admiration in the gates, when he sits in council with the senior inhabitants of the land. She makes fine linens and sells them to the Phoenicians, and girdles to the Canaanites. She puts on strength and glory; and rejoices in the last days. She opens her mouth with care and with propriety, and keeps control over her tongue. The ways of her household are careful</span><a href="#_ftn23" id="_ftnref23">[23]</a><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-language:HE">, and she does not eat the bread of idleness. </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
mso-bidi-language:HE">She opens her mouth wisely, and in accordance with law. </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-language:HE">And <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">her</span> generosity establishes her children, and they grow rich, and her husband praises her. Many daughters have obtained power, many have gained wealth; but you have exceeded, and surpassed them all. Charms are false, and a woman’s beauty is worthless: for it is a woman of understanding that is blessed, and let her praise the fear the Lord. Give her of the fruit of her lips; and let her husband be praised in the gates. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">[1]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The Hebrew has the more subtle, ’of my son’s game’. Some modern English versions, such as NAB and NIV, have adopted the<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"> lxx </span>version. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref2" id="_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> This clause is not in the Hebrew and its meaning is not clear. The verb is very rare in classical Greek and means ’to pierce, stab or gouge’. But is more frequent in the passive and used metaphorically, ’to be stunned, bewildered’, and even ’to be silenced’. In patristic Greek, of course, it takes on the meaning ’to be moved to repentance’; and the cognate noun, *katanyxis*, means ’compunction ’.  The meaning here, then, could be either ’stunned ’, or ’deeply moved’, or ’reduced to silence’. The NAB and the *Jerusalem Bible*, in both French and English, follow the Septuagint and give the verb the latter meaning. The Vulgate, followed by the Douai version, has ’moved ’. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref3" id="_ftn3">[3]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The Greek preposition *apo* presents a problem, as does the Hebrew. It could mean either ’from, of ’, or ’away from, far from’. In the context the latter seems more likely and this is how most translators understand it. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref4" id="_ftn4">[4]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The Hebrew word here translated in Greek as *giants* is the same as that in Psalm 87, where the Greek, by a deliberate misreading of the Hebrew, has *doctors*. The reference is to the dead, the *shades*. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref5" id="_ftn5">[5]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> This sentence is not in the Hebrew. Another possible translation is *Blessed be that man by God.* </span>

<a href="#_ftnref6" id="_ftn6">[6]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The last clauses are not in the Hebrew. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref7" id="_ftn7">[7]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The Greek of this clause is not easy, and the translation given is only a suggestion. The Hebrew means something like, *the ungodly puts on a bold face*. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref8" id="_ftn8">[8]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The Greek word means both *is taught* and *is disciplined*. This is difficult to reproduce in English. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref9" id="_ftn9">[9]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Psalm 116 is omitted, presumably because it is only two verses long. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref10" id="_ftn10">[10]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> This is meaning of the Greek, which has misread the Hebrew, which means *abomination.* </span>

<a href="#_ftnref11" id="_ftn11">[11]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The Hebrew has ’Pharaoh’, not ’Joseph’. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref12" id="_ftn12">[12]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The Hebrew is quite different. The Greek translator appears to have underlined the financial aspect of the dangers of eating and drinking with others. Polonius would have agreed. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref13" id="_ftn13">[13]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> This verse, 23, is not in the original Septuagint, but it is found in the Triodion. The Greek is a possible translation of the Hebrew, but most versions translate the latter with something like: ’Buy</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:HE"> truth, and do not sell &lt;*it; buy*&gt; wisdom, instruction, and understanding</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">’</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:HE"> \[NRSV\]. The bracketed words in italics are not in the Hebrew, and the Greek is a literal version of the Hebrew. Some scholars consider the verse to be a secondary addition to the Hebrew.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref14" id="_ftn14">[14]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The Greek here is very odd. The Hebrew refers to the dangers of prostitutes for a young man. ’Foreignness’ is linked in the Old Testament to idolatry, which is often seen as adultery and ’foreign’ women as a danger since the time of Solomon. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref15" id="_ftn15">[15]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> This verse bears virtually no relation to the Hebrew, which continues the theme of the dangers of the prostitute. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref16" id="_ftn16">[16]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The Greek word *peripatos* means a place for walking, particularly a covered walk, but also a ’discussion’ such as one might take part while walking in such a place. It also refers to the well known school of philosophy. The Hebrew again is quite different. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref17" id="_ftn17">[17]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Strictly ’one who prepares for burial’ with the cognate verb ’to prepare for burial’. This is the earliest occurrence of these two words in Greek, and the only ones in the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lxx</span>. The common word for ’bury ’ is *thapto*, and so it seems probable that these unusual words are used here to mean ’embalm ’. The Hebrew speaks of ’doctors ’. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref18" id="_ftn18">[18]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The Hebrew has ’children’. Does the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lxx</span> mean to include the women in those left behind? </span>

<a href="#_ftnref19" id="_ftn19">[19]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The editions of the Triodion differ here between singular and plural, as do the manuscripts and ancient versions. Wevers and Rahlfs both print a singular, but the plural is more natural and it is the reading of the Triodion published by the *Apostoliki Diakonia*, which is generally more reliable than other Greek editions. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref20" id="_ftn20">[20]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> This is the reading of the Triodion and many manuscripts, though the critical editions of Wevers and Rahlfs favour the first person. The phrase is not found in the Hebrew. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref21" id="_ftn21">[21]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> In Hebrew this verse is very different and its second half contains a well known problem of translation. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref22" id="_ftn22">[22]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> The majority of verbs in what follows are aorist, but this is simply because the Hebrew employs the ’perfect’. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref23" id="_ftn23">[23]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Literally ’watertight’. </span>
