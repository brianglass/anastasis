[It came to pass that when Isaac was old and his eyes had become dim so
that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him,
Â‘My sonÂ’; and he answered, Â‘Here I am.Â’ He said, Â‘See, I have grown
old and I do not know the day of my death. Now then, take your
equipment, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt
game for me, and prepare for me savoury food, such as I love, and bring
it to me that I may eat; that my soul bless you before I die.Â’ But
Rebecca heard Isaac speaking to his son Esau. Esau went to the field to
hunt for game for his father. But Rebecca said to her son Jacob, the
younger, Â‘See, I heard your father speaking to your brother Esau,
saying, Â“Bring me game, and prepare for me savoury food, that I may eat
it, and bless you before the Lord before I die.Â” Now therefore, my son,
hear me as I command you. Go to the flock, and from there fetch me two
fine, tender kids, and I will make them into savoury food for your
father, such as he loves; and you shall bring it to your father to eat,
so that your father may bless you before he dies.Â’ But Jacob said to
Rebecca his mother, Â‘My brother Esau is a hairy man, while I am a
smooth man. Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be
mocking him, and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.Â’ His
mother said to him, Â‘Upon me be your curse, my child; only obey my
word, and go, bring them to me.Â’ So he went and took them and brought
them to his mother; and his mother prepared savoury food, such as his
father loved. Then Rebecca took the best garments of Esau her elder son,
the best ones which were by her in the house, and put them on Jacob her
younger son; and the skins of the kids she put upon his arms and upon
the exposed part of his neck; and she gave the savoury food and the
loaves, which she had prepared, into the hands of her son Jacob. So he
took them in to his father. And he said, Â‘FatherÂ’; and he said, Â‘Here
I am; who are you, my child?Â’ Jacob said to his father, Â‘I am Esau
your first-born. I have done as you commanded me me; now arise, sit up
and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.Â’ But Isaac said to his
son, Â‘How is that you have found so quickly, my child?Â’ He answered,
Â‘What the Lord your God put before me.Â’ Then Isaac said to Jacob,
Â‘Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are my son
Esau or not.Â’ So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and
said, Â‘The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of
Esau.Â’ And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like
his brother EsauÂ’s hands; so he blessed him, and said, Â‘Are you my son
Esau?Â’ He answered, Â‘I am.Â’ Then he said, Â‘Bring it to me, and I
will eat of your game, my child,[[\[1\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn1){#_ftnref1} that my soul
may bless you.Â’ So he brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him
wine, and he drank. Then his father Isaac said to him, Â‘Come near and
kiss me, my child.Â’ So he came near and kissed him; and he smelt the
smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, Â‘See, the smell of my
son is as the smell of a full field which the Lord has blessed! May God
give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and
plenty of corn and wine. Let nations serve you, and rulers bow down to
you. Be lord over your brother, and your fatherÂ’s sons will bow down to
you. The one who curses you is cursed, and the one who blesses you is
blessed.Â’ And it came to pass after Isaac had finished blessing Jacob
his son, when Jacob had gone out from the presence of Isaac his father,
that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. He also prepared savoury
food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, Â‘Let my
father arise, and eat of his sonÂ’s game, that your soul may bless me.Â’
His father Isaac said to him, Â‘Who are you?Â’ He answered, Â‘I am your
son, your first-born, Esau.Â’ Then Isaac was greatly amazed, and said,
Â‘Who was it then that hunted game for me and brought it to me, and I
ate of all of it before you came, and I have blessed him? And he shall
be blessed.Â’ When Esau heard his father IsaacÂ’s words, he cried out
with an great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Â‘Bless me also,
father!Â’ But he said, Â‘Your brother came with guile, and took your
blessing.Â’ Esau said, Â‘Rightly he was named Jacob? For see he has
supplanted me this second time. He took my birthright; and now he has
taken my blessing.Â’ Then Esau said to his father, Â‘Have you not a
blessing left for me, father?Â’ Isaac answered Esau, Â‘If I have made
him your lord, and all his brothers his servants, and with corn and wine
I have sustained him, what then can I do for you, my son?Â’ Esau said to
his father, Â‘Have you only one blessing, father? Bless me also,
father.Â’ But Isaac was stunned[[\[2\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn2){#_ftnref2} and Esau
lifted up his voice and wept. Then Isaac his father answered him and
said, Â‘See, away from[[\[3\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference
style="mso-special-character:footnote"}](#_ftn3){#_ftnref3} the fatness
of the earth shall your dwelling be, and away from the dew of heaven
from on high. And you shall live by your sword, and you shall serve your
brother; but the time will come when you will destroy and loose his yoke
from your neck.Â’ And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with
which his father had blessed
him.Â’]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"}

[One who keeps a commandment guards their own life; but one who despises
their own ways will perish. One who is merciful to the poor lends to the
Lord, and he will repay him in accordance with his gift. Discipline your
son for thus there will be good hope; do not be exalted in your soul to
arrogance. A man who thinks evil will pay a great penalty; and if he
commits injury he will lose his life. Listen, my son, to the instruction
of your father, that you may become wise at your last days. Many are the
thoughts in the heart of a man, but the purpose of the Lord endures for
ever. Acts of mercy are fruit for a man, while a just beggar is better
than a rich liar. The fear of the Lord leads to life for a man; but one
without fear will encamp in places which knowledge does not visit. One
who hides his hands in his bosom unjustly, will not even bring them to
his mouth. When the pestilent is scourged, a fool becomes more astute.
But if your chastise a prudent man, he will understand
knowledge.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"}

reliable than other Greek
