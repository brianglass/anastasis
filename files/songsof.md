**SONGS OF THE FATHERS**

**This page will contain translations of some of the hymns of our Orthodox tradition, hymns which are one of the principal sources of our theology.**

**Abbot Gregorios of Docheiariou on Mount Athos is fond of saying:**

If you want to learn Orthodox theology, you will find it in the [**Paraklitiki**](oktoich.md), the [**Triodion**](triodion.md)*,* and the [**Pentecostarion***.*](pentecos.md)

The illustration shows three of the great Hymnographers of the Church, who span over one thousand years of its history, St Kosmas of Maiouma and St John of Damascus of the 8th century and St Nikodemos of the Holy Mountain of the 18th.

The background is the Emperor Justinian’s cross from the last quarter of the sixth century.
