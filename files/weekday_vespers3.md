WEEKDAY VESPERS
===============

ON SUNDAY EVENING

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **Prosomia of the Lord.**

Tone 4. As noblest of Martyrs.

Come wretched soul, utterly profane, fall down before God and cry with fervent tears, ‘I have sinned’. Make the Judge merciful before the end and cry out to him from the heart, ‘My God, do not reject my groans, do not disregard the breaking of my heart, O Lord of infinite compassion’.

By night and day the all-evil enemy makes war on me and does not stop ensnaring me. He drags me to destruction, to deep pits of wickedness; but as you alone are good, my Jesu, rescue me from his tyranny and from every constraint, and save me, O supremely good, from punishments of many kinds.

I have become a dwelling-place of thoughts which afflict me and alienate me from you, my Master. I have set aside your commandments, I have never wanted to do your will; but be well-pleased to dwell in me, O Lord, through the multitude of your mercy, and teach me to do your will, for you are good and love humankind.

****

Of the Bodiless Powers. The same melody.

You prepared the armies and godlike ranks of the Angels as acceptable dwellings and all honoured vessels of the divine radiance, to contemplate your glory and to stand around your throne, as with strength they powerfully fulfil your word, and diligently perform your commands, O Lover of humankind.

Wishing to reveal yourself, who are without beginning, as an ocean of loving-kindness, you first created by your all-powerful will and your divine command the choirs of Angels and the ranks of Powers; for truly it was necessary for the good to be outpoured and to journey forth, and for your gifts to be multiplied, O Master.

Six-winged Seraphim, many-eyed Cherubim and exalted Thrones attend you, sharing directly in your light-giving radiance. Dominions, Principalities, Authorities, Archangels, Angels and divine Powers hymn your glory as they intercede with you on our behalf.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. Same.**

As you have gained unsleeping intercession and abiding advocacy with the Lord, All-pure Maiden, put to sleep the temptations of my wretched soul, calm its waves and comfort my heart in its affliction, I beseech you, and give grace to my mind that I may fittingly glorify you.

****

Aposticha of Compunction.

I wanted to wipe out the record of my offences, Lord, with tears and to be well-pleasing to you for the rest of my life through repentance; but the enemy tricks me and wars on my soul. O Lord, before I am finally destroyed, save me.

****

Verse 1.

To you I lift up my eyes, to you who are enthroned in the heavens. As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master: or as the eyes of a maid toward the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God: until he show us his mercy.

Who is storm-tossed and takes refuge in this harbour and is not saved? Or who is in pain and hastens to this place of healing and is not cured? Creator of all things and Physician of the sick, O Lord, before I am finally destroyed, save me.

****

Verse 2.

Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we have our fill of derision; our soul has its fill. Mockery for those at ease: and derision for the proud. ****

Of the Martyrs

Christ our God, glorified by the memorials of your Saints, implored by them send down upon us your great mercy.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Hail Cloud of light, hail shining Lampstand, Jar of the Manna, hail Aaron’s Rod, hail Bush unburned, hail Lamp, hail Throne, hail holy Mountain, hail Paradise, hail divine Table, hail mystic Gate, hail hope of all!

ON MONDAY EVENING

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **Stichera of Compunction, Prosomia to the Master.**

Tone 4. Called from the Highest.

Rivalling the woman of Canaan, my soul, from behind cling fast to Christ and cry again and again, ‘Have mercy on me, Master. I have no child, but unruly flesh, tormented by demons. Drive out from it, I beg, the burning fever, calm its unruly surges and deaden it finally through fear of you, O Christ, at the supplications of the one who in purity conceived you and gave birth to you and of all your Saints, O Benefactor full of mercy’.

You once sent Jonas out, O Christ, to preach to the sinful Ninevites. They repented and changed rage to pity, and were delivered from destroying wrath. Lover of humankind, send me also, your unworthy servant, your mighty help, that I may turn from my countless offences, be guided into paths of repentance and weep as I groan bitterly to be delivered from my many faults by your mercy.

You came into the world to save sinful mortals, and to call them to repentance, as you are compassionate. Have pity on me also, who have angered you more than all, O Full of pity; save me through your loving kindness, guide me to the way of repentance, give me thoughts of compunction, making my heart humble, simple, uncritical and meek by your grace, my Saviour, as you are compassionate.

****

Other Stichera of the Forerunner. You have given as a sign*.*

By your intercessions, blessed John, enlighten my soul, blackened by the malice of the serpent, and guide it, I beseech you, to walk on even paths, which lead to the blessed life, that I, your unprofitable servant, obtaining my request, may ever fervently glorify you, O all-wonderful.

As you are a shoot of a barren woman, honoured Forerunner, in repentance I implore you, O all-blessed, by your prayers make my soul, barren of every kind of good deed, offer fruits to God; so that I, your unprofitable servant, may be saved and so magnify your deeds of valour and your fervent protection.

Judge most just, Lover of humankind, who know the heart, and God, who do not remember evil, in the hour of judgement do not put me, the prodigal, to shame, O Word, but now be swayed by the holy intercessions of the godlike Baptist and save me in my cowardice, I implore and beg, O Jesu, supremely loving and the Saviour of our souls.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. Same melody.**

I have become a new Esau in every way, O Most Pure, subject to passions more than all, I alone appear wretched, I alone wholly bare of godly virtue. Who then will not weep for me? Who will not lament my loss? And so before the end I cry to you, ‘I have sinned, Sovereign Lady, save me, as once your Son saved the Prodigal’.

****

Aposticha of Compunction.

I wanted, Lord, to wipe away the record of my faults with tears, and for the rest of my life to be pleasing to you through repentance; but the enemy deceives me and wars against my soul. O Lord, before I am finally destroyed, save me!

Who is storm-tossed and takes refuge in this harbour and is not saved? Or who is in pain and hastens to this place of healing and is not cured? Creator of all things and Physician of the sick, O Lord, before I am finally destroyed, save me.

****

Of the Martyrs.

As you accepted the holy Martyrs’ endurance, accept from us a song of praise, O Lover of mankind, and at their supplications grant us your great mercy.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. You have given as a sign.**

I implore you, O All-praised, most pure palace of the King, purify my mind, stained with every fault, and make it a pleasant dwelling for the divine Trinity; that I, your unprofitable servant, may magnify your power and great compassion.

ON TUESDAY EVENING

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **Prosomia of the Cross.**

Tone 4. You have given as a sign.

When you first created me from earth, Lover of humankind, you honoured me with your own image, granting me the delight of Paradise; and when I was tricked by the tree of knowledge and fell into corruption, you raised me up again, you, the Immortal, becoming mortal and being crucified through your infinite mercy and profound loving descent.

My Maker and Lord through measureless pity, without leaving his Begetter, came to dwell on earth, emptying himself, and as he is good taking the form of a servant from the Virgin, as he was well-pleased, and he, the immortal, endured Crucifixion, suffering in the flesh, and he abolished death and saved humankind.

When in your compassion you were crucified, O Master, you crucified sin with yourself. You wiped out the curse by the piercing of the nails and tore up the record of the Forefather by being pierced in the side with a lance. I sing the praise of your sufferings, I glorify your Rising, through which you have given life to all who have been slain by the passions.

****

Of the Mother of God. The same.

Wipe clean the stain of my wretched heart, All-praised Mother of God, and cleanse its wounds and the sores which come from sin, pure Virgin, and steady my unstable mind; that I, your wretched and unprofitable servant, may magnify your power and your great assistance.

All-Blameless Virgin Mother, change the feebleness and slackness of my soul to strength and power, to carry out and perform with fear and love Christ’s statutes, that I may flee from the unquenchable fire and through you receive the heavenly inheritance and life without end, and be always filled with joy.

The fearful gloom of death wears out my soul, O Bride of God, while the reckoning of the demons ever prepares to astound and make it tremble. Deliver me from them, loving Virgin, who did not know wedlock, and place me in the harbour of salvation and the light of the saints that knows no evening.

Glory. Both now.

**Cross-Theotokion. Same melody.**

The all-pure Lady, as she watched Christ being put to death and putting the trickster to death, lamented and cried out bitterly to the One who had come from her womb. Marvelling at his long-suffering she was astounded, ‘My child so dearly loved, do not forget your servant, do not prolong my distress, O Lover of humankind’.

****

Aposticha of the Cross.

An invincible weapon you have given us, O Christ: your Cross, and with it we conquer all the assaults of the opponent.

Always having your Cross, O Christ, as help, we easily trample down the snares of the foe.

****

Of the Martyrs.

As you have freedom to speak before the Saviour, O Saints, intercede unceasingly for us sinners, asking forgiveness of offences and for our souls his great mercy.

Glory. Both now.

**Cross-Theotokion.**

As noblest of martyrs

When the Ewe-lamb who bore you saw you, the Lamb and Shepherd, on the Tree she grieved and as a mother cried aloud to you, ‘My Son so dearly loved, is this how the disobedient people who enjoyed your greatest wonders repays you? But glory to your ineffable and divine condescension, O Lover of mankind!’

WEDNESDAY EVENING.

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **Prosomia of the Apostles.**

Tone 4. As noblest of Martyrs.

Campaigning with valiant resolution, glorious Apostles, nobly armed with the panoply of the Spirit, you were ranged in battle against the boaster, and destroying all the might of the demons you snatched away like booty the souls of men; therefore we honour you for ever.

Unfurling the net of Faith in the form of the Cross, the godly company of the twelve Apostles caught up all the nations to true knowledge, O Christ, and dried up the salt seas of the passions; therefore I beg you, at their all acceptable prayers call me back from the deep of offences.

Let the godly and all honoured company of the twelve Apostles be praised today in godly songs, Peter and Paul, James, Luke, John and Matthew and Thomas, Mark, Simon and Philip, and now let glorious Andrew be glorified with the godly and wise Bartholomew, and the rest of the Seventy.

****

Others, of St Nicholas.

The divine grace of the Spirit anointed you with divine myrrh, most holy Nicholas, who presided over Myra and shed sweet fragrance over the ends of the earth by your virtues, by your sweet scented prayers everywhere dispelling the foul smelling passions; therefore in faith we praise you and celebrate your all holy memory.

As an unsetting beacon, a lamp for the whole world shining in the firmament of the Church, O Nicholas, and lighting the world, driving out the fog of dire dangers, banishing the winter of despair and creating deep calm, we fittingly call you blessed.

Both present in person and appearing in dreams, most holy Father Nicholas, you saved those about to die unjustly, as compassionate, as lover of good, as fervent deliverer, as true champion of those who ask your help in faith, fellow citizen of the Angels, equal of Saints and Prophets.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion. Same melody.**

You contained God the uncontainable in your womb, when he became man in love for humankind and, taking our matter from you, made it divine. Do not despise me, All Pure One, in my present trouble, but swiftly take pity on me and free me from every wile and harm of the evil one.

****

Aposticha of the Apostles.

You enlightened the choir of the Apostles, O Christ, with the Holy Spirit; through them cleanse us also from the stain of sin and have mercy on us.

The Holy Spirit, Christ our God, declared the unlettered Disciples to be teachers, and by the many voiced harmony of the tongues abolished error, for you are all powerful.

Martyrs of the Lord, sacred, living, spiritual holocausts, perfect sacrifices for God, knowing God, and known to God as his sheep, whose fold is impenetrable for wolves, intercede that we too may be pastured with you by the water of rest.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Deliver us from our constraints, Mother of Christ our God, who bore the Maker of all things; that we may all cry to you, ‘Hail only protection of our souls!’

ON THURSDAY EVENING

****

At

Lord, I have cried, **Prosomia of the Cross.**

Tone 4. You have given as a sign.

When all creation saw you crucified, O long-suffering Word, it was changed and trembled, while the earth, all shaken, quaked; the veil of the temple was rent by fear when you were mocked, and rocks were split from fear and the sun withdrew its rays, knowing you their Maker.

The eternal record of Adam the forefather was torn up when your side was pierced, Most Merciful, and rejected human nature was made holy by the drops of your blood, as it cried: Glory to your power, glory to your divine Crucifixion, Jesu all-powerful, the Saviour of our souls.

How does the lawless people dare to condemn you, the immortal Judge, who in the wilderness of old traced out the law for Moses who saw God? How, as they saw the Life of all dead upon a Tree, were they not utterly astounded, did not consider in their minds that you alone were lord and Master of creation?

****

Of the Mother of God. The same

Sovereign Lady, take on me who am being battered by the assaults of demons and thrust into the pit of destruction, and establish on a rock of virtues and scattering the devices of the ill-intentioned make me worthy to do the commands of your Son and our God, that I may obtain forgiveness on the day of judgement.

I have fallen among murderous thieves, All-blameless Maiden, and I have been stripped of the incorruptible garment of the splendour on high by their attacks. I have been mercilessly wounded by them and have been thrown down half dead in a place of evil. But hasten, stretch out your hand and raise me up I implore.

I lie on a bed of indifference, I pass my life in sloth and I fear the moment of my end, Mother of God, lest like a lion the all-evil serpent mercilessly rend my wretched soul. Therefore in your loving kindness hasten and rouse me to repentance before the end.

Glory. Both now.

**Cross-Theotokion. Same melody.**

Seeing you hanged upon a tree, O Lover of mankind, the sun and the moon hid their rays, my Christ, O Sun of righteousness, and the foundations of the earth were shaken in fear of your might. But your Mother, wounded to her very core, cried out to you: Most loving Jesu, glory to your compassion.

****

Aposticha of the Cross.

An invincible weapon you have given us, O Christ: your Cross, and with it we conquer all the assaults of the opponent.

Always having your Cross, O Christ, as help, we easily trample down the snares of the foe.

****

Of the Martyrs.

Christ God, glorified by the memories of your Saints, entreated by them send down upon us your great mercy.

Glory. Both now.

**Cross-Theotokion*.***

Do not mourn for me, Mother, as you watch your Son and God hanging upon a tree, who hung the earth unchecked upon the waters and fashioned all creation; for I shall arise and be glorified and smash with strength the palaces of Hades, and I shall make its power vanish and in my compassion free the prisoners of its wickedness and bring them to my own Father, as I love mankind.

ON FRIDAY EVENING

****

At

Lord I have cried, **Prosomia to the Lord.**

Tone 4. I wanted to wipe away.

O Lord, my God, destroy the deadly passions of my heart; for if you pull down a house of the flesh and build a house of the spirit, in vain does he who wars against my soul keep watch. O Lord, before I am finally destroyed, save me.

You have given me the foe, O Merciful, as a gift and as a scourge of instruction for my advantage; for his wickedness co-operates with me in a choice which is not right for good; while I do not flee to you through grateful prayer. O Lord, before I am finally destroyed, save me.

You accepted Passion and death for me, that, as Giver of life, you might free me from passions and the corruption of death, and restore to me my former dispassion; therefore, O Saviour, raise me as I lie in the tomb of sin before eternal death seizes me.

Others, of the Mother of God. Same.

Lady, Sovereign Lady, deliver me from base and filthy desires, for they befoul the senses of my soul and body; therefore, O Pure one, I entreat you, as I cry in repentance: Sovereign Lady, before I am finally destroyed, save me.

Alas! What will become of me, what can I do, enslaved as I am to the passions since my youth? Shall I be able even in old age to show Christ fruits of repentance? It is my accustomed habit even more than the deceiver that deceives me. Sovereign Lady, before I am finally destroyed, save me.

Give me tears, O Mother of God, and make for me a broken heart, grant me, too, confession of my life-long faults, that with your help I may pass the remaining time of my life in repentance and find remission.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

The Prophet David, through you the ancestor of God, spoke of you in song beforehand to him who has done great things for you, ‘The Queen stood at your right hand’. For he, the God who was well pleased without father to become man from you, declared you to be mother, source of life, that he might refashion his own image, corrupted by passions, and, having found the lost sheep wandering on the mountain and laid it on his shoulders, he might bring it to his Father; and by his own will unite it to the heavenly Powers and save the world, O Mother of God, Christ who has great and rich mercy.

****

Aposticha of the Martyrs.

You accepted the Martyrs’ endurance, O Lover of mankind, accept too our hymn of praise, granting us at their intercessions your great mercy.

****

Verse 1:

God is wonderful in his Saints.

O Saints who have boldness towards the Saviour, intercede unceasingly for us sinners, asking forgiveness of our offences, and for our souls his great mercy.

****

Verse 2:

For the Saints in his land the Lord has done wonders.

Living victims, spiritual holocausts, Martyrs of the Lord, perfect sacrifices to God, knowing God and known to God, sheep whose fold is impenetrable by wolves, intercede that we too may be numbered in your flock by the water of repose.

****

Verse 3:

Blessed are those whom you have chosen and taken; they will dwell in your courts. ****

Of the Dead.

With the spirits of the righteous made perfect in death give rest, O Saviour, to the souls of your servants; keeping them for the life of blessedness with you, O Lover of mankind.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

As we have you as hope and protection, O Mother of God, we are not afraid of the assaults of enemies, for you save our souls.
