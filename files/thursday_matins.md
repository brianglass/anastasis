**Troparia.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">I am condemned, I am beyond correction, for I have despised your ordinances and followed in mad folly the wiles of the demons. Turn me back again, O Lord, at the prayers of your Apostles.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Glorious Apostles, blessed Apostles, Disciples of the Saviour, all-wise Heralds, rescue me from all harm, all wrath, all sin, all disaster and transgression of every kind.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">I offer a soul beyond correction, a conscience buried beneath the stuff of offences, a heart defiled and thought befouled. I cry to you, Lover of mankind: Take pity on me in your mercy.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">All-pure Virgin, the Apostles proclaimed your Son to all the world as God and Man. Therefore with them entreat that on the dread day of judgement all those who faithfully magnify you may be delivered.</span>

**Of the Saint. The same Irmos.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Illumined by the lamps of grace, inspired Father, and having become a wise beacon of true religion, you save those in temptations, rescue those in the depth of the sea and wondrously nourish the starving, O all-blessed.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Now encamped in the Paradise of delight and contemplating clearly the ineffable glory, you look from the vaults of heaven upon those who sing your praises and rescue them from passions, all-honoured God-bearer.</span>

**Theotokion.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Pure Mother of God, you conceived the Wisdom, Power and empersonned Word of the Father, Wisdom which took its temple from your immaculate blood, and was united to, by a union that was unbroken.</span>

**At the Aposticha of Lauds, of the Apostles.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">You have magnified the names of the Princes of the Apostles in the inhabited world, O Saviour. They learned the ineffable mysteries of heaven, they gave healings to those on earth, and their shadows alone cured the passions. The one who was a fisherman worked wonders; the one who was a Jew taught the doctrines of grace. Through them, O Compassionate, grant us your great mercy.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">We who are warred upon from every side and take refuge in you, who alone are truly God, offer you the words of your Disciples as we say: Save us, Teacher, we are perishing. Show now also to our enemies, we beg, that you protect your people and save them from dangers at the intercession of the Apostles, overlooking their sins through your great goodness. Lord, glory to you.</span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Every city, town and village honours your relics, Martyrs and Champions; for you struggled like professionals and received a heavenly crown, and therefore you are the boast of priests, the victory of Kings and the splendour of Churches.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Glory. Both now.<span style="color:red"> Theotokion.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Joy of all the afflicted and defence of the wronged, nourishment of the hungry and consolation of strangers, harbour of the storm-tossed, visitation of the sick, shelter and assistance of the oppressed and staff of the blind, Mother of God Most High; therefore we all fall down before you, deliver us from every calamity.</span>

AT THE LITURGY
--------------

**The Beatitudes.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">We bring you the words of the Thief and we cry to you: Remember us, Saviour, in your Kingdom.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">All-wise Apostles, you passed through all the regions of the world and delivered mortals from the darkness of error.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">With the net of grace, wise Initiates, you clearly drew up humans from the deep of vain folly.</span>

**Of the Martyrs.**

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Champions of Christ, who finished the course and kept the faith, with one accord we let us sing your praise.</span>

Glory.

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Let all us believers now glorify in fear the Son, equal in operation with the Begetter, together with the Spirit.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Both now.<span style="color:red"> Theotokion.</span></span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">Pure Virgin, you are the boast of Apostles, ornament of Athletes and salvation of the world.</span>
