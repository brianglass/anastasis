# CATECHESIS 40

That we should conduct ourselves in newness of life,  
just as we promised through the holy Schema.[\[1\]](#_ftn1)

Brethren and Fathers, just as the hungry long to eat and the thirsty to
drink, so we should be enthusiastic to listen to the word of God. For by
listening we gain the greatest benefits. If we are slothful, we put away
sloth; if we are eager, we become even more eager; and from both the
outcome is good. What then is the present word? *For, * says Scripture,
*this is how God loved the world: he gave his only Son, so that everyone
who believes in him may not perish but have eternal
life*[\[2\]](#_ftn2)*.* Nor did he simply give him, but *even to death,
death on a cross*[\[3\]](#_ftn3). How? We were enslaved to the devil
through Adam’s transgression, we were under the reign of death, sold
under sin[\[4\]](#_ftn4), guilty and captive, subject to corruption.
Therefore the only Son of God came, giving himself as a ransom for all.
He not only delivered us from death’s possession, but also, having
washed *us from our sins by his own blood, he made us a kingdom (of
heaven) and priests to his God and Father.*[\[5\]](#_ftn5) Have you seen
the mighty love of his strength? Have you seen the measureless mercy of
his love for humanity? How unsearchable are his mercies and inscrutable
his acts of compassion[\[6\]](#_ftn6), which *he has poured out on us
through Jesus Christ our Saviour\!*[\[7\]](#_ftn7) What may we, poor
wretches, say to all this? What may we think? Shall we willingly return
to sin? Shall we long for dishonour? Shall we choose corruption and
condemnation? *By no means,* says the Apostle, *we have died to sin, how
shall we continue to live in it? Or are you ignorant that as many of us
as were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death. We were
buried then with him through baptism to death, so that, just as Christ
was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too might
walk in newness of life*.[\[8\]](#_ftn8) So, brothers, let us walk in
newness of life, just as we promised when we took the habit. Let us
conduct ourselves with righteousness and holiness, *as befits
saints*[\[9\]](#_ftn9) with peace and harmony, with reverence and piety,
with holiness and dispassion, not being led away *in ignorance by our
former[\[10\]](#_ftn10)* deceits, but fleeing our former notions like
fire and standing fast on the rock of our faith. This is *newness*. And
what is ‘oldness’? Indulgence, by which Adam our forefather was caught
and became an outcast from Paradise and underwent a life of much grief.
Envy, by which Cain was inflamed and murdered his brother Abel because
his gifts were preferred, and as a result he passed his whole life in
fear and groaning. From these two sins ten thousand evils surfaced in
the world. Because of these the Flood utterly wiped out all the high
ground of the earth. Because of these Sodom and Gomorra were reduced to
ashes by fire and brimstone as a warning to the impious. Do you see what
sin has brought about *and the desire of the eyes and pride in one’s way
of life*.[\[11\]](#_ftn11) But nevertheless, as has been said before, we
have been called by God’s mercy, we have gained freedom, we have run to
be adopted as sons. Let us then stand with the freedom with which Christ
has freed us, and let us be guarded by the glory with which Christ has
glorified us, spitting on everything that belongs to empty vanity,
reckoning them all secondary for the sake Christ: dishonour as honour,
affliction as joy, blows as pleasures, persecution as happiness, death
as life, just as our holy fathers and brothers, * whose names are in the
book of life*,[\[12\]](#_ftn12) whom we have remembered today, chose to
do. For if we too live like this, we shall appear here *like beacons in
the world, holding on to the word of life*,[\[13\]](#_ftn13) while in
the age to come we shall inherit the kingdom of heaven in Christ Jesus
our Lord, to whom be glory and might with the Father and the Holy
Spirit, now and ever , and to the ages of ages.

[\[1\]](#_ftnref1) The manuscripts give no particular date for this
Instruction, but its place, between Theophany and Lent, and the
reference in the last paragraph to ‘our holy fathers and brothers, who
have been commemorated by us today’ strongly suggest that it was given
on the Saturday before Cheese Sunday. The references to Adam and his
banishment from Paradise, the theme of the next day’s services, support
this.

[\[2\]](#_ftnref2) John 3:16

[\[3\]](#_ftnref3) Phil. 2:8.

[\[4\]](#_ftnref4) Cf. Romans 7:14, which is alluded to in the Anaphora
of St Basil in a similar context in the first person plural. It may be
that St Theodore has the Anaphora in mind here, rather than Romans.

[\[5\]](#_ftnref5) Apocalypse 1:5-6. St Theodore is probably quoting
from memory The word ‘heaven’ is not in the text of the Apocalypse. The
standard Byzantine text has ‘kings’, rather than ‘kingdom’, which is the
accepted reading in modern critical editions. It is also that underlying
the Vulgate’s ‘regnum’. The Latin in Migne does not include the word.

[\[6\]](#_ftnref6) Cf. Romans 11:33.

[\[7\]](#_ftnref7) Titus 3:6.

[\[8\]](#_ftnref8) Romans 6:2-4.

[\[9\]](#_ftnref9) Ephesians 5:3.

[\[10\]](#_ftnref10) 1 Peter 1:14. St Theodore replaces ‘desires’ by
‘deceits’.

[\[11\]](#_ftnref11) 1 John 2:16. The Greek *bios* is not easy to
translate here. Some translators go so far as to put ‘riches’. Perhaps
‘style of life’, ‘standard of living’.

[\[12\]](#_ftnref12) Philippians 4;3.

[\[13\]](#_ftnref13) Philippians 2:15-16.
