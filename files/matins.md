THE THIRD SUNDAY IN LENT

****

THE ADORATION OF THE PRECIOUS AND LIFE-GIVING CROSS

AT MATINS

****

After the usual readings from the Psalter, the Kathismata of the Resurrection in the Tone of the week. After the Polyeleos and the Evlogitaria, the following Kathisma of the Cross:

Tone 8.

In Paradise of old the enemy stripped me naked by a tree, for by my tasting it he brought in death. But now the Tree of the Cross, that bears the clothing of life for mortals, has been fixed on the earth, and the whole world filled with every joy. Seeing it worshipped, you peoples, let us with one accord raise our cry to God with faith, ‘His house is full of glory!’

Glory. Both now.

**The same again.**

Then the Anavathmi and the Prokeimenon in the Tone of the week and the appointed Morning Gospel. We then sing

Having seen the Resurrection of Christ**, followed by Psalm 50, and then, as on previous Sundays,** Open to me, O Giver of Life. ****

The Canons

Four Troparia, including the Irmos, from the Canon of the Resurrection and two from the Canon to the Mother of God, in the Tone of the week from the Oktoichos; and then the Canon of the Triodion by St. Theodore the Studite, with eight troparia.

Ode 1. Tone 1. The day of Resurrection

A day of festival! At Christ’s Rising, death has fled away and the light of life has dawned. Adam has arisen and dances for joy. Therefore let us cry aloud as we sing a song of victory.

A day of worship of the Precious Cross! Come, let all approach it! For now it is set forth, shining with the bright beams of Christ’s Rising. Let us kiss it, as we rejoice in soul.

Great Cross of the Lord, appear! Show me now the divine vision of your beauty, and make me your worthy worshipper. For I address you and embrace you as though you were alive.

Let heaven and earth give praise with one accord, for the all-blessed Cross, on which Christ, nailed in the body, was sacrificed, is now set forth for all. Let us kiss it as we rejoice in soul.

Glory.

O Trinity in Persons, O Unity in Essence, Father, Son and Spirit, equal in power, Unity in purpose and will, dominion and rule, watch over your world and crown it with peace.

Both now.

**Theotokion**

Virgin who did not know man, you give birth to an infant without seed and the Offspring you bear is the Maker of all things, Christ our God. Entreat him to grant the whole universe peace.

Katavasia

The godlike Moses prefigured your Cross of old, when he led Israel through the Red Sea, cutting the water with his rod, your Cross; and he sang you a song of departure, Christ our God.

****

Ode 3. Come, let us drink a new drink.

Come, let us sing a new song, as we celebrate the overthrow of Hell, for Christ has risen from the tomb; capturing death, and saving the whole universe.

Come, believers, let us drink, not from a well that gushes water that perishes, but from the source of enlightenment, as we worship the Cross of Christ, in which we boast.

As with our hands we now embrace your Cross, which Moses of old prefigured with his outstretched arms, the invisible Amalek we put to flight, Christ our Master, through whom we shall be saved.

Believers, with pure eyes and lips let us worship in joy the Cross of the Lord, as we raise a song of exultation.

Glory.

I honour one God without beginning, in three Persons but undivided in Essence, the Father, the Son and the living Spirit, in whose Name we have been baptized.

Kathismata of the Cross

Your Cross, O Lord, has been made holy, for by it comes healing to those who are in sick in sins. Though it we fall down before you. Have mercy upon us.

****

Verse:

Exalt the Lord our God. And fall down before his footstool, for he is holy (**Psalm 98: 5**)*.*

Today the words of the Prophet have been fulfilled: for see, we worship at the place on which your feet have stood, Lord; and tasting from the Tree of salvation, we have been delivered from our sinful passions at the prayers of the Mother of God, only lover of humankind.

Glory.

No sooner had the Tree of your Cross been set up, Christ our Lord, than the foundations of death were shaken. Hell swallowed you eagerly, but it let you go with trembling. You have shown us your salvation, O Holy One, and we glorify you, Son of God. Have mercy on us.

****

Theotokion

Virgin Mother of God, implore your Son, Christ our God, who was nailed on the Cross of his own will, and rose from the dead, that our souls may be saved.

Ode 4. Let the Prophet Avvakoum

See, Christ has risen’, said the Angel to the Myrrhbearing Women, ‘Do not lament, but go, say to the Apostles, ‘Rejoice, today is the salvation of the world; for by death the tyranny of the enemy has been destroyed.’

As we celebrate today the joyful worship of your life-bearing Cross, O Christ, we prepare ourselves for your most holy Passion; for you achieved it for the salvation of the world, O Saviour, as all-powerful.

Today there is joy in heaven and on earth, for the sign of the Cross is made manifest to the world. The thrice-blessed Cross is set before us, and to all who worship it it is a fount of ever-flowing grace.

What shall we offer you, O Christ? For you have given us your Precious Cross to worship, on which your all-holy Blood was poured out, and to which your flesh was fixed by nails. As with love we kiss it we give you thanks.

Glory.

I sing the praises of the three Persons in one Godhead, one simple Nature undivided, as I proclaim: Father without beginning, Son and Holy Spirit, equal in throne, one lordship, equal Kingship, one everlasting Might.

****

Theotokion

You alone among women, pure Lady, were revealed as a marvellous and fearful thing. For you made nature new, conceiving without seed and still remaining as before a virgin; for the one born from you is true God.

****

Katavasia

Seeing you, upon the Cross, O powerful Lord, the great light was seized with fear withdrew and hid its rays; with dread the whole creation sang the praise of your longsuffering, for the earth too was filled with your praise.

****

Ode 5. Let us arise in the early dawn

You dawned form the tomb, O Light that never sets, and made incorruption blaze forth on the world. In your compassion you banished the darkness of death from the ends of the earth.

Cleansed by self-mastery, let us draw near, as with praise we fervently embrace the all-holy Tree on which Christ crucified saved the world in his compassion.

Today the ranks of angels dance with gladness at the worship of your Cross. For through it you shattered the regiments of devils, O Christ, so saving humankind.

The Church has been revealed as a second Paradise, having within it, as of old, a Tree that bears life, your Cross, O Lord. By touching it we share in immortality.

Glory.

I glorify Three without beginning, God in one Essence, Father, Son and Spirit, a single Light in threefold radiance, Kingdom of equal might in identity without confusion.

Both now.

Having crushed death, O Christ, you rose as a great King, calling us back from the storehouses of Hell to the enjoyment of the Kingdom of Heaven, to the land of immortality.

Believers, let us cry aloud in godly songs and shout with joy to God, as we greet the Cross of the Lord; for it is a fountain of holiness to all those in the world.

The saying of the writer of songs is fulfilled: for see, we worship at the footstool of your most pure feet, all-powerful Lord, your Precious Cross, the thrice-longed for Tree.

The wood which the Prophet of lamentation saw cast into your bread, — your Cross, compassionate Lord — we greet and we sing in praise of your bonds and tomb, of the lance and nails

The holy Cross, O Christ, which you accepted to bear on your shoulders, and on it to be lifted up and crucified in the flesh, we kiss; and from it we gather strength against invisible foes.

Glory.

A Unity in three Persons I praise and a Trinity worshipped in one Nature, God the three in one, Light of triple sun, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Both now.

Kontakion. Tone 7. \[By St Romanos\]

****

Ikos.

Three crosses Pilate fixed on Golgotha, Two for the thieves and one for the Giver of life, Whom Hades saw and said to those below, ‘My ministers and powers, Who has fixed a nail in my heart? A wooden lance has suddenly pierced me and I am being torn apart. My insides are in pain, my belly in agony. My senses make my spirit tremble, And I am compelled to disgorge Adam and Adam’s race, given me by a tree, A tree is bringing them back Again to Paradise’.

****

Ode 7. He who delivered the Young Men

You rose on the third day from the tomb as one who slept, Lord, and by your divine power struck down the gatekeepers of hell; you raised up all our forebears from of old, O God of our fathers, alone blessed and greatly glorified.

Today, you peoples, as we dance and sing to the harp, let us greatly rejoice at the worship of the Cross, glorifying Christ who was nailed upon it, the God of our fathers, alone blessed and greatly glorified.
