ON THE 29TH OF THE MONTH
========================

<span style="color:red;font-weight:normal">Commemoration of the Beheading of the holy glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist John</span>

AT VESPERS
----------

<span style="color:red">After the Opening Psalm we recite the first Section of</span> ** Blessed is the man*.* <span style="color:red">At </span>Lord, I have cried <span style="color:red">we insert 6 Idiomel Stichera, doubling the first two.</span>

<span style="color:red">Tone 6. By Monk John.</span>

As shameless Herod’s birthday was being celebrated the terms of the oath to the wanton dancing girl were fulfilled; for the head of the Forerunner was struck off and brought in on a dish like a delicacy for those at table. O hateful banquet, full of impious behaviour and bloodthirsty murder! But we, as we fittingly honour the Baptist as greatest among the offspring of women, call him blessed.

**Same Tone.**

She danced, the disciple of the all-evil devil, and took your head, O Forerunner, as her wages. O banquet filled with blood! If only you had not sworn, lawless Herod, offspring of falsehood. But if you had sworn, if only you had not kept your oath; for it was better to have lied and attained life, than to speak truly and to cut off the head of the Forerunner. But we, as we fittingly honour the Baptist as greatest among the offspring of women, call him blessed.

**Same Tone.**

You should not, Herod, have condemned to death the one who denounced your adultery, the result of satanic love and the insane passion of lust for a woman. You should not have perilously handed over his all-honoured head to a lawless woman because of an oath made for a dance. How did you dare to accomplish such a murder? How was the wanton dancing girl not consumed by fire in the middle of the banquet as she brought this head in on a dish? But we, as we fittingly honour the Baptist as greatest among the offspring of women, call him blessed.

**Same Tone.**

Once again Herodias rages, once again she is deranged. O deceitful dance and revelry with deceit! The Baptist was beheaded and Herod was troubled. At the prayers of your Forerunner, Lord, grant peace to our souls.

<span style="color:windowtext">Glory. </span>**Tone 6. By Monk John.**

As shameless Herod’s birthday was being celebrated the terms of the oath to the wanton dancing girl were fulfilled; for the head of the Forerunner was struck off and brought in on a dish like a delicacy for those at table. O hateful banquet, full of impious behaviour and bloodthirsty murder! But we, as we fittingly honour the Baptist as greatest among the offspring of women, call him blessed.

<span style="color:windowtext">Both now. </span>**Theotokion.**

Who will not call you blessed, All-holy Virgin? Who will not hymn your child-birth without labour? For the only-begotten Son, who shone from the Father beyond time, came forth from you, pure Maiden, ineffably incarnate. By nature he is God, by nature he became man for our sakes, not divided in a duality of persons, but known without confusion in a duality of natures. O honoured and all-blessed, implore him to have mercy on our souls.

<span style="color:red">Entrance, </span>O Joyful Light,<span style="color:red"> the prokeimenon of the day and the Readings.</span>

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Isaias.
\[<span style="color:red">40:1 and selection</span>\]

Thus says the Lord: Comfort, comfort my people, says God. Priests, speak to the heart of Jerusalem. Comfort her, because her humiliation has been completed; for her has sin has been abolished, because she has received from the Lord’s hand double for her sins. A voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God. Every valley will be filled and every mountain and hill made low; what is crooked will become straight, and the rough ways will be made smooth; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God. Go up onto a high mountain, you who bring good tidings to Sion; lift up your voice with strength, you who bring good tidings to Jerusalem. Lift it up, do not be afraid. I the Lord God, I, the God of Israel, will hearken and will not forsake them; but I will open rivers from the mountains and springs in the middle of plains. I will turn the wilderness into water meadows and the thirsty earth with water courses. Let the heavens rejoice from on high and let the clouds rain justice. Let the earth sprout and blossom with mercy and justice. Announce a voice of gladness to the end of the earth and let this be heard: Say that the Lord has delivered his servant Jacob. And if they thirst through deserts, he will bring water for them from a rock. Rejoice you barren who have never given birth, break out and shout, you who have never known birth pangs, for the children of the deserted are more than those of her who has a husband.

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Malachy.
\[<span style="color:red">3 & 4 and selection</span>\]

Thus says the Lord Almighty: See, I am sending my Angel, my messenger, before your face, who will prepare your way before you. And the Lord whom you seek will come to his temple. And who will endure the day of his entrance? And who will withstand at his appearing? Because he will enter like fire in a smelting furnace and like the lye of launderers. And he will come to you in judgement; and he will be a swift witness against the wicked and against adulteresses and against those swear falsely in his name and those who do not fear him, says the Lord Almighty. Because I am the Lord your God, and I have not changed and you, children of Jacob, have perverted the laws and not kept them. Therefore turn back to me and I will turn back to you, says the Lord Almighty. And all the nations will call you blessed and you will know that I am the Lord who discern between just and lawless on the day on which I make a peculiar possession of those who love me. Know then and remember the law of Moses my servant, as I gave him commandment on Horeb, to all Israel ordinances and judgements. And see, I will send you Elias the Thesbite, before the great and manifest day of the Lord comes; he will turn again the heart of father to son and of a man to his neighbour, lest when I come I smite the earth grievously, says the Lord Almighty, God the Holy One of Israel.

The Reading is from the Wisdom of Solomon.
\[<span style="color:red">4:7, selection, & 5:1-7</span>\]

A just man if he comes to his end will be at rest. A just man who dies will condemn the ungodly who are alive; for they will see the end of a just man and will not understand what they counselled concerning him. For the Lord will break the ungodly, render them voiceless and cast them headlong, and he will shake them from the foundations and they will be utterly worsted in sorrow, and their memory shall perish. They shall come with fear at the accounting of their sins, and their iniquities will convict them to their face. Then the just will stand with much boldness in the face of those who afflicted him and made his toils of no account. When they see this they will be troubled with great fear and will be amazed at the wonder of his salvation. For they will say as they repent and with anguish they will groan and say: Is this he whom we fools once made a laughing stock and a byword of reproach? We reckoned his life folly and his end dishonour. How has he been numbered among the children of God and his lot with the Saints? Therefore we have erred from the way of truth and the light of righteousness has not shone on us and the sun has not dawned on us. We have been filled with paths of lawlessness and destruction and journeyed through trackless paths, but have not known the way of the Lord.

**At the Aposticha, Idiomel Stichera.
Tone 2.**

Herald of repentance, John Baptist, when your head was struck off you sanctified the earth; because you made clear God’s law to the faithful and utterly destroyed lawlessness. As you stand before the throne of Christ the King of heaven, implore him to have mercy on our souls.

<span style="color:red">Verse: </span>The righteous will flourish like the palm tree; be increased like the cedar in Lebanon. \[<span style="color:red">Ps. 91:12</span>\]

For the law of the Lord your head was struck off, all-holy John. With blameless boldness of speech you rebuked the impious king when he transgressed the law. And so the hosts of Angels marvel at you; the choirs of Apostles and Martyrs glorify you; we too honour your yearly memorial, as we glorify the Holy Trinity, who crowned you, blessed Forerunner.

<span style="color:red">Verse: </span>The just will rejoice in the Lord and hope in him; all the upright in heart will be praised. \[<span style="color:red">Ps. 63:10</span>\]

The Prophet from a Prophet, who became greater than the Prophets, who was sanctified from his mother’s womb for the service of the Lord, had his head struck off today by a lawless king; and both before his execution and after it clearly rebuking the maiden who danced licentiously, he put the regiment of sin to shame. And so we cry out: Baptist John, as you have freedom to speak, intercede insistently for our souls.

<span style="color:windowtext">Glory. </span>**Tone 8.**

Forerunner of the Saviour, you rebuked kings that they should not act lawlessly; and so the little darling of a lawless woman persuaded Herod to cut off your head, and therefore from the rising of the sun to its setting your name is to be praised. As you have freedom before the Lord intercede insistently for our souls.

<span style="color:windowtext">Both now. </span>**Theotokion.**

Virgin without bridegroom, who conceived God ineffably in the flesh, Mother of God Most High, accept the supplications of your servants, O all-blameless, who bestow on all cleansing from faults. Now accept our entreaties and implore that we may all be saved.

**Apolytikion. Tone 4.**

The just is remembered with praises, but for you the Lord’s testimony suffices, O Forerunner; for you were declared more praiseworthy than the Prophets, because you were found worthy to baptize in running streams the One they had proclaimed. Therefore, having struggled bravely for the truth with joy, you preached to those in Hell a God who had appeared in flesh, who takes away the sin of the world, and grants us his great mercy.

<span style="color:black">Both now.</span> **Theotokion**

All your mysteries are beyond understanding, all beyond glory, Mother of God; sealed in purity and guarded in virginity you were recognised to be truly a Mother, in giving birth to the true God. Implore him that our souls may be saved.

<span style="color:red">And Dismissal.</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal"></span>

AT MATINS
---------

**After the 1st reading from the Psalter, Kathisma.
Tone 5. The Word without beginning.**

The intermediary of law and grace let us the faithful, gathered together, praise with one accord, because he preached repentance to us and, when he openly and bravely denounced Herod, had his head struck off. And now he lives with the Angels and im­plores Christ that we may be saved.

<span style="color:windowtext">Glory. Both now.</span> ** **Theotokion*****.***

The astounding wonder of your con­ceiving and the ineffable birth-giving of your womb have been made known in you, pure Ever-Virgin. Your glory, Mother of God, which is unfurled over all for our salvation, amazes my mind and astounds my thought.

**After the 2nd Reading from the Psalter, Kathisma.
Tone 5. The Word without beginning.**

The one who was revealed to us as a Prophet from the womb and who came forth radiantly from a barren woman as a beacon for the inhabited world, the Baptist of Christ, the vic­torious athlete, the Forerunner John, let us praise in songs, for he inter­cedes with the Lord to have mercy on our souls.

**After the Polyeleos, Kathisma.
Tone 8. The Wisdom and Word.**

By God’s decree you shone out from the barren woman, broke open the bonds on your father’s tongue and revealed the Sun that shines with the light of dawn. And in the wilderness you preached the Creator to the peoples, the Lamb that takes away the faults of the world. There­fore too with fervour you rebuked the king and your head was struck off, famous and all-praised John. Intercede with Christ God to grant forgiveness of faults to those who celebrate with love your holy memory.

<span style="color:windowtext">Glory. Both now. </span>**Theotokion*****.***

All-holy Virgin, Mother of God, heal the dread passions of my soul, I beg, and grant me pardon of the faults that I have senselessly committed, defiling soul and body, wretch that I am. Alas! What shall I do in that hour when the Angels separate my soul from my wretched body? Sovereign Lady, be my help then and my ardent protector; for I, your servant, have you as my hope.

**The Anavathmi, the 1st Antiphon of Tone 4.**

**Prokeimenon. Tone 4.**

Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Holy One.

<span style="color:red">Verse</span>*:* <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>What return may we make to the Lord for that he has given us?

**Gospel according to Matthew.
(See Tuesday of the 7th week of Matthew)**

**Psalm 50, read.**

<span style="color:windowtext">Glory.</span>

At the prayers of the Forerunner, O Merciful One, blot out the multitude of my transgressions.

<span style="color:windowtext">Both now.</span>

At the prayers of the Mother of God, O Merciful One, blot out the multitude of my transgressions.

Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with your great mercy; according to the fullness of your compassion blot out my offences.

**Then the Idiomel. Tone 2.**

Herald of repentance, John Baptist, when you head was struck off you hallowed the earth; because you made clear God’s law to the faithful and utterly destroyed lawlessness. As you stand before the throne of Christ the King of heaven, implore him to have mercy on our souls.

<span style="color:red;font-style:normal">After this are sung the Canons; that of the [Mother of God](lparacan.md) \[from the Little Paraklesis\] to 6 and the following 2 of the Saint to 8.</span>

**First Canon of the Saint.
A composition of Monk John.
Ode 1. Tone 8. Crossing the sea.**

Let us sing praise of the Prophet who appeared from a barren womb, the sacred Forerunner of the One who was born ineffably from a virgin womb.

Though you had surpassed the bounds of nature, you preserved the laws of righteousness when you re­buked a lawless union, unafraid of the arrogance of kings.

Nourished on the milk of the law, sealing, like a seal of the law, the legislation of lawful union, you were confronted with licentious hate.

**Theotokion.**

Ranks of Angels and of mortals praise you without ceasing, Mother without bridegroom, for you carried in your arms as a babe their Creator.

**Second Canon.
Tone 8. With your mighty right hand.**

Let us all praise godlike John, to whom above all mortals Christ bore witness as his Forerunner and friend.

Let us all praise godlike John, the citizen of the desert and companion of the Angels, the boast of the new people.

At the memory of the Forerunner, let us all dance like the Angels and cry out to Christ: At his intercessions, O Christ, give peace to your world.

**Theotokion.**

At every moment, Mother of God, entreat God, who was incarnate from you by an ineffable word, to rescue your servants from every disaster.

**Katavasia.**

A Cross Moses traced out as he cut the Red Sea in a straight line with his rod for Israel as they marched on foot; and then united it again, overwhelming Pharao with his chariots, as with another line he marked out the invincible weapon. Therefore let us sing to Christ our God, for he has been glorified.

**Ode 3. You are the foundation.**

A dissolute girl, filled with drunken­ness, said, Give me here and now, Herod, the head of John on a dish.

The girl danced and as she delighted lawless Herod she lured him to the murder of the Forerunner and herald.

Wretch that you are, foolish and lawless Herod! By what insolence of a dissolute girl did you commit an unjust murder.

**Theotokion.**

Give us help by your intercessions, O All-pure, by driving off the assaults of dreadful troubles.

**Another. Builder of heaven’s vault.**

As mediator of the Old and Forerun­ner of the New, leader of the preach­ing of the Gospel, you reproached the lawless union of a tyrant and glori­ously met your death with joy.

A girl that had come from a lawless womb, filled by drunkenness with Bacchic frenzy, said to Herod, Give me the head of John on a dish, to be­stow on my mother a longed for gift.

The shameless tyrant, unable to endure the reproaches of your God-protected tongue, glorious Forerun­ner, gives your revered head to a girl as a prize for her vulgar dances.

**Theotokion.**

Having dwelt bodily in a Virgin, Lord, you appeared to mortals as it was fitting for them to see you; and you revealed her as true Mother of God and help of believers, only Lover of mankind.

**Katavasia.**

A Rod is accepted as a figure of the mystery; for by its budding it marks out the priest. While for the Church that once was barren the Tree of the Cross has flowered for strength and stead­fastness.

**Kathisma. Tone 1. The soldiers watching.**

Let us believers honour with a pure conscience the Forerunner of Christ, Baptist and Prophet, as glorious her­ald, teacher of repentance and as most true martyr of the Saviour; for when he had rebuked the folly of Herod his head was cut off.

<span style="color:windowtext">Glory. </span>**Tone 4. Joseph was amazed.**

Now the Baptist of the Saviour has appeared and spiritually makes joyful the minds of the faithful; he the adornment of the wilderness and the seal of the Prophets; there he was revealed as Forerunner of Christ and unerring witness of his Coming. So with spiritual songs let us cry out to John with one accord, Prophet, her­ald of the truth, intercede that we may be saved.

<span style="color:windowtext">Both now.</span> **Theotokion.**

All the choirs of Angels were amazed, pure Virgin, at the dread mystery of your child-bearing: how the One who by his will alone upholds the universe is held as a mortal in your arms, and how the pre-eternal accepts a beginning, and the One who nourishes everything that breathes by his ineffable goodness is suckled at the breast. And as they praise you as truly God’s Mother glorify you.

**Ode 4. You, Lord, are my strength.**

Unable to bear the severity of the rebukes and the god-fearing boldness of speech, the one who was liable to the penalties of the law, disfigured by the licentiousness of the pleasures, bound and imprisoned the one who in spirit was joined before the end with the choirs on high.

Afflicted by drunkenness that harms the soul and by licentious passion, the coward, betrayed by the beat of the dancing feet, was revealed to be the murderer of a Prophet; for he conceived drunkenness, mother of intemperance, and gave birth to dread iniquity.

Truly in you the divine voice was not deceived; for you are more than the Prophets, having being deemed worthy of prophecy from the womb while your body was not fully formed and having seen and baptized in the body God the Word, who had been prophesied by you.

**Theotokion.**

You are the boast of the faithful, Virgin without bridegroom, you are the protection and you are the refuge, wall and haven of Christians, for you bring supplications to your Son, All-blameless one, and you save from dangers those who with faith and love know you to be the pure Mother of God.

**Another. From a shaded mountain.**

Herod did not endure your rebukes, O servant of Christ, all-blessed John, and so he prepared unjust murder against you, for he had no reverence for your holiness.

The unjust king, maddened by Bacchic frenzy and drunkenness, made away with you, O Prophet, by an murderous sentence, for he had no reverence for your holiness.

Impious, dread Herod, led on by the words of a girl, gave your head as a gift to the adulteress, O Prophet. From it you pour out grace for us all.

**Theotokion.**

Hail from our lips, holy Mother of God. Hail, who bore joy for the world. Hail, only help of mortals, pure and blessed Mother of God.

**Katavasia.**

Lord, I have heard the mystery of your dispensation; I have<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>considered your works and glorified your Godhead.

**Ode 5. Why have you cast me.**

On her mother’s instructions the cub, more savage than the savage lioness, possessed of an evil spirit, asked as the reward for her dance the head of the Forerunner and herald, which even all the wild beasts in the deserts treated with reverence.

How beyond reach and beyond un­derstanding are your judgements, O Lover of mankind! Because a licen­tious girl danced in triumph over the one who had been revealed from the womb as a vessel of the Spirit and who had advanced in soberness and purity.

It was agreeable and natural to the one who favoured an improper union to link to his birthday drinking bouts the removal of a Prophet and to mix for the pleasure-seekers a full bowl of prophetic and holy blood.

**Theotokion.**

As you gained a mother’s boldness towards your Son, All-pure Virgin, do not despise our kindred care, we beg, for we Christians put you alone forward to the Master as a kindly means of atonement.

**Another. Rising at dawn we cry.**

As payment for a dance the head of the Forerunner on a dish was given through deception to the girl. O folly!

A **** presumptuous adulteress was de­lighted by the gore dripping from your head, O Herald of God. O folly!

Herod compelled your tongue to be silent; but when silenced it rebuked him all the more, All-praised Fore­runner.

**Theotokion.**

We sing your praise as Virgin after child-birth, Mother of God, because for the world you bore in the flesh God the Word.

**Katavasia.**

Thrice-blessed Tree, on which Christ, the King and Lord, was stretched! Through it the one who de­ceived through a tree has fallen, caught by the bait of God who was nailed to you in the flesh and who grants peace to our souls.

**Ode 6. Be merciful to me, Saviour.**

Braving danger for the law of the commandments, blessed one, you disciplined the transgressor by your rebukes, for you were a reed blown about by the breaths of hostile spirits.

The head, dripping with the gore of slaughter, was brought as payment for licentious actions, even after death rebuking Herod as one who befouled nature.

Wandering in deserts, clothed in camel’s hairs, you dwell in the former as in a royal palace, wearing the latter as a kingly robe you reigned over your passions.

**Theotokion.**

May we be delivered from dread failings by your intercessions, pure Mother of God, and may we obtain the divine radiance of the Son of God who was ineffably incarnate from you.

**Another. Grant me a tunic.**

For the multitude of the faithful, glo­rious John, you were a source of di­vine teachings when you announced the Lamb of God to us.

Unerring example of holiness and strict life, O Forerunner, as you stand before Christ remember those who sing your praise.

At your prayers, Prophet, Baptist and Forerunner of Christ, give peace to the world and save our souls from dangers.

**Theotokion.**

You that alone through a word bore the Word in your womb deliver, we pray, our souls from the snares of the foe.

**Katavasia.**

Jonas, stretching out his hands like a cross in the belly of the sea monster, clearly prefigured the saving Passion. Escaping from there on the third day, he was an image of the transcendent Resurrection of Christ God, who was nailed in the flesh and by his rising on the third day enlightened the world.

**Kontakion. Tone 5.**

The glorious beheading of the Fore­runner became a divine dispensation, that he might proclaim to those in Hell the coming of the Saviour. So let Herodias grieve who asked for lawless murder, for she loved neither the law of God nor the age that lives, but one **artificial and temporary**.

**Ikos**

The birthday feast of Herod appeared to all as unholy, for among the revellers the head of the faster was brought in like food. Grief was joined to joy and bitter lament was mingled with the laughter because the young woman entered among them bearing the head of the Baptist on a dish, as it says, and through mad passion grief fell on all who were then feasting with the king, for she delighted nei­ther them nor Herod, it says, and they were grieved, not with true grief but with **artificial and temporary**.

**Synaxarion**

On the 29th of the month, com­memoration of the beheading of the honoured head of the holy, glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist John.

**Verses
A murderous hand with sword cuts off the head**
Of him who on the Lord’s head placed his hand.
Bronze on the twenty ninth day with a blow smote the neck of the Baptist.

On the same day, commemoration of the venerable Theodora of Thessaloniki, who came from Aegina.

At the prayers of your Forerunner, O Christ, have mercy and save us. <span lang="FR" style="mso-ansi-language:FR">Amen.</span>

<span lang="FR" style="mso-ansi-language:FR">**Ode 7. God’s condescension.**</span>

Lawless Herod, armed with licentious lust and terrible drunkenness you as­saulted and tore down the unshakeable tower of self-mastery, the invincible city of sobriety, the Baptist of Christ.

She that had been made a disciple of the devil did not tremble, O Forerun­ner, did not draw back, did not hesi­tate as she shamelessly brought forward your precious head on a dish, for she was bolted fast to constraints of her mother.

As a lamp you shone out beforehand, as an Angel you were sent ahead, as a Prophet you proclaim as lamb of God Christ who has appeared, as a martyr your head was cut off by a sword, and you announced Christ in advance to the dead in Hell.

**Theotokion.**

Delivered by your Offspring from the condemnation of the ancient fall, we ever glorify you, Virgin Mother, who were revealed as cause of freedom with your Son who gave himself as a ransom for us.

**Another. The Hebrew Youths.**

Servant heralding the Master’s Com­ing, morning star heralding the sun, John hastened to Hades crying, Blessed are you, Lord God, to the ages.

O folly of Herod! He gives to a dissolute woman as a plaything the one who with an immaterial body was equal to the Angels and who cried, Blessed are you, O God, to the ages.

Accept, O Holy of Holies, as I inter­cede for the Church, cries out the Forerunner to the Master and cries, Blessed are you, Lord God, to the ages.

**Theotokion.**

You stemmed the onrush of death, pure Virgin, when you conceived and gave birth to immortal God, to whom we all sing, Blessed are you, Lord God, to the ages.

**Katavasia.**

The senseless decree of a godless tyrant, redolent of threats and blasphemies hateful to God, drove peoples to confusion. But neither the fury of wild beasts nor the roaring of the fire frightened three Youths; but united in the fire that answered with a spirit bringing dew they sang, ‘O our God and the God of our Fathers, O highly exalted, blessed are you!’

**Ode 8. The Chaldean Tyrant.**

John, who outran your birth and your passion, came through a sword to the lowest parts of the earth as Prophet and Messenger of your entrance also there, crying as voice of the Word, You dead, highly exalt the Giver of life, you blind, the Giver of light, you prisoners, the Deliverer Christ.

You outran a virgin birth by your birth from a barren mother and now you have become the precursor of the voluntary crucifixion of the creator of the universe by the cutting off of your head, as you cry to those in Hades, You dead, highly exalt the Giver of life, you blind, the Giver of light, you prisoners, the Deliverer Christ.

When your head was smitten from your body, O Forerunner, your soul that ruled it was parted from your flesh; but the Godhead was not parted from the flesh of Emmanuel, not a bone was broken of the God and Master. And so we highly exalt him to the ages.

**Theotokion.**

Sovereign Lady, Mother of the Lord, by your compassionate intercession wipe out the wounds and bruises of my soul and raise me who am fallen. Save me the prodigal, O All-blame­less, save me. For you are my protection and only assistance, pure and blessed to all the ages.

**Another. Same Irmos.**

Once the boastful tyrant Herod transgressed and having turned his attention to the festivities of his birthday he arranges for the young woman to dance, having convinced her that he will fulfil her every re­quest. But she, compelled by her mother’s instructions, asked for the head of the Forerunner on a dish.

Having gained for himself the charge of foul murder the wretched king Herod earns himself inescapable pun­ishment, by transgressing outrageously. For he brings to the table like food the head of the Forerunner, which rebukes him together with Herodias to all the ages.

Blessed John, shining Apostle and Forerunner of the Lord, chosen of the Prophets, by your entreaties save those who celebrate with love your radiant and light-bearing memory as they cry out, O Youths bless, O Priests praise, O people highly exalt Christ to the ages.

**Theotokion.**

You have become holier than the An­gels, All-holy Maiden, for you bore the One who is Holy for the Holy, who through pity became without what we mortals are to save those who cry out to him without ceasing, O Youths bless, O Priests praise, O people highly exalt Christ to the ages.

**Katavasia.**

O Youths, equal in number to the Trinity, bless the Creator, Father, God; sing the praises of the Word who descended and changed the fire to dew, and highly exalt the all-holy Spirit that grants life to all, to the ages.

**Ode 9. All that hears trembled.**

Every regiment of evil trembled together with their champion the devil at your theologian’s tongue, O Prophet, which proclaims Christ, and through a dissolute girl they persuaded Herod to cut off your head. But we, the faithful, magnify you.

A valley, humble nature, has been exalted and a hill, the arrogance of death, has been humbled, for the voice of one who cries cried aloud in the deserts without light, the tents of Hades, Lift up the gates, for the mighty King will enter.

The passions of mortals tremble and demons flee in terror at the over­shadowing of the grace that was given you from God. But guard from both trials, O Forerunner of the Lord, your flock which ever magnifies you with faith.

**Theotokion.**

Bend your bow, march forward and reign, O Son of God’s Mother, subduing the Ishmaelite people that wars against us, granting victories to our Orthodox Sovereign over barbarian enemies at the prayers of the one who gave you birth, O Word of God.

**Another. Heaven was amazed.**

You were a voice of one who cries, O Baptist, for you shone forth as a Prophet from a Prophet crying out in the desert to all, Repent; and you rebuked Herod who did evil, licentious deeds, And so you hurried on to Hades proclaiming the Kingdom of our God.

A shameless girl, forced by her mother Herodias, asked that the sa­cred head of the Baptist be cut off. Then Herod with speed gives orders that it be laid out like food on a dish and given as a gift, which folly it rebukes.

As Martyr and Prophet and Baptist, as voice and lamp and Messenger, witnessed to by God as greater than the Prophets, entreat the Lord to deliver from trials of every kind and from hostile harm those who cele­brate your light-bearing memory, O Forerunner.

**Theotokion.**

You were seen, O Virgin Mother of God, to give birth beyond nature in a body to the good Word that the Father uttered from his own heart before all the ages as he is good. Him we know also to be beyond bodies, even though he has been clothed in a body.

**Katavasias.**

Mystic Paradise are you, O Mother of God, untilled you brought forth Christ, who planted on the earth the life-giving Tree of the Cross. And so as it is raised today, we worship it and magnify you.

The death that came to the race through eating of the tree has, through the Cross, today been made of no effect. For the curse on all mankind of our mother Eve has been abolished by the shoot of the pure Mother of God, whom all the Powers of heaven mag­nify.

**Exapostilarion. Tone 2. As the Disciples.**

Let us garland with hymns of praise the one known to be greatest among Prophets and who became precursor of Apostles, the Forerunner of grace, for his head was cut off for the sake of the law of the Lord.

**Another. The heaven with stars.**

Dissolute Herod treacherously cut off your head, planter of purity, Baptist of the Saviour, but was quite unable to cut out the rebukes of your tongue.

**Theotokion.**

Holy Maiden, who abolished by your divine childbearing the curse of the world, deliver by your prayers from dangers of every kind the flock that faithfully entreats you.

**At Lauds we insert 4 Stichera and we sing three Prosomia,
doubling the first.
Tone 8. O marvellous wonder!**

O marvellous wonder! A dissolute, licentious girl carries round the sacred head revered by Angels. She offers to her adulterous mother the tongue that rebuked the lawless. O your ineffable forbearance, lover of mankind! Through it, O Christ, save our souls, for you alone are compas­sionate.

O the blindness of Herod! Having dishonoured God by neglect of the law he treacherously promises to keep his oaths. And he adds murder to adultery, pretending to be sad. O your ineffable compassion, lover of mankind! Through it, O Christ, save our souls, for you alone are compas­sionate.

O amazement beyond understanding! The seal of the Prophets, the earthly Angel is displayed as the reward of a harlot’s dance. The tongue that spoke of God is sent on before and is the herald of Christ to those in Hades. O your forethought beyond speech, lover of mankind! Through it, O Christ, save our souls, for you alone are compassionate.

<span style="color:windowtext">Glory.</span> **Tone 6.**

Once again Herodias rages, once again she is deranged. O deceitful dance and revelry with deceit! The Baptist was beheaded and Herod was troubled. At the prayers of your Forerunner, Lord, grant peace to our souls.

<span style="color:windowtext">Both now.</span> **Theotokion.**

Mother of God, you are the true vine, who gave bud to the fruit of life; we implore you, Sovereign Lady, intercede together with the Apostles and all the Saints that he have mercy on our souls.

**Great Doxology.**

<span style="color:red">And holy oil is given to the Brethren.</span>
