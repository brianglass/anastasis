For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his, we shall also be united with him in the resurrection. For we know that our old self was crucified with him, so that our sinful body might be done away with, that we might no longer be in slavery to sin. For one who has died has been justified from sin. If then we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. For we know that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more; death no longer lords it over him. As to dying, he died once and for all; as to living, he lives for God. Consequently, you also must consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span>

Why do you spend money on what is not food, and toil for what does not satisfy? Hear me, and eat what is good, and your soul will delight in good things. Give heed with your ears and follow in my ways. Listen to me and your soul will live among good things. And I will make an eternal Covenant with you, the sure mercies of David. See, I have given him as a testimony among the Nations, a ruler and commander among the Nations. See, Nations who do not know you will call upon you, and peoples who are not acquainted with you will take refuge with you, for the sake of the Lord your God and the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified you. Seek the Lord, and when you find him, call upon him. But when he comes near you, let the impious abandon his ways and a lawless man his plans. And return to the Lord and you will find mercy, and cry out, for he will abundantly forgive your sins. For my plans are not like your plans, nor are my ways like your ways, says the Lord. But as far as heaven is from earth, so far is my way from your ways and your thoughts from my mind. For as rain or snow comes down from heaven and does not return until it has saturated the earth and it brings forth and sprouts and gives seed to the sower and bread for food, so will my word be. Whatever comes out of my mouth will not return to me empty, until everything that I wished has been fulfilled. And I will make my ways and my commands prosper. You will go out with gladness and be taught with joy. For the mountains and hills will leap up, welcoming you with joy, and all the trees of the field will clap with their branches. And instead of brambles cypress will come up, and instead of nettles myrtle will come up. And there shall be for the Lord a name and an everlasting sign, and it will not fail.</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">When a just man is praised, peoples will be glad; for immortality is his memory, because it is known both to God and humankind, and his soul is pleasing to the Lord. Therefore, O men<a href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28">[28]</a>, desire wisdom, and long for it and be instructed. For her beginning is love and keeping of laws. Honour Wisdom, that you may reign for ever. I will declare the mysteries of God to you and not hide them from you. Because he is both the guide of Wisdom and the One who sets right the wise. In his hand are all prudence, and knowledge of works. Wisdom, the artificer of all things, taught me, for in her is an understanding spirit, holy, brightness of the eternal light and image of the goodness of God. She makes friends of God and prophets. She is more lovely than the sun, and beyond every order of the stars. If compared to light, she is found before it. She delivered her devotees from toils, and guided them in straight paths. She gave them holy knowledge and protected them from those who lay in ambush for them. She awarded them a mighty contest, that all might know that true religion is more powerful than all, and that wickedness can never prevail against Wisdom, nor will justice in passing sentence overlook evil people. For they said in themselves, not reasoning correctly, ‘Let us overpower the just one, let us not spare his saintliness, nor feel reverence for the aged grey hairs of an elder. Let our strength be law. Let us lie in ambush for the just, for he is a hindrance to us and he is opposed to our works and alleges the sins of our upbringing. He claims to have knowledge of God, and calls himself a child of the Lord. He has become a reproof to our thoughts. He is grievous for us even to look at, for his life is not like others and his paths are quite different. We are reckoned by him to be counterfeit, and he keeps away from our ways as from filth. He calls the end of just people blessed. Let us see if his words are true, and let us test what will happen to him at the end. Let us examine him by insult and torture, that we may know his forbearance and make trial of his patience. Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for he will have protection from his own words.’ This was how they argued, and they were deceived, for their wickedness had blinded them. And they did not know the mysteries of God, nor did they judge that you alone are God, who have authority over life and death, who save in time of tribulation and deliver from every ill; pitying and merciful, giving grace to your holy ones, and by your right arm resisting the proud.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">[1]</a><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">\ </span></sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;">The text of the Menaion is more complex than some lists reveal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In particular, verse 3 is displaced to follow v.7 and the clause ‘and he worshipped the Lord’ is added.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This difference is not noted by Wevers in his apparatus to the Göttingen edition.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref2" id="_ftn2">[2]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> Literally ‘before the age’, but this sounds very odd in English. However, it underlines the fact that the Greek *aion* is a ‘time’ word, rather than a ‘place’ one.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref3" id="_ftn3">[3]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> The first part of this sentence is only found in the Alexandrinus and the reviser of the Sinaiticus. It is from the Hebrew and marked by Origen with the \*. The precise meaning of the Hebrew is unclear, and so is the Greek. The translation given above is plausible, but not necessarily correct.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref4" id="_ftn4">[4]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> This elaborate reading is taken from Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and lastly Wisdom, hence the title. The opening part of the text speaks both of ‘a man’ — *aner* not *anthropos* — and ‘\[the\] wise’, or ‘\[the\] just’, in the plural.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref5" id="_ftn5">[5]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> Cf. Psalm 118,1.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref6" id="_ftn6">[6]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> Since Wisdom is personified in these texts, the feminine has been retained in the translation, without prejudice, as the lawyers say.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref7" id="_ftn7">[7]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> The four natural, or ‘cardinal’ virtues.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref8" id="_ftn8">[8]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> Unusually this Prokeimenon is taken from two different Psalms. The prokeimenon is taken from the last half of Psalm 28:3, with a repunctuation of the Greek. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref9" id="_ftn9">[9]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> This phrase presents considerable problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It does not occur in the critical texts, which simply have ‘habitations of reed’. It does, however, occur in 34:13.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is unclear why the pious baronet, Sir Lancelot C. L. Brenton, renders it ‘ready habitations’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Does he mean ‘reedy habitations’?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The word I have rendered ‘owls’ is in Greek ‘sirens’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 34 the context is negative, ‘Thorns shall grow up in their cities. … They shall be habitations of *sirens* — which the pious baronet translates, both here and elsewhere, by ‘monsters’ —, and a court of ostriches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And demons will meet with *onokentauroi* \[which means in classical Greek ‘tailless apes’!\].’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here, though, the meaning should be positive.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The coupling of ‘sirens’ and ‘ostriches’ also occurs at Job 30:29, again in a negative context. ‘I have gone groaning without being muzzled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I stood crying out in the assembly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have become brother of sirens and companion of ostriches’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On this passage St John Chrysostom says, ‘By sirens he means some form of bird that sings, like kingfishers or owls, both of which have mournful songs’. Hence I tentatively put ‘owls’ here, though perhaps the translator was thinking of the mythical Sirens, whose song was so alluring that it led mariners to their doom. A possible translation might be ‘songbirds’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span>

<a href="#_ftnref10" id="_ftn10">[10]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> See the note on the Prokeimenon of the First Hour.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref11" id="_ftn11">[11]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> A considerable problem for the translator, which I discussed at some length in a review in *Sourozh*. The Fathers themselves are not agreed, St Basil opting for ‘Spirit’, St Ephrem for ‘wind’. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref12" id="_ftn12">[12]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> Neither Greek nor English can reproduce the play on the meaning of *mara*.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref13" id="_ftn13">[13]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> Both the Hebrew and the Greek have singular pronouns in these verses, though the reference must be to Israel, rather than Moses only. English versions, including AV, NRSV and NAB, make this explicit by putting ‘them’ here.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref14" id="_ftn14">[14]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> This clause is not in the Hebrew, nor in the uncials A and B. Rahlfs reads not *dierthi*, but *diesti*. There are a number of other small differences, but they do affect the translation.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref15" id="_ftn15">[15]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> The LXX has here either *aphpho* or *appho*, both of which are odd, being simply near transliterations of the Hebrew, which means something like ‘Yea, he’, ‘Even he’. St Jerome has ‘nunc etiam’, which makes sense, but is somewhat free.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref16" id="_ftn16">[16]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> Although the Greek here, as in a number of other places, has *anthropos*, I retain the translation ‘man’, since the passage is used liturgically for a male. This does not create problems, since, so far as I am aware, no female saints have readings at Vespers. Where the word is plural ‘inclusive’ words are preferred.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref17" id="_ftn17">[17]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> A reference to Enoch \[Gen. 5,21-24\], who was a mere stripling of three hundred and sixty five by patriarchal standards when God took him. </span>

<a href="#_ftnref18" id="_ftn18">[18]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> This sentence contains no main verb in Greek, the first three verbs being aorist participles.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref19" id="_ftn19">[19]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> Both the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lxx</span> and the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">mt</span> have the first person in this verse. The lectionary, like a few minuscules, has the third.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref20" id="_ftn20">[20]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> The Greek is ‘proselyte’, but the word in the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lxx</span> simply means someone who ‘comes to one’ from elsewhere. The French translate by ‘immigrant’, which is accurate, but gives the wrong connotation in English.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref21" id="_ftn21">[21]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> Literally ‘the heaven of heaven’, but this, with the singular, sounds odd in English.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref22" id="_ftn22">[22]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">lxx</span> has the singular here, referring to the earth.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref23" id="_ftn23">[23]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> *La Bible d*‘*Alexandrie* takes *met’autous ymas* together, ‘after you’, but this is surely wrong.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref24" id="_ftn24">[24]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> See the note on this word in Reading 28.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref25" id="_ftn25">[25]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> I give no list of verses, since this is a most complicated selection of verses and half verses, and the numbering of the Greek and Hebrew differs.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref26" id="_ftn26">[26]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> See the note on Reading 6.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref27" id="_ftn27">[27]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> This is the punctuation of the lectionary. The natural way is to take ‘knowledge and understanding’ as objects of ‘call on’.</span>

<a href="#_ftnref28" id="_ftn28">[28]</a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;"> The Greek here has *andres*, not *anthropoi.*</span>
