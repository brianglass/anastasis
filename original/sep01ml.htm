<p>Note that the Church of God celebrates the Indiction, having received the tradition
from the ancients, for it was thought by the Romans that this Indiction marked the
beginning of the year (the word Indiction means for the Romans &#145;boundary&#146;).
Moreover because on this day Our Lord Jesus Christ entered the Synagogue of the Jews and
being handed a book (it was that of the Prophet Isaias), He opened it and found the
passage where it is written: &#145;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, therefore He has
anointed me; He has sent me to preach the gospel to the poor; to heal the broken hearted;
to proclaim forgiveness for prisoners, and sight to the blind; to proclaim an acceptable
year of the Lord&#146; [Is.61,1-2]. Then he handed the book to the attendant, sat down and
said: &#145;To-day this Scripture has been fulfilled in your ears&#146;. When too the
crowds marvelled at the words of grace that came from his mouth [Lk. 4,16-22]</font><font FACE="ClassGarmnd BT" SIZE="1">.</font></p>

<p>This Jesus was the son of Navi and successor of Moses as lawgiver for the Hebrews. He
captured Jericho, a city of foreigners and saw the Chief Captain Michael holding a sword.
On learning that he was the Chief Captain of the Power of the Lord, he threw away his arms
and fell at his feet. Once when fighting a battle against foreigners the sun was about to
set, so in his zeal for battle he prayed to God and said: &#145;Let the sun stand
still&#146;; and at once the sun stopped in its course and did not set until he had
mightily routed the foreigners. He was commander of the people and led them from the
wilderness and apportioned to them the land of Promise, which is Palestine. He judged the
people of Israel for twenty seven years, became the dread of his enemies and, having
displayed his courage and virtue in many wars, died and was buried with honour by his own

Christ, having as their teacher the Deacon Ammoun. Arrested by Vavdos the Governor of
Adrianoupolis and fiercely tortured for not worshipping the idols they prayed to God, and
the priest of the idols was suspended in mid-air, was punished for many hours then fell
and perished. Saint Ammoun was strung up and his sides were burned; then a red-hot helmet
was placed on his head. Delivered from this, he was sent with the holy Virgins from Verroi
to Heraklion in Thrace, to the tyrant Licinius; and by the latter&#146;s decision ten of

him; if we deny him, he in turn will deny us; if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful:
he cannot deny himself. Remind people of these things, warning them before the Lord not to
wrangle over words, which serves no useful purpose, but ruins those who listen. Be eager
to take your stand before God as one well tested, a worker who is unashamed, who rightly
proclaims the word of truth. Avoid profane and idle talk; for it only makes people advance
in impiety, and their word will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaios and
Philetos, who have swerved from the truth by saying that the resurrection has already
taken place. They are upsetting the faith of some. But God&#146;s firm foundation stands
and carries this inscription, &#145;The Lord knows those who are his&#146; and &#145;Let
everyone who calls on the name of the Lord turn away from wickedness.&#146;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">NOTE ON THE TYPIKON</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The present Menaion gives a Polyeleos and Gospel for Matins, but this is modern, and
the texts used as Kathisma and Idiomel are used elsewhere in the office. The Typikon of
Dionysiou makes no mention of this addition, nor, in fact, does the Typikon printed in the
Menaion. This section has therefore been printed within square brackets. There are also
some differences over the Apostle and Gospel for the Saint. The Menaion prescribes for the
Liturgy the Gospel for Matins of St Efthymios, not that for the Liturgy, which is Luke
6:17-21. These two Gospels are in fact interchangeable between Matins and Liturgy. See,
for example December 4th , St Savvas.</p>

<p>In the following notes the parts in square brackets are taken from the Typikon of
Dionysiou and represent the fuller, monastic, use.</p>

<p>If the 1st of September falls on a Sunday, the Typikon is as follows. [The off ice of
the Holy Women is omitted, or read at Compline.]</p>

<p>On Saturday evening the whole of the 1st Kathisma of the Psalter is said, even if the
1st Section is sung. At Lord, I have cried 4 Stichera of the Resurrection in the Tone of
the week, 3 of the Indiction and the 3 Prosomia of the Saint. Glory of the Indiction, Tone
6, One with the Holy Spirit and Both now the 1st Theotokion of the Tone. Entrance, O
joyful light, prokeimenon of the day and the Readings. At the Aposticha, the Stichera and
verses from the Oktoichos, Glory of the Saint Venerable Father, and Both now of the
Indiction You, O King. Apolytikia of the Resurrection, of the Indiction and of the Mother
of God Hail, full of grace. [Or Resurrection, Saint and Indiction.] And Dismissal.</p>

<p>At Matins, at The Lord is God, Apolytkia as at Vespers, except that the Resurrection
one is sung twice. The Resurrection Kathismata and that of the Indiction O God who grant
fruitful seasons twice. [That is, it replaces the Theotokion each time.] After Psalm 118,
the Evlogitaria, the Ypako, the Anavathmi of the Tone and the Prokeimenon. The Canons,
of the Resurrection and of the Indiction. [Or, more correctly, that of the Resurrection
and the Mother of God to 6. That is, the Irmos and Troparia of the Resurrection (=4) and 2
Troparia from the canon to the Mother of God (= 6). Of the Indiction (4) and of the Saint
(4), making 14.] The Katavasias of the Cross. After the 3rd Ode, Kontakion and Ikos of the
Resurrection and the final Kathisma of the Indiction As Master of the universe. [Or,
Kontakion and Ikos of the Resurrection, Glory Kathisma of the Saint, Both now Kathisma of
the Indiction As Master of the universe.] After the 6th Ode, Kontakion and Ikos of the
Indiction, [Or, Kontakion and Ikos of the Saint] the Synaxarion of the day. The Magnificat
is sung. Exapostilaria of the Resurrection, the Saint and the Indiction .At Lauds, 4
Stichera of the Resurrection and 4 of the Indiction (doubling the first), Glory of the
Indiction O Word, Christ God and the usual Sunday Theotokion. [Or, 4 Stichera of the
Resurrection, 3 of the Indiction and the Doxastikon of the Saint, with the appropriate
verses, A hymn is due to you, O God in Sion (see the Aposticha of Vespers) and Precious in
the sight of the Lord is the death of holy one, Glory the Eothinon of the Sunday and the
usual Sunday Theotokion. Great Doxology and the usual Resurrection Troparion. First Hour
[and Catechesis of St Theodore].</p>

<p>At the Hours the Resurrection Apolytikion is read at each, but that of the Indiction
and Saint are read alternately. The Ypako and Kontakion of the Saint are both read.</p>

<p>At the Liturgy, Typika and Beatitudes, with of which 4 Troparia of the Resurrection in
the Tone of the week, and 4 from Ode 6 of the Indiction [Or, and 4 from Ode 3 of the canon
of the Indiction and 4 from Ode 6 of the canon of the Saint, making 12] After the
Entrance, Apolytikia of the Resurrection, the Indiction, the Mother of God, the Saint and
the Church.. Kontakion of the Indiction [Or, of the Resurrection, the Indiction, the
Saint, the Church and the Mother of God.] Apostle, Gospel and Communion of the Indiction
[Or, of the Indiction and the Saint. Those of the Sunday are omitted.]</p>

<p>[After the Prayer behind the Ambo at once the Apolytiokion and Kontakion of the Saints
are sung with the one to the Mother of God. After the blessing of the Kollyva the Priest
enters the sanctuary, while we begin Psalm 142 and the usual Lesser Blessing of water for
the 1st of the month is sung.]</font>
