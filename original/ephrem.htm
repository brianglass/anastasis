WRITINGS<br>
EXTANT ONLY IN GREEK</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Book Antiqua">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The ascetic writings in Greek attributed to St
Ephrem the Syrian [&#134; 373] are some of the basic texts of Orthodox monasticism. The <i>Triodion
</i>lays down that they are to be read at Matins each weekday morning in Lent, after the
first two readings from the Psalter. Together with the <i>Lausiac History</i> of
Palladios, prescribed to be read after the third reading of the Psalter and the third Ode
of the Canon, the <i>Ladder</i> of St John of Sinai and the <i>Instructions</i> of St
Theodore the Studite, they should form the regular diet of non-biblical spiritual reading
for Orthodox Christians.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The large corpus of Greek texts that go under the
name of St Ephrem the Syrian have been greatly neglected by scholars. The only full
editions are those published in the 18th century by Thwaites, in Oxford [1709], and by
Assemani, largely based on Thwaites, in Rome [1743]. Mercati began a critical edition in
1915, but only one fascicle of the first volume ever appeared. In 1988 a corrected
reprint, based on the two eighteenth century editions, together with a translation into
Modern Greek, began to be published in Thessaloniki. It was brought to completion late in
1998 with the publication of the seventh, and final, volume.&nbsp; This final volume
contains a number of texts that do appear in either of the 18th century editions.The whole
is extremely useful, though it is not a critical, but rather a practical, edition.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Some of these texts seem to be translations of
Syriac metrical homilies, but the majority of them are almost certainly original Greek
works and most of these the product of Byzantine coenobitic monasticism. They are of
different dates and by different authors. A number of them are written in the metre called
in Syriac the &#145;metre of St Ephrem&#146;, but do not appear to be translations. Some
of them seem to have been known to St Romanos the Melodist in the sixth century and one
large collection of fifty &#145;Exhortations to the Monks of Egypt&#146; is mentioned by
St Photios the Great [c.810-c.895] in his &#145;Library&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The best known of these Greek texts is the prayer of
St Ephrem the Syrian, which is prescribed for use in all the Lenten offices of the Church
and is one of best loved prayers of Orthodox Christians. The vices there listed are those
typical of coenobitic communities, which leads one to suggest that the prayer is unlikely
to be by St Ephrem himself, though whether its origin is Greek or Syrian is harder to say.
There is one intriguing difference between the Greek and Slavonic texts of the prayer.
Where the Greek has &#145;idle curiosity&#146;, <i>periergia</i>, the Slavonic has
&#145;faint-heartedness&#146;, which in Greek is<i> akedia</i>, the classic monastic sin.
Does this go back to a different original, or is it a reflection of differing national
temperaments?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">These Greek writings attributed to St Ephrem have
never been translated into English and so I hope on this page to begin to fill a yawning
gap in the spiritual reading of English speaking Orthodox Christians. The translations are
not &#145;scholarly&#146;, since no critical edition of the originals exists, but
&#145;practical&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The icon of St Ephrem was painted for me at the
Monastery of the Holy Paraclete, Oropos, Attica in Greece in 1982.</font></p>
