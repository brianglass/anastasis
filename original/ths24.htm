<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5" color="#FF0000">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">As the opening
quotation from the Gospel of the day makes clear, this Instruction was intended for the
first day of the new ecclesiastical year, the beginning of the Indiction on 1 September.
The beginning of the second paragraph contains a quotation from the Anaphora of St John
Chrysostom.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="6" face="Book Antiqua">CATECHESIS 24</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Of the surpassing
gift of God, of love for him and hatred of the devil, and of humility. It was spoken at
the beginning of the year.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Brethren and fathers, the beginning of the year has
already come, on which the Good Tidings are read in these words,<i>The Spirit of the Lord
is upon me, because he has anointed me, he has sent me to bring good tidings to the poor,
to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim forgiveness to captives and sight to the blind, to
send the oppressed away with forgiveness, to announce a year acceptable to the Lord</i>
[Luke 4:18-19, Isa. 61:1-2, 58:6]. Since then the only-begotten Son of God has been sent
from the Father as propitiation for the world, may we, the blind, see again, we captives
be freed, we oppressed be forgiven. Who is blind? One short-sighted through attachment to
the passions. Who is captive? One led away by unseemly thoughts. Who is oppressed? One
broken by sins. The Lord heals them; for he is a physician of souls as well as bodies. And
he was not only present in bodily form to those at that time, but he is also present now,
invisibly, with the same good tidings, <i>taking away the sin of the world, and healing
every disease and every weakness</i> [John 1:29, Matt. 9:35]. Let no one then remain
unenlightened and unhealed, but let them draw near with faith and <i>they will receive
blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God their Saviour</i> [Ps. 23:5].</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Oh, what ineffable love for humankind! He brought us
from non-existence into existence; when we had fallen, he raised us up again; he has
granted us a third grace: monastic completeness; and though we are still sinning, he does
not therefore turn away, but he draws near and consoles us when we are afflicted,
encourages us when we are sorrowing, massages us when we are running, strengthens us when
enfeebled and heals us when wounded; and when we are about to fall into pit of Hell
itself, he goes ahead and snatches us from dangers in his love for humankind; so that it
would be appropriate for each of us to say, <i>If the Lord had not helped me, my soul had
almost dwelt in Hell</i> [Ps.93:17]. And <i>I was thrust down and overthrown so as to
fall, and the Lord came to my assistance</i> [Ps. 117:13]. And each one knows the
temptations into which they have fallen, and how they have at once found the good God to
be their helper in their afflictions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">In addition he who is supremely good nourishes us
when we hunger, with regard to our bodies with the fruits that the earth bears year by
year; with regard to the soul with the most pure Mysteries, as he longs for us more than a
mother or a nurse and embraces us with affection. For a mother nourishes her child with
milk for a time, while he our true master and father gives his own body and blood as food
and drink, and this permanently. Oh, what unfathomable goodness! And oh, what an
incomparable gift! How then can we fail to love him? How fail to cherish him? How fail to
cling to him unceasingly? So that if we were not so disposed, heaven would instantly cry
out against us, earth would groan, the very stones would condemn our utter insensibility.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">So that this may not happen, let us hold fast to
love of him, hating and rightly turning away from the devil. For as our benefactor is
loved and cherished in proportion to his benefactions, so the wicked one should be hated
and rejected for his ways in equal proportion. For he is the destroyer of our life. In the
words of the Master, <i>he is a murderer from the beginning </i>[John 8:44]. He is the one
who has divided our race into ten thousand opinions, wounding it with many darts of sin
and seeking to swallow down the inhabited world. If we do not hate him, there will be no
escaping the punishment that will be meted out to us, because we joined to our foe and
murderer. But, my brothers, let us fly from him! Let us fly most certainly. What is
flight? The avoidance of wicked actions and thoughts, and also affinity with God, the
assumption of good works.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">And so let us chose the good with all humility and
meekness and modesty serving the Lord, knowing that every achievement that is not guarded
by humility is worthless. So let those of us whose ideas are puffed up humble ourselves <i>beneath
the mighty hand of God</i> [1 Peter 5:6], lest we run in vain; but let all of us, doing
well, press forward, pursue, run on, that we may attain, that we may inherit the kingdom
of heaven, in Christ Jesus, our Lord, to whom be glory and might, with the Father and the
Holy Spirit, now and ever and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font>&nbsp;
