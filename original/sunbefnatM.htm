<p>To you in fear the gates of death stand open and the everlasting bars are shattered;
for at your revered descent the dead of old have risen up and with joy, O Christ, they
sing your Resurrection.</p>

<p>Today the company of the godly Fathers radiantly feasts in anticipation Christ&#146;s
Nativity and traces the wonder of this grace: for Abraham and the Youths are a symbol of
the Law.</p>

<p>Of old holy Abraham entertained the one Godhead in three persons; while now the Word,
enthroned with the Father and the divine Spirit, comes forth for the Youths, and he is
greatly praised.</p>

<p>Abraham was delivered from an unjust hand, the godly Youths from the flame of the
furnace and the Prophet Daniel from the wild beats and the den. And so they now feast in
anticipation Christ&#146;s Nativity.</p>

<p>In number and faith of the divine Trinity the Youths in the furnace overthrew
godlessness and in symbols revealed beforehand to the world the mysteries of God that were

<p>Thinking on the glory in the image and likeness of God, the Youths, by the fire of the

know no Lord but you.</p>

<p>With superiority of wisdom and the power of the Spirit the Youths took prisoner and put
to shame the wise men of Babylon, and resolutely they cried out: None is Holy but you, O
Lord, lover of mankind!</p>

<p>The Law rejoices and dances with the Youths and the Prophets, and leaps with joy today

Christ from a Virgin, and he advances to meet his divine Nativity.</p>

<p>Abraham&#146;s Children, clearly foreshadowing the Lord&#146;s coming to us, through
the presence of an Angel quenched the furnace and made the fire a fine mist of dew, and
