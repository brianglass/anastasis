<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">This letter, Book 1,42 [PG 1061-1063], which might
perhaps be entitled &#145;How to Pray&#146;, appears to be addressed to a widow, possibly
a wealthy one, who has adopted a monastic way of life, though &#145;nun&#146; is perhaps
rather too formal as a translation of the Greek &#145;monazousa&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">I thought that my blessed mother had died; but, it
seems, she is still on earth. For what more could she have done than you in showing me a
mother&#146;s care? But though I am a sinner, I trust in the Lord that he will repay you
with no ordinary grace for what you have done for my unworthiness and grant you the
attainment of what you long and ask for. But enough of what has been done. For I dealt
with all that in my previous letter. But you, on the other hand, have increased rather
than exhausted your generosity. And so how could we not now remember your piety. With
clothes, a sacred offering, food and drink you have astounded us from every side. So now
put an stop to your gifts, and be confident of your reward from God. For he was no liar
who said that he rewards even a cup of cold water. [Cf. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Matthew 10,42</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>You say you are grieved by your concern for your child, which leaves you no leisure for
the necessary care for the soul. But God is perfectly well able to look after the affairs
of the good child and to let you have leisure in all things to occupy yourself with what
is profitable for the soul, so as to dispose you with a ready heart for your departure
from the body. You are not able, because of the sickly condition of your body, to fast and
afflict yourself harshly. Bear this without grieving, bringing what you can to the Lord
and filling up what you lack in ascetic practices by an abundance of humility.</p>

<p>You ask to be taught how you ought to pray. The Lord himself taught us this through the
invocation &#145;Our Father&#146;, and that we should not ask for anything temporary, but
for his kingdom and eternal justice. Moreover it has been ordained by the Fathers that
first should come thanksgiving to God; next confession of our sins to him; and so a
request for their forgiveness, and intercession for the other things that bring salvation.</p>

<p>So, when you are about to pray, give thanks to the Lord and Master that he brought you
out of nothing into existence; that he redeemed you from every error, calling you and
counting you worthy to become a partaker in the knowledge of himself, free from pagan,
free from heretical error. Next that he prepared you for the monastic life, which equals
that of the Angels, after the enjoyment of life in the world. The thought of all this is
enough to soften the soul to compunction and the outpouring of tears. From all this comes
enlightenment of heart, sweetness of spirit, desire for God. When this is present in the
heart, there comes the rejection of every evil. When you have thus given thanks to God,
confess to him like this, &#145;You know, Master, how many sins I have committed against
you, and how many I commit each hour&#146;, as you reckon up this sin and this offence and
the ones committed in knowledge and in ignorance. But do not recall in any detail the ones
that by being clearly remembered harm the soul. [Cf. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">The Ladder</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>28,58]
And from this the grace of humility will dawn for you, with a broken heart [Cf. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Psalm 50,18</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">] and fear of God&#146;s recompense. After this, ask, groan, implore your Lord
for forgiveness of these sins and strengthening for the future to please him, saying,
&#145;My Lord, Lord, may I no longer anger you, may I no longer love anything but you,
alone truly to be loved. And should I anger you again, falling down I implore your
compassion, that I may be given strength from now on to please you.&#146; And if anything
else comes to your mind that is good to be accomplished, ask for it fervently. And after
this call upon the holy Mother of God to have mercy on you, the holy Angels, and the Angel
you have as the guardian of your life, that he may watch over you and protect you, the
Forerunner and the holy Apostles, all the Saints and those whom you usually call on
especially, and the one whose memory is kept that day. These then are the things, it seems
to me, which hold the power of prayer, even if each person doubtless prays with other
words and not the same as these, because people who pray do not always say the same things
themselves, but the power, as I reckon, is always the same. So may you be kept safe as you
pray for what is necessary, and become better each day, and through a strict way of life
present your entire self well-pleasing to the Lord.</font>
