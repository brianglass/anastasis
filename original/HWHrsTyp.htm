<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">With 3 Metanias, then the Psalms.</p>

<p>Psalm 16</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Hear my justice, O Lord, attend to my supplication.
Give ear to my prayer from lips which do not deceive. Let my judgement come from your
presence, let my eyes see fair dealings. You have tested my heart, you have visited me by
night; you have tried me by fire and no injustice has been found in me. That my mouth
might not speak of men&#146;s deeds, for the sake of the words of your lips I have kept
hard ways. Direct my steps in your paths, that my steps may not slip. I have called, for
you have heard me, O God; incline your ear to me, and hear my words. Show the wonder of
your mercies, you who save those who hope in you. Guard me, Lord, like the pupil of the
eye, from those who resist your right hand. Shelter me in the shelter of your wings, from
the presence of the impious who afflicted me. My foes have surrounded my soul; they have
shut their hearts, their mouth has spoken proudly. They cast me out and now they have
encircled me, they have set their eyes to bow to the ground. They came on me like a lion
ready for prey, and like a lion cub dwelling in secret places. Arise, Lord, forestall them
and cast them down; deliver my soul from the impious, your sword from the foes of your
hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of the land in their life, and their belly was
filled from your hidden things. They have been sated with swine&#146;s flesh and left the
remainder to their infants. But I in righteousness shall be seen in your presence; I shall
be satisfied with the sight of your glory.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Psalm 24</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">To you, O Lord, I have lifted my soul. My God, I have
trusted in you, do not let me be shamed for ever. Do not let my foes laugh at me; for all
who wait patiently for you shall not be shamed; let those who transgress without cause be
shamed. O Lord, let me know your ways, and teach me your paths. Guide me into your truth
and teach me, for you are God my Saviour, and I have waited patiently on you all the day.
Remember your pity, Lord, and your mercies, for they are eternal. Do not remember the sins
and follies of my youth, according to your mercy remember me, on account of your goodness,
O Lord. The Lord is good and upright, therefore he will give laws to those who sin in the
way. He will guide the meek with judgement, he will teach the meek his ways. All the
Lord&#146;s ways are mercy and truth, for those who seek his covenant and his testimonies.
For your name&#146;s sake, O Lord, pardon my sin, for it is great. Who is a one who fears
the Lord? He will give him laws in the way which he has chosen. His soul will dwell among
good things and his seed will inherit the earth. The Lord is the strength of those who
fear him, and his covenant will show them this. My eyes are ever towards the Lord, for he
will draw my feet out of the snare. Look on me and have mercy on me; for I am alone and
poor. The afflictions of my heart have been multiplied; bring me out of my troubles. See
my humiliation and my toil, and forgive all my sins. See my foes, for they have been
multiplied, and have hated me with an unjust hatred. Guard my soul and deliver me; let me
not be shamed, for I have hoped in you. The innocent and upright have joined themselves to
me, because I have waited patiently for you, O Lord. O God, deliver Israel from all his
afflictions.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Psalm 50</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with your great
mercy. According to the multitude of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me
thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my
wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you alone I have sinned and done what is
evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words and win when you are judged.
For see, in wickedness I was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have
loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will
sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will wash me and I shall be made
whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been
humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out
from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your
salvation, and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your
ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from
bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips, and my
mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it.
You will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a
broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good
pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a
sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer
calves upon your altar.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 53</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">O God, save my by your name, and you will judge me by
your power. O God, hear my prayer, give ear to the words of my mouth. For strangers have
risen up against me, and mighty ones have sought my soul, and have not put God before
them. For see, God will help me, and the Lord is the protector of my soul. He will turn
evils upon my foes, in your truth wipe them out. Willingly I shall sacrifice to you, I
shall give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good. For you have delivered me from
every tribulation, and my eye has looked down on my foes.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Psalm 54</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Give ear to my prayer, O God, and do not despise my
supplication; attend to me, and hear me. I was grieved in my meditation, and troubled by
the voice of the foe and the tribulation of the sinner. Because they cast iniquity upon
me, and in anger they were indignant with me. My heart was troubled within me, and fear of
death fell on me. Fear and trembling came upon me, and darkness covered me. And I said:
Who will give me wings like a dove&#146;s, and I shall fly away and find rest. See, I have
gone far away in my flight, and have encamped in the wilderness. I waited for God who
saves me from faint-heartedness and from storm. O Lord, drown and divide their tongues;
because I have seen iniquity and wrangling in the city. Day and night it will go round
upon its walls, and lawlessness and toil are in its midst, and injustice. Usury and fraud
have not left its streets. For if an enemy had reviled me, I would have endured it. And if
one who hated me had boasted against me, I would have hidden from him. But it was you, a
man my equal, my guide and my friend. Who made sweet the food we ate together; we walked
in harmony in God&#146;s house. Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into
hell. For evil is in their dwellings and in their midst. But I cried to God and the Lord
heard me. At evening and morning and at midday I shall speak and declare, and you will
listen to my voice. He will redeem my soul in peace from those who draw near me, for in
crowds they were about me. God will hear and he who is before the ages will humble them.
For there is no change with them, because they have not feared God. He has stretched out
his hand to repay. They have defiled his covenant; they have been divided by the wrath
from his presence, and their have drawn near. Their words were smoother than oil, yet they
are javelins. Cast your care on the Lord, and he will support you; he will not let the
just waver for ever. But you, O God, will bring them down to the pit of destruction. Men
of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days; but I, Lord, shall hope in you.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Psalm 90</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">One who dwells in the help of the Most High will live
under the protection of the of the God of heaven; will say to the Lord: you are my
protector and my refuge, my God, and I shall hope in him. For he will deliver you from the
snare of hunters, and from the word which troubles. He will overshadow you with his wings,
and beneath his feathers you will hope; his truth will encircle you with a shield. You
will not be afraid of terror by night, of the arrow that flies by day; of the thing that
prowls in the darkness, of mishap and the noonday devil. A thousand may fall at your side,
and ten thousand at your right, but it will not come near you. But with your eyes you will
observe, and see the reward of sinners. For you, Lord, are my hope: you have made the Most
High your refuge. Evils will not approach you, nor a scourge draw near your dwelling.
Because he has given orders to his Angels about you, to guard you in all your ways. They
will bear you on their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone. You will walk on
asp and basilisk, and trample down lion and dragon. Because he hoped in me, I shall
deliver him; I shall shelter him, because he knew my name. He will cry to me, and I shall
hear him, I am with him in trouble; I shall rescue him and glorify him. I shall fill him
with length of days, and show him my salvation.</font></p>

<p>In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was
among the exiles by the river Chobar, the heavens were opened, and I saw a vision of God.
On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Joachim), the
word of the Lord came to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by
the river Chobar; and the hand of the Lord was on me. As I looked, a stormy wind came out
of the north: a great cloud with brightness around it and fire flashing forth continually,
and in the middle of the fire, an appearance of amber, and a radiance in it. In the middle
of it was a likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they were of
human form. Each had four faces, and each of them had four wings. Their legs were
straight, and their feet were winged; and there were sparks like burnished bronze. Under
their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and
their wings thus: their wings touched one another; each of them moved straight ahead,
without turning as they moved. As for the appearance of their faces: the four had the face
of a human being, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an calf on the left
side, and the face of an eagle; such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above;
each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered
their bodies. Each moved straight ahead; wherever the spirit would go, they went, without
turning as they went. In the middle of the living creatures there was an appearance that
looked like burning coals of fire, like torches moving to and fro among the living
creatures; the fire was bright, and lightning issued from the fire. The living creatures
darted to and fro, like a form of Bezek. As I looked, I saw a wheel on the earth beside
the living creatures, one for each of the four of them. As for the appearance of the
wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of beryl; and the
four had the same form, their construction being something like a wheel within a wheel.
When they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without veering as they moved.
Their rims were tall. And I saw that the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.
When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the living
creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. Wherever the cloud was, there also the
spirit would go; the living creatures went, and the wheels rose along with them; for the
spirit of life was in the wheels. </p>

<p>When the living creatures moved, the wheels also moved; when they stopped, the others
stopped; and when they rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them; for the
spirit of life was in the wheels. Over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness
of a firmament, shining like crystal, spread out above their wings. Under the firmament
their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another; and each of the creatures had
two wings covering its body. When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the
sound of mighty waters, like the voice of God Sadday, a sound of speech like the sound of
an army; when they stopped, they let down their wings. And there came a voice from above
the firmament over their heads; when they stopped, they let down their wings. And above
the firmament over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like
sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was the likeness of a human form.
Upward from what appeared like the loins I saw something like gleaming amber, something
that looked like fire enclosed all around; and downward from what looked like the loins I
saw something that looked like fire, and there was a splendour all around. Like the bow in
a cloud on a rainy day, such was the appearance of the splendour all around. This was the
appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.</p>

of rebels who have rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have transgressed against
me to this very day. The descendants are impudent and stubborn. I am sending you to them,
and you shall say to them, &#145;Thus says the Lord.&#146; Whether they hear or tremble
(for they are a rebellious house), they shall know that you are a prophet among them. And
you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, and do not be amazed at their looks, for they
will provoke and rise up against you round about, and you live among scorpions; do not be
afraid of their words, and do not be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious
house. You shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or tremble; for they are a
rebellious house. But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; do not be rebellious like
that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you. I looked, and a hand was
stretched out to me, and a written scroll was in it. He spread it before me; it had
writing on the front and on the back, and written on it were words of lamentation and
mourning and woe. He said to me, son of man, eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house
of Israel. So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat. He said to me, Son of

life-giving tree you showed the good Thief the way into Paradise and destroyed death by
death, have mercy also on us sinners and your unworthy servants. For we have sinned and
trespassed and are not worthy to raise our eyes and look on the height of heaven; because
we have abandoned the way of your justice and walked in the will of our hearts. But we
implore your unbounded goodness: spare us, O Lord, according to the multitude of your
mercy, and save us for your holy name&#146;s sake, for our days have been wasted in
vanity. Rescue us from the hand of our opponent, forgive us our sins, slay our carnal
will, that we, having put off the old man, may put on the new, and live for you, our
Master and benefactor; and that thus following your precepts we may reach eternal rest,
where those who rejoice have their dwelling. For you are the true joy and gladness of
those who love you, Christ our God, and to you we give glory, together with your Father
who has no beginning, and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and always and

begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father, through him all things were made. For
our sake and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and was incarnate from the Holy
Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man. He was crucified also for us under Pontius
Pilate, and suffered and was buried; he rose again on the third day, in accordance with
the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He
is coming again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no
end. And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life, who proceeds from the Father,
who together with Father and Son is worshipped and together glorified; who spoke through
the Prophets. In one Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the
forgiveness of sins. I await the resurrection of the dead and the life of the age to come.
