only a word you fashioned creation and brought it into being, while with ineffable words
you formed it in different ways, sent your Spirit who was borne upon it and poured out on
it the light of the sun for its renewal. You inspired your servant Moses to offer special
praise to your excellent craftsmanship and to say that you saw the light, that it was
good, and you called it Day.<a NAME="fri01"></a> As we too see this light and this radiant
sun renewing creation every day, we glorify you, the Sun of the true day and the Light
that knows no evening. Through your Son you commanded our nature to be renewed by your
Holy Spirit, so that through this gift the just might shine like the sun. We entreat you
and implore you, Father of the Word, our Lord and our God: Since by your ineffable love
for humankind and your measureless mercy creation has received renewal, as did the old
Law, as a type of the New Covenant, by your divine vision on Mount Sinai and in that
wondrous Bush, in the Tabernacle of Witness and in the Solomon&#146;s Temple of
outstanding beauty, look with a merciful eye upon us sinners and your unworthy servants,
who dwell in this House, that is as high as heaven, the boast of the inhabited world, the
true Altar of your ineffable glory. And send down your all-holy Spirit on us and upon your
inheritance, and, like godly David, renew an upright spirit in our hearts, and strengthen
us with a sovereign spirit. To our Rulers give trophies and victories over visible and
invisible enemies, and to us harmony and peace. To those, who with divine love have worked
with zeal for the construction this building and the dedication of the Church, grant
forgiveness of offences; give them their requests that are for salvation; rouse them to
the working of your commandments; bestow on them the renewal of the gift of your Holy
Spirit, so that, without condemnation, they may worship you, the only true God and Jesus
Christ whom you have sent, at the prayers of the Mother of God and of all your Saints.

</sup>and by your divine Spirit you ordered the whole earth and made new the whole
universe. Through Moses you skilfully set in order that Tabernacle of Witness and
dedicated by your Holy Spirit. You ordered Solomon the wise to build a holy and majestic
House of your ineffable glory that is beyond description and dedicated it by your Holy
Spirit. And when the glory and grace of your Holy Spirit overshadowed it you ensured that
they were seen by the Assembly of the Elders of the Jews. We beg and implore you, Word
without beginning and Son of the Father who has no beginning, that you would send down to
us at this hour the grace of your all-holy Spirit, and that you would establish and
empower the Church which has now been erected to give you glory and praise, preserving it
until the consummation of the ages, and that you would dedicate it by your Holy Spirit, so
that we, who in it offer you sacrifices without shedding of blood, may become partakers in
the Holy Spirit, who has been renewed in our inmost being, who makes firm the sovereign
