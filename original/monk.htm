have given as a sign.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Bridling every pleasure, you denied the body, O wise in God. By deeds of self-mastery
and harshness and endurance of trials you embittered your senses. In exchange for all
these you receive unending delight, perpetual pleasure and unspeakable joy.</p>

<p>Through self-mastery and brief supplication you made the passions of the body wither,
and you suffocated the crafty serpent with showers of tears, blessed and inspired Father,
and you were exceedingly well-pleasing to God. Therefore Jesus, the lover of mankind and
Saviour of our souls, adorned you with heavenly gifts of grace.</p>

<p>You finished the course of your ascetic life without swerving and you kept the faith,
therefore you were adorned with a crown of justice, which Christ, who apportions prizes as
is right and gives awards, had prepared for you, and the reward of your toils. Beseech him
to furnish us now also with these, god-bearing Father. </p>

dispassion.</font></p>

<p>When she saw Christ, the lover of mankind, crucified and pierced in the side by a
lance, the All-pure wept and cried out, &#145;What is this, my Son? Why does an ungrateful
people revenge it self on you for all the good things you did for them? And why do you
hasten to leave me childless? I am amazed, O Compassionate, at your voluntary
crucifixion&#146;.</p>

<p>You put on the death of the passions before the end, venerable father, and through

<p>Devoutly longing for the poverty of Jesus you abandoned perishable wealth and this
transient life, wise Father, and taking your cross on your shoulders you travelled to the

Therefore arise, and raise with yourself our fallen forefather.</font></p>
