<p ALIGN="left"><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The first Proemium and first Strophe are
still used in the Triodion for <a href="palm.htm">Palm Sunday</a> as Kontakion and Ikos.
The second Proemium is used as the Ypakoï for the feast. It is written in the Plagal of
the 2nd [6th] Tone. There is a problem over the refrain, which the Oxford editors take to
be &#145;Blessed are you who come to call back Adam&#146;. For reasons that are set in the
notes to a number of stanzas, I take it to be simply, &#145;Who come to call back
Adam&#146;. The basic texts from the Gospel are Matt. 21,1-17; Mark 11,1-18; Luke
19,29-46; John 12,12-19.</font></big></p>

notes, I have linked them to the text by hyperlinks. As there are not many notes to each
stanza, it should be clear to which note each hyperlink refers.</big></font></p>

The one they were plotting to kill they did not know, the sons of falsehood!<br>
What they say is not strange. They are repeating the past.<br>
