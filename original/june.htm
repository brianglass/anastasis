<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4"><b>10. Of the holy martyrs Alexander and Antonina.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4"><b>11. Of the holy Apostles Bartholomew and
Barnabas.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3"><b>Bartholomew</b> was one of the Twelve, a native
of Galilee. This is all we know for certain about him from the Gospels. About his
apostolic work all say that he preached in Arabia and Persia and above all to the Indians,
to whom he brought the Gospel of Matthew written in Hebrew, which Pantenus, a stoic
philosopher and an outstanding teacher in the Christian school of Alexandria, found there
a hundred years later (Eusebius, Eccl. Hist. V.19). He died according to the usual view by
crucifixion, or by being flayed alive, at Albanopolis in Armenia, as is clear from the
ancient and reliable tradition of the Armenians. Some hold that Bartholomew and Nathanael
are one and the same, because, they say, that while the call of Bartholomew appears
nowhere, that of Nathanael is mentioned (Jo.1:46-52); that the evangelists who speak of
Bartholomew say nothing of Nathanael, while John, who alone mentions him, says nothing of
Bartholomew; that Bartholomew is not properly his name, but a patronymic which means
&#145;son of Tholomaios&#146;, which when translated means &#145;one who hangs up or
checks waters&#146;, and is formed on Greek models from the Hebrew Tolmi or Tolmai
(Josh.15:14; II Kingd.3:3). Bartholomew, then, means &#145;son of Tholomaios&#146; or
&#145;Ptolomaios&#146; - since the name is also found written Bar-ptolomaios), just as
Bartimaios means &#145;son of Timaios&#146; (Mk 10:46), and this therefore could be his
surname, while Nathanael is his proper name. Finally they say that John seems to number
Nathanael with the Apostles where he says: &#145;There were together Simon Peter and
Thomas, called Twin, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee&#145; (Jo.21:2).</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3"><b>Barnabas</b> was a native of Cyprus and one of
the Seventy, a Levite by tribe and a fellow pupil with Paul under Gamaliel. At first he
was called Joses, but his name was later changed to Barnabas, which means &#145;son of
consolation&#146;, no doubt to differentiate him from the other Joses, called Barsabas and
nicknamed &#145;Justus&#146;. This Barnabas owned some land which he sold and brought the
money to the Apostles (Acts 1:23 and 4:36-37). He evangelised many places as Paul&#146;s
travelling companion and on his own. Finally he underwent a martyr&#146;s death, stoned by
the Jews in his native land after the year 51. In the reign of Zeno, in 478, his sacred
relics were found, with the Gospel according to Matthew, written in Greek in
Barnabas&#146; own hand, on his chest, and were offered to Zeno. From the latter the
archbishop of Cyprus received the privilege of signing his name in scarlet letters.</font></p>

you. Through her prayers, as you are merciful, save our souls!</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4"><b>14. Of the holy prophet Elisaius; and of our
father among the saints Methodios, patriarch of Constantinople, the Confessor.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">The prophet, the son of Saphat, was from the city of
Abel-Meoul, or Abel-Neoul, in the land of Manassee. His earlier profession was that of
farmer. In the year 908 BC., on orders from God, the prophet Elias anointed him as prophet
in his place, when he was ploughing the land with twelve yoke of oxen. These he
slaughtered on the spot and using the ploughs and other wooden farm implements he roasted
them and gave them as food to the people. When he had said good-bye to his relatives he
followed Elias and served him until the latter&#146;s assumption into heaven (July 20th).
Having received his teacher&#146;s cloak and a double gift of his prophetic spirit, he
showed by the wonderful works, which the Fourth Book of Kingdoms recounts of him, whose
disciple he was indeed. He lived until 839 BC. and died full of years and was buried in
Samaria. But God also glorified him after his death, because a year later as a corpse was
being carried out for burial, the bearers suddenly catching sight of a band of Moabite
robbers threw the corpse onto the prophet&#146;s tomb and fled. But hardly had the corpse
come near the bones of the prophet than it came back to life at once and stood up on its
feet (IV Kingd.13:20-21). Sirach also mentions this when he says: </font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">&#145;</font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">In his life
he worked miracles; and in his death his works were wonderful</font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">&#145;</font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3"> (48:44). By
this the reverence of the faithful for the relics of the saints is increased, and the
devout opinion of the Orthodox Church about them is justified (Jan.16th).</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3"><b>Methodios</b> was born in Syracuse in Sicily of
wealthy parents towards the end of the 8th century. As a priest he was sent to Rome as a
legate around 815-816 by Nikephoros of Constantinople, who had been banished by Leo the
Armenian (June 2nd). After his death he returned to Constantinople, but as a zealot for
the honour of the holy images he was banished on the spot to the little island of Andrew
the First-called, which lies off Akritis near Bithynia, by the emperor Michael the
Stammerer. When he too died, he was briefly freed, but was imprisoned again by Theophilos
for the same zeal in a pitch dark prison, as if in a tomb, where he was fed by a poor
fisherman. Finally, when the Church recovered her freedom under the empress Theodora, he
once more ascended the patriarchal throne of Constantinople in 842, which he governed for
four years and died in 846. He contributed to the re-erection of the holy images.</font></p>

testifies himself (Am.7:44-45). He began to prophesy two years before the earthquake
(ibid.1:1), which the critics date to the twenty fifth year of the reign of Ozias, king of
Juda, around 785 BC. Later the false priest of Bethel, Amasias, brought about his death.

his godly apostolate as a martyr in Beirut, as they say, around the year 80. His is the
last of the Catholic Epistles, written to the faithful Jews in the diaspora after the
capture of Jerusalem by Vespasian.</font></p>

testimony of God himself a prophet higher than all the prophets (Matt.11:9-11), Elizabeth,
old and barren, gave birth to, filling all her relatives and neighbours with joy and
wonder after her child-bearing. But far more wonderful was what happened afterwards, on
the eighth day, the day of the circumcision and the child&#146;s naming. Those present
called him by his father&#146;s name, Zachary. The mother, under divine inspiration,
answered and said: No, but he is to be called John. The father being asked about this
requested by signs, for he was unable to speak (Sept.23), a writing tablet and wrote: John
will be his name. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue freed from it nine
month bondage, and filled with the Holy Spirit he sang the second of the New Testament
canticles, blessing the God of Israel, who had fulfilled the promises made to his fathers,
who had visited those who sat in darkness and the shadow of death and had sent out to them
his saving light. He prophesies too about the child, that he will be called the prophet of
the Most High and Forerunner of Jesus Christ (Lk 1:57-79). </font><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#000080" size="3">&#146;</font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">But the child John, who appeared full of grace, grew (says the evangelist) and

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="5"><b>29. Of the holy, glorious and
all-praised Princes of the Apostles, Peter and Paul.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Of these, <b>Peter</b>, blest of God, was from
Bethsaida in Galilee, son of Jonas, brother of Andrew the First-called, a fisherman by
trade, a private citizen and a poor man. He was called Simon at first, but later his name
was changed to Peter by Jesus himself when he looked on him and said: You are Simon, son
of Jonas, you will be called Cephas, which means Peter (Jo.1:43). Raised by the Lord the
rank of apostle he became inseparable from him and a zealous disciple. He followed him
from the beginning of his saving preaching until the Passion, in the courtyard of the High
Priest Caiaphas; where he denied Christ three times through his fear of the Jews and the
imminent danger. But through the most bitter tears he once again received pardon of his
own offence. After Christ&#146;s Resurrection and the Descent of the All-holy Spirit he
preached him in Judea, Antioch and certain areas of Asia, finally reaching Rome, where,
crucified by Nero, head downwards and feet upwards, he departed to the eternal dwellings
in the year 66 or 68. He left to Christ&#146;s Church two Catholic Epistles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">The inspired <b>Paul</b>, Christ&#146;s vessel of
election, the glory of the Church, the Apostle of the nations and teacher of the whole
world, was Jewish by race, of the tribe of Benjamin, Tarsus his fatherland, a Roman
citizen by rank, knowledgeable in the Greek language, highly skilled in the science of the
teachers of the Law, a Pharisee by order, born of a Pharisee father and a pupil under the
Pharisee Gamaliel, the celebrated teacher of the Law in Jerusalem. And as a result a most
fervent zealot at the start for his ancestral traditions, and a dedicated persecutor of
Christ&#146;s Church, called at time Saulos or Saul (Acts 22:3-4). In around the year 36
when, under the violent impulse of his frenzy and rage against the Lord&#146;s disciples
he had set out for Damascus, bearing letters of authorisation from the High Priest to
bring from there bound to Jerusalem all those he might find who believed in the Christ, he
was nearing the city at mid-day, he was suddenly surrounded by a heavenly light and
falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him: Saoul, Saoul, why do you persecute
Me? And on his asking: Who are you, Lord? he heard again: I am Jesus whom you persecute.
It is hard for you to kick against the goad. The heavenly voice and the flood of light
filled him with terror and blinded him for a time. He was led by the hand into the city
and when he had been baptised according to a divine revelation by the apostle Ananias
(Oct.1st), he opened both his bodily and spiritual eyes to recognise the Sun of justice
that had dawned. And immediately - O how wonderful a change! - he spoke boldly in the
synagogues, and, against every expectation of the Jews, proclaimed Christ, that He is the
Son of God (Acts 9:1-20).</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">His subsequent zeal for the preaching of the Gospel,
his numberless toils and manifold tribulations, the blows, the imprisonments, the
beatings, the stonings, the shipwrecks, the journeyings, the dangers on land and sea, in
cities and deserts, the constant vigils, the daily fasts, the penury, thirst and
nakedness, and all the other things that he underwent for the name of Christ, which he
carried before nations and kings and Israelites, and above all his care for all the
Churches, his burning longing for the salvation of all, through which he became all things
to all men, that he might, if possible, save all, by which, his heart aflame, he
constantly journeyed to visit them all, and like a bird he flew to Asia and Europe, to
East and West, staying nowhere, stopping nowhere: all these are recounted in detail in the
book of Acts and by himself in his Epistles. His Epistles, which number fourteen and have
been expounded in 250 homilies by Saint Chrysostom, display the elevation of his thoughts,
greatness of th revelations granted him and the wisdom given him by God, through which he
wonderfully traverses the Old with the New Testament, expounding the mysteries of the
latter, which were hidden under types in the former; he enlarges the ethical teaching the
Gospel and precisely explains the duties of each rank and age and condition of men. In all
this having established his mouth as a spiritual trumpet and his tongue as brighter than
the sun, through them he made the word of truth sound clearly and enlightened the ends of
the inhabited world. Finally, when he had fulfilled the work of his ministry, he too died
a martyr, beheaded in Rome itself under Nero, at the same time, some say, as St Peter was
crucified.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">The change of his name occurs in Acts, when at
Paphos in Cyprus he converted the proconsul, who was a pagan named Sergius Paulus, to
Christ (13:6-12). The reason is that while a Jew by race and religion he was called Saul,
as a Roman by citizenship, being born in Tarsus in Cilicia, he was also called Paul, and
when he began to preach the word of God to the pagans he used this second name, as more
usual and better known to the Greeks and Romans. Such is the view of some.</font></p>
