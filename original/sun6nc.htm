<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 1. Tone 6.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>We sing the praise of three divine persons of one single nature, an unchanging form, a
God who is good and loves humankind and grants us atonement of faults. </p>

<p>O Lord, alone beyond being, in persons shining with triple light, existing in one
Godhead, give us understanding and count us worthy of your divine radiance.</p>

<p>Paul, who espoused the Church from the nations, taught her to worship you, one God in
three persons, from whom and through whom and in whom all things have come to be.</font></p>

of the Godhead of triple light. As we devoutly sing his praise we call you blessed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 3. </font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>O God of triple light, who set in order the heavenly Ranks and fitted them to sing you
with thrice-holy voices, accept us too with them as we sing the praise of your goodness.</p>

<p>As we sing the praise of the only unchanging, triple, consubstantial, single Godhead,
we beseech you fervently to send down to us now pardon of our many sins.</p>

<p>O Father, Mind without beginning, O consubstantial Word of God and divine Spirit, good
and upright, guard all who faithfully sing your praise, as you are compassionate.</font></p>

<p>O God and Master, look from heaven. See our humiliation as you are full of pity, and
have compassion, O Lover of humankind supremely good. For we hope to obtain pardon from no
one else for the evils which we have committed. Therefore be with us, and no one against
us.</p>

all-immaculate, and heal the burning heat of our conscience with the dew of your mercy,
crying out to your servants I am with you, and no one against you.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Raise the mind and swiftly make the heart of those who sing your praise mount up, O
Unity with triple light, and count them worthy of your radiance and splendour. </p>

<p>Alter my form and transfigure me from every wickedness into virtue, O Trinity alone
unalterable and unchanging; make me resplendent with the beams of your radiance.</p>

<p>Having first considered all with wisdom, you gave being to the ministering ranks of the
Angels of your goodness, O three-personned Unity; with them accept my praise.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 5. </font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>As we consider the divine nature, which cares for and saves all, is one and with triple
light, Master, we rise to you at dawn asking pardon for our offences. </p>

<p>God and Father without beginning, co-eternal Son and holy Spirit, Trinity ruling as
one, establish those who sing your praise and deliver them from every assault and
affliction.</p>

<p>O Sun of glory who train me with your divinely working radiance and ever guide me to be
well-pleasing to your three-personned Godhead, make me a partaker of your divine Kingdom.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 7. </font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Unity with triple light by persons, bestow on me a vigorous mind to keep and to guard
your divine commandments and always to chant to you with faith: Blessed are you, the God
of our Fathers.</p>

<p>As praised with identity of nature, God ineffably single but by persons bearing the
number of the Trinity, guard us all from temptations and calamities of many kinds.</p>

<p>We glorify you, one God by essence, consubstantial and co-eternal, unconfused in
properties of persons, O Trinity, putting forward the difference simply, in form clearly
unchanging.</font></p>

<p>The ranks of Cherubim, Master, unable to look at the glory of your beauty, veiled by
their wings unceasingly cry aloud the triple hymn as they glorify the three-personned
might of your single Godhead. </p>

<p>O Sun who never set, grant your radiance to the hearts of your servants, enlighten
their souls and ransom them from many offences, O only all-merciful and Three-personned,
and count us worthy of your unsullied life.</p>

<p>O Godhead, who are light of equal honour and of triple sun and which gives light,
illumine those who sing you with faith and deliver them from gloomy evil doing, and count
them worthy of your shining tabernacles, O supremely good.</font></p>
