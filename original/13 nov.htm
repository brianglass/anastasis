<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The memory of the just is praised, and the Lord's blessing is upon his head. Blessed is
one who has found wisdom; a mortal who knows understanding. To import her is better that
treasures of gold and silver. She is more valuable than precious stones; nothing of value
equals her worth. Justice proceeds from her mouth; she carries law and mercy on its
tongue. Therefore, my children, listen to me; for I speak weighty things; and blest the
one who keeps my ways. For my goings out are the goings out of life, and favour is
prepared from the Lord. Therefore I exhort you, and utter my voice to the children of men.
Because I, Wisdom, have prepared counsel, I have called upon knowledge and understanding.
Mine are counsel and sureness; mine is prudence, mine is strength. I love those who are my
friends, while those who seek me will find grace. You innocent, understand cunning; you
untaught, take it to heart. Listen to me, for I will speak weighty things, and I will open
right things from my lips. Because my throat will meditate truth; lying lips are
abominable before me. All the words of my mouth are with justice, there is nothing crooked
in them nor twisted. They are all straight for those who understand, and right for those
who find knowledge. For I teach you what is true, that your hope may be in the Lord and
that you may be filled with spirit.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the Wisdom of Solomon.<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Selection.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The mouth of a just man distils wisdom; the lips of men know graces. The mouth of the
wise meditates wisdom; justice delivers them from death. When a just man dies hope is not
lost; for a just son is born for life, and among his good things he will pluck the fruit
of justice. There is light at all times for the just, and they will find grace and glory
from the Lord. The tongue of the wise knows what is good, and wisdom will takes its rest
in their hearts. The Lord loves holy hearts; while all who are blameless in the way are
acceptable to him. The wisdom of the Lord will enlighten the face of the understanding;
for she anticipates those who desire her before they know it, and is easily contemplated
by those who love her. One who rises for her at dawn will not toil, and one who keeps
vigil because of her will be without care. For she goes about seeking those who are worthy
of her, and shows itself favourably to those in the ways. Wickedness will never prevail
against wisdom. Because of this I too became a lover of her beauty and became her friend,
and I sought her out from my youth, and I sought to take her as my bride; because the
Master of all things loved her. For she is an initiate of the knowledge of God one who
chooses his works. Her toils are virtues; she teaches sobriety and prudence; justice and
courage, than which nothing is more useful in human life. If anyone longs for much
experience, she knows how to compare things of old and things that are to come. She knows
the twists of words and the explanations of riddles; she foresees signs and wonders and
the outcomes of seasons and times. And to all she is a good counsellor. Because
immortality is in her, and fame in the fellowship of her words. Therefore I appealed to
the Lord and besought him and said from my whole heart: God of my Fathers and Lord of
mercy, who made all things by your word, and established humanity by your wisdom to be
master over the creatures that had come into being by you, and to order the world in
holiness and justice; give me Wisdom who sits by your throne, and do not reject me from
among your children, for I am your servant and the son of your maid servant. Send her out
from your holy dwelling and from the throne of your glory, that she may be present and
teach me what is pleasing before you. And let her guide me with knowledge and guard me
with her glory. For all the thoughts of mortals are wretched and their ideas are unstable.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the Wisdom of Solomon.<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Selection.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>When the just is praised, peoples are glad; for immortality is his memory, because it
is known both to God and men, and his soul is pleasing to the Lord. Therefore, O men,
desire wisdom, and long for it and be instructed. For her beginning is love and keeping of
laws. Honour Wisdom, that you may reign for ever. I will declare to you and not hide from
you the mysteries of God Because he is both the guide of Wisdom and the One who sets right
the wise; and in his hand are all prudence, and knowledge of works. The artificer of all
things, Wisdom, taught me; for in her is an understanding holy spirit, brightness of the
eternal light, image of the goodness of God. She makes them friends of God and prophets.
She is more lovely than the sun, and beyond every order of the stars; compared to light,
she is found before it. She delivered her devotees from toils, and guided them in straight
paths. She gave them holy knowledge and protected them from those who lay in ambush for
them, she awarded them a mighty contest, that all might know that true religion is more
powerful than all, and that wickedness can never prevail against Wisdom, nor will justice
in passing sentence overlook the evil. For they said in themselves, not reasoning
correctly: Let us overpower the just, let us not spare his saintliness, nor feel reverence
for the aged grey hairs of an elder; let our strength be law. Let us lie in ambush for the
just, for he is a hindrance to us and he is opposed to our works and alleges the sins of
our upbringing. He claims to have knowledge of God, and calls himself a child of the Lord.
He has become a reproof to our thoughts. He is grievous for us even to look at; for his
life is not like others and his paths are quite different. We are reckoned by him to be
counterfeit, and he keeps away from our ways as from filth; he calls the end of the just
blest. Let us see if his words are true, and let us test what will happen to him at the
end. Let us examine him by insult and torture, that we may know his forbearance and make
trial of his patience. Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for by his own words he
will have protection. This was how they argued, and they were deceived; for their
wickedness had blinded them. And they did not know the mysteries of God, nor did they
judge that you alone are God who have authority over life and death, and who save in time
of tribulation, and deliver from every ill; pitying and merciful, giving grace to your
holy ones, and by your right arm resisting the proud.</font></p>

<p>As with understanding we attend to your words, O Chrysostom, we are initiated into the
mystery of theology and pluck all the enjoyment of good thongs, and flee the harm of
wickedness; for you have become the general guardian of salvation, crying out: Highly
exalt Christ to the ages.</p>

<p>Entreat the Master, Chrysostom, on our behalf, employing your compassionate freedom to
speak, Father, and your merciful and benevolent love; for with faith we put you forward to
the Saviour as mediator, champion and fervent advocate, inspired Hierarch, all-blessed
John.</p>

<p>To rulers who acted unjustly you showed a young man&#146;s resistance, a mind not to be
humbled, warmly championing those who had be wronged, Venerable Father, and orphans,
widows and paupers with a loving disposition, as you cried: Highly exalt Christ to the
ages.</font></p>

teachings, truly a torrent of delight, a channel of forgiveness and bright herald of
repentance.</p>
