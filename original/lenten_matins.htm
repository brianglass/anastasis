<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5">NOTE</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Most books prescribe the
prayer O God save your people before psalm 50. This is anomalous, since
liturgically it is linked to the order for the Gospel. It is omitted in the
Ieratikon issued by the Holy Monastery of Simonos Petra on the Holy Mountain. I
have given a reference to it in brackets at the appropriate point.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">It is customary on the Holy
Mountain to do a full censing during the first Ode of the Canon, whichever that
may be, as on Sundays and Feasts.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">The place at which the
Troparia of the Canons are inserted vary from typikon to typikon. The standard
Russian use is described in the translation of the Lenten Triodion by Mother
Mary and Bishop Kallistos. Current Athonite practice is to insert the Troparia
from the Menaion after the first four verses of the Biblical Canticle, and then
recite the remaining verses, until the point at which the Canons from the
Triodion are inserted, that is from 8 onwards.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">The Triodion does not give
precise references for the daily readings from <a href="ephrem.htm">St Ephrem
the Syrian</a> and the Lausiac History of Palladios, nor more than it does for
the reading from the ladder at the Hours. Some suitable material from St Ephrem
will be found elsewhere on my pages.</font></p>

sacrifice, and accept with favour your whole burnt offering. May the Lord give
you your heart’s desire, and fulfil your every purpose. We shall rejoice in
your salvation, and be magnified in the name of our the Lord our God. May the
Lord fulfil all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ.
He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty acts is the salvation of his
right hand. Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will
call on the name of the Lord our God. They were fettered and fell, but we have
risen and been set upright. Lord, save the king, and hear us on the day we call
upon you.</p>

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The king will rejoice in your power, O
Lord, he will exult exceedingly in your salvation. You gave him his heart’s
desire; you did not deny him the request of his lips. For you came to meet him
with blessings of goodness; you placed a crown of precious stones upon his head.
He asked you for life, and you gave him length of days for age on age. Great is
his glory because of your salvation; you will place on him glory and majesty.
For you will give him blessing for age on age, and make him glad with the joy of
your countenance. For the king puts his hope in the Lord, and through the mercy
of the Most High he will not be shaken. May your hand light upon all your
enemies, and your right hand find out all who hate you. You will make them like
a blazing oven at the time of your presence. The Lord will confound them in his
wrath and fire will devour them. You will destroy their offspring from the
earth, and their seed from among the children of mankind. Because they intended
evils against you, and devised plans by which they can in no way succeed. For
you will put them to flight; among your remnants you will prepare their

<p>Psalm 3</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
Lord, why have those who afflict me been multiplied? Many rise against me. Many
say to my soul, ‘There is no salvation for him in his God’. But you, Lord,
are my helper, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. With my voice, I
cried to the Lord, and he heard me from his holy mountain. I lay down and slept;
I awoke, because the Lord will assist me. I will not be afraid of tens of
thousands of people who surround me. Rise, Lord, save me, my God; because you
have struck all who are vainly my foes. You have smashed the teeth of sinners.
Salvation is the Lord’s, and your blessing is upon your people.</p>

<p>Psalm 37</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chastise me in your wrath. For your
arrows have been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a heavy hand upon me. There
is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in my bones on
account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my head; like a heavy burden they
weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank and festered on account of my
foolishness. I was wretched and utterly bowed down; I went about mourning all
day long. For my loins were filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my
flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated exceedingly; I howled from the groaning
of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning was not hidden
from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and even the light of my
eyes had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and stood against
me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life used force,
and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and meditated trickeries all
day long. But I, like a deaf man, heard nothing; like one who is dumb, who does
not open his mouth. So I became like one who cannot hear, and in whose mouth
there are no rebukes. For in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will answer me, O Lord
my God. For I said: Let my foes never exult over me. When my foot slipped they
crowed over me. For I am ready for blows and my pain is with me continually. For
I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my sin. But my enemies live and
have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly have been multiplied.
Those who repay me with evils in place of good have slandered me, since I
pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not go far from me. Hasten
to help me, Lord of my salvation.</p>

O God, my God, I watch for you at dawn; my soul has thirsted for you, my flesh
how often in a desert, untrodden and waterless land. Thus I appeared before you
in the holy place, to see your power and your glory. For your mercy is better
than life; my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live, and
in your name I will lift up my hands. May my soul be filled as with marrow and
fatness; my mouth will praise you with joyful lips. When I remembered you upon
my bed, every dawn I meditated upon you. For you became my helper, and in the
shelter of your wings I shall rejoice. My soul clung to you; and your right hand
upheld me. But those who vainly sought my life will go down to the deepest parts
of the earth, they will be delivered to the power of the sword, they will be

<p>Psalm 87</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day, and by night also before you.
Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to my supplication. For
my soul was filled with evils, and my life drew near to Hell. I was reckoned
among those that go down to the Pit; I became as one that has no help, free
among the dead. Like the slain that sleep in the tomb, whom you remembered no
more; and they were cut off from your power. They placed me in the lowest Pit;
in darkness and in the shadow of death. Your wrath lay heavy upon me, and you
brought all your waves against me. You put my friends far from me, and made me
an abomination to them. I was handed over and I came out; my eyes grew weak
because of my beggary. I cried to you, Lord, all the day; I stretched out my
hands towards you. Will you work wonders for the dead; or will physicians raise
them up again to praise you? Will any declare your mercy in the tomb, or your
truth in the place of destruction? Will your wonders be known in the dark, or
your justice in a land that has been forgotten? But to you, Lord, I have cried,
and in the morning my prayer will come before you. Why have you rejected my
soul, Lord; why do you turn away your face from me? I am poor and in toils since
my youth; exalted, I was humbled and brought to despair. Your fierce anger
overwhelmed me, and your terrors appalled me. They surrounded me like water all
day long; they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour you have
put far from me, and my companions because of my misery.</p>

<p>Psalm 102<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all
that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget
none of his benefits. He forgives all your iniquities; he heals all your
diseases; he redeems your life from corruption and crowns you with mercy and
compassion; he satisfies your desire with good things; your youth will be
renewed like an eagle’s. The Lord performs deeds of mercy and judgement for
all who are oppressed. He made known his ways to Moses, his wishes to the
children of Israel. The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and
full of mercy. He will not always be wrathful, nor will he be enraged for ever.
He has not dealt with us according to our iniquities, nor rewarded us according
to our sins. For, like the height of heaven above the earth, the Lord has made
his mercy prevail over those that fear him. As far as the east is from the west,
so far has he taken our sins from us. As a father takes pity on his children the
Lord has taken pity on those who fear him. For he knows of what we are made; has
remembered that we are but dust. As for man, his days are but as grass, he will
blossom like a flower of the field; for when a wind has passed over it, it will
be no more and will know its place no longer. But the mercy of the Lord is for
ever and ever upon those who fear him; and his justice upon their children’s
children, upon those who keep his covenant and remember his commandments to do
them. The Lord has prepared his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all.
Bless the Lord, all you his Angels, powerful in strength, who perform his word,
and listen to the voice of his words. Bless the Lord, all you his Powers, his
Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord, all you his works. In every place of
his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul!</p>

For the enemy pursued my soul; humbled my life to the ground; made me dwell in

troubled within me. I remembered days of old; I meditated on all your works. I
made the works of your hands my meditation. I stretched out my hands towards
you; my soul thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord; my
spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who

<p>Have mercy on me O God, in accordance with your great mercy; according to the
multitude of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me thoroughly from my
wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my wickedness, and my
sin is ever before me. Against you only I have sinned and done what is evil in
your sight, that you may be justified in your words, and win when you are
judged. For see, in wickedness I was conceived, and in sin my mother bore me.
For see, you have loved truth: you have shown me the hidden and secret things of
your wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed; you will
wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and
gladness; the bones which have been humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face
from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God,
and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out from your presence, and
do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your salvation,
and establish me with a sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your ways,
and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me
from bloodshed, and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open
my lips: and my mouth will declare your praise. For if you had wanted a
sacrifice, I would have given it; you will not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a broken and a humbled heart God will not
despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good pleasure; and let the walls of
Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a sacrifice of
righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer calves
upon your altar.</p>

Let us sing to the Lord, for he is greatly glorified.</p>
<p>Let us sing to the Lord, for he is greatly glorified: horse and rider he has
cast into the sea.</p>
<p>Helper and protector he has become for my salvation: he is my God and I will
glorify him; my father’s God and I will exalt him.</p>
<p>The Lord shatters wars, the Lord is his name.</p>
<p>Pharaoh’s chariots and army he has cast into the sea; his chosen mounted
captains he has drowned in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>With the deep he covered them: they sank to the bottom like a stone.</p>
<p>Your right hand, Lord, has been glorified with strength; your right hand,
Lord, has crushed enemies; and by the multitude of your glory you have smashed
the opponents.</p>
<p>You sent forth your anger, it consumed them like a reed.</p>
<p>And through the spirit of your wrath the water parted; the waters became
fixed like a wall, and the waves became fixed in the midst of the sea.</p>
<p>The enemy said: I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, I
will fill my soul, I will destroy with my sword, my right hand shall lord it.</p>
<p>You sent forth your spirit, the sea covered them, they sank like lead in a
mass of water.</p>
<p>Who is like you among the gods, Lord? Who is like you? Glorified in holiness,
wondrous in glories, performing marvels.</p>
<p>You stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them down.</p>
<p>You guided this people of yours, which you have redeemed; by your strength
you have called them into your holy resting-place.</p>

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">After the law was written, once more a
song of Moses.</p>
<p>Attend, O heaven, and I shall speak; and let earth hear the words from my
mouth.</p>
<p>Let my utterance be looked for like rain, and let my words come down like
dew, like a shower upon herbage, and like snow on grass.</p>
<p>Because I have called on the name of the Lord; ascribe majesty to our God.</p>
<p>God, his works are true, and all his ways judgements.</p>
<p>God is faithful, and there is no injustice in him; just and holy the Lord.</p>
<p>Blameworthy children, have they not sinned against him; perverse and crooked
generation, do you thus repay the Lord?</p>
<p>Foolish this people, and not wise; is he not your Father who created you, and
made you, and fashioned you?</p>
<p>Remember days of old, understand years, generations of generations.</p>
<p>Question your father, and he will tell you; your elders and they will speak
to you.</p>
<p>When the Most High divided the nations, when he scattered the children of
Adam, he set boundaries for the nations according to the number of the Angels of
God.</p>
<p>And his people Jacob became the Lord’s portion; Israel the line of his
inheritance.</p>
<p>He sustained them in the desert, in thirst from heat in a waterless land; he
encircled him and instructed him and guarded him as the apple of his eye.</p>
<p>As an eagle longed to protect its brood, and its nestlings, spreading its
wings, he received them and bore them up on his pinions.</p>
<p>The Lord alone led them, and their was no foreign god with them.</p>
<p>He made them mount on the strength of the land; he fed them with the produce
of the fields.</p>
<p>They sucked honey from a rock, and oil from a solid rock.</p>
<p>Butter from oxen and milk from sheep, with the fat of lambs and rams, of the
offspring of bulls and goats, with the fat of kidneys, of wheat, and they drank
wine, the blood of the grape.</p>
<p>And Jacob ate and was filled, and the beloved kicked; he grew sleek, he grew
fat, he was broadened and abandoned the God who made him, and rebelled from God
his saviour.</p>
<p>They provoked me with foreign [gods], and embittered me with their
abominations.</p>
<p>They sacrificed to demons and not to God; to gods they had not known; new
ones, recently arrived, whom their fathers had not known.</p>
<p>You abandoned the God who begot you, and forgot the God who nurtures you.</p>
<p>And the Lord saw and grew jealous, and was provoked through anger of his sons
and daughters.</p>
<p>And he said: I shall turn away my face from them, and I shall show them what
will happen to them at the last; because it is a perverse generation; children
who have no faith in them.</p>
<p>They have moved me to jealousy over what is not god, they have angered me by
their idols; I too will move them to jealousy over what is not a nation, over a
nation without understanding I shall anger them.</p>
<p>Because fire has been kindled from my wrath, it will kindled as far as the
lowest hell; it devours the earth and its produce; it will consume the
foundations of the mountains.</p>
<p>I shall gather evils against them, and exhaust my arrows against them.</p>

<p>My heart is established in the Lord, my spirit is exalted in my God: my mouth

<p>There is none holy like the Lord, and none just like our God.</p>

<p>Lord, I heard your report and was afraid: Lord I considered your works and

<p>In the midst of two living creatures you will be known, when the years draw
near you will be recognised, when the moment comes you will be revealed. When my
soul is troubled, in anger you will remember mercy.</p>
<p>God will come from Theman: and the Holy One from a shady, wooded mountain.</p>

instead of toils I saw his everlasting paths.</p>
<p>The tents of the Ethiopians quivered with fear, and the tabernacles of the

<p>Were you enraged at rivers, Lord? Was your wrath at rivers? Or your
indignation at the sea? Because you mounted on your horses, and your cavalry is

your anointed ones, you hurled death on the heads of the lawless, you raised
bonds as far as the neck to the end.</p>
<p>You cut open in amazement the heads of the powerful; they will be shaken by
them, they will break open their bridles, like a poor man eating in secret.</p>
<p>And you made your horses mount upon the sea, as they troubled many waters.</p>

Praise of the three holy Youths quenches a flame.<br>
Our God and the God of our fathers, blessed are you.</p>
<p>Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers: and praised and glorified is
your name for evermore.</p>
<p>For you are just in all that you have done for us.</p>
<p>And all your works are true, and your ways are right, and all your judgements
are true: and judgements of truth you have executed in all that you have brought
upon us.</p>
<p>And upon Jerusalem the city of our fathers. Because in truth you have brought
all these things upon us, because of our sins.</p>
<p>Because we have sinned and committed iniquity in departing from you, and we
have sinned in all things, and we have not obeyed your commandments, nor kept
them, nor have we done as you commanded us, that it might be well with us.</p>
<p>And all that you have done to us, and all that you have brought upon us, you
have done with true judgement; and you handed us over into the hands of our
lawless foes, hateful rebels, and to an unjust and king, the most evil in all
the earth.</p>
<p>And now we cannot open our mouth; we have become a shame and disgrace to your
servants, and to those who honour you.</p>
<p>Do not hand us over for ever, for your holy name’s sake, and do not annul
your testament, and do not withdraw your mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham
your beloved, and Isaac your servant, and Israel your holy one.</p>
<p>To whom you said that you would multiply their seed as the stars of heaven,
and as the sand that is by the shore of the sea.</p>
<p>Because, Master, we have become smaller than all the nations, and we are
humbled in all the earth to-day because of our sins.</p>
<p>And at this moment there is neither prince, nor prophet nor leader; neither
holocaust, nor sacrifice, not offering, nor incense; no place to make an
offering before you and to find mercy.</p>
<p>Yet with a contrite heart and with a spirit of humility may we be accepted.</p>
<p>As though with holocausts of rams and bulls and tens of thousands of fat
lambs, so may our sacrifice be acceptable before you to-day, and may it be
perfected behind you; because there is no shame for those who trust in you.</p>
<p>And now we are following you with our whole heart, and we fear you, and seek
your face; do not put us to shame.</p>
<p>But do with us according to your fairness, and according to the multitude of
your mercy.</p>
<p>deliver us according to your wondrous works, and give glory to your name, O
Lord.</p>
<p>And let all who harm your servants be disgraced, and put to shame from all
their power, and let their strength be smashed.</p>
<p>And let them know that you alone are Lord God, and glorious in the whole
inhabited world.</p>

O God.</p>
<p>Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all you stars and light.</p>
<p>Praise him, you highest heavens and you waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>For he spoke and they came into being; he commanded and they were created.</p>
<p>He established them for ever and ever; he made an ordinance, and it shall not
pass away.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord from the earth; praise him, you sea-monsters and all deeps;</p>
