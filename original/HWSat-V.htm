<p>Psalm 103<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you have
been greatly magnified. You have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping
yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his
upper chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind,
making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its
sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle;
waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at
the voice of your thunder. The mountains rise and the plains descend to the place which
you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return
to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the
mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await
them to quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling:
and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will
be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green
herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the
human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human heart.
The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There
the sparrows will build their nests; the heron&#146;s dwelling is at their head. The high
mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the
seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night,
in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to
seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they will lie
down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How
your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth
has been filled with your creation. Also this great, wide sea; there there are creeping
things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go to and fro; this
dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to you to give them their food
in due season. When you give it them, they will gather it. When you open your hand all
things will be filled with goodness. But when you turn away your face they will be
troubled. You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust.
You will send forth your spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of
the earth. May the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his
works. He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they
smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. May my
words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners
might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no more. Bless the Lord, my
soul!</font></p>

<p>In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth. Now the earth was invisible and
unformed, and darkness was upon the deep and a spirit of God was being borne upon the
water. And God said: Let there be light, and there was light. And God saw the light, that
it was good; and God made a separation between the light and the darkness. And God called
the light Day, and the darkness he called Night; and there was evening and there was
morning, one day. And God said: Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water and let
there be a separation between the water and the water; and it was so. And God made the
firmament; and God made a separation between the water, which was below the firmament, and
between the water which was above the firmament. And God called the firmament Heaven; and
God saw that it was good, and there was evening and there was morning, a second day. And
God said: Let the water below heaven be gathered together into one gathering, and let dry
land appear; and it was so. And the water below heaven was gathered together into their
gatherings, and the dry land appeared. And God called the dry land Earth, and the
accumulations of the waters he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. And God said:
Let the earth sprout herb of grass, sowing seed according to its kind and according to its
likeness, and fruiting tree making fruit, whose seed is in it according to its kind upon
the earth; and it was so. And the earth brought forth herb of grass, sowing seed according
to its kind and according to its likeness, and fruiting tree making fruit, whose seed was
in it according to its kind upon the earth, and God saw that it was good. And there was

<p>Be enlightened, be enlightened, Jerusalem, for your light has come and the glory of the
Lord has dawned upon you. See, darkness will cover the earth as thick darkness upon
nations; but upon you will the Lord manifest himself, and his glory will appear upon you.
And kings will walk in your light and nations in your splendour. Like up your eyes around
and see your children gathered; see, all your sons have come from afar, and your daughters
will be raised on men&#146;s shoulders. Then you will see, and fear and be amazed in your
heart, because wealth of sea and of nations and of peoples will transfer to you; and herds
of camels will come to you and camels of Madiam and Gaipha will cover you; all they from
Saba will come, bringing gold and they will bear incense and precious stone and they will
declare the good tidings of the salvation of the Lord. And all the sheep of Kedar will be
gathered to you and the rams of Nabaioth will come to you, and there will be offered
acceptable sacrifices on my altar, and my house of prayer will be glorified. Who are these
who fly like clouds and as doves with their nestlings? The isles awaited me and in the
first place the ships of Tharsis to bring your children from afar and their silver and
gold with them for the sake of the holy name of the Lord and for the sake of the glorious
Holy One of Israel. And strangers will build your walls and their kings will stand before
you; for because of my wrath I smote you and because of mercy I loved you. And your gates
will be open continually, night and day they will not be shut, to bring to you the power
of the nations and their kings as captives; for the nations and kings who will not serve
you will perish and the nations will be made a desert in the desert places. And the glory
of Libanus will come to you with cypress and pine and cedar together, to glorify my holy
place and I shall glorify the place of my feet. And the sons of those who humbled you and
of those who embittered you will come to you afraid, and you will be called City of the
Lord, Sion of the Holy One of Israel. Because of your being abandoned and hated, and there
was no one to help you, I will give you eternal joy, gladness for generations of
generations; and you will suck the milk of nations and eat the wealth of kings; and you
will know that it is I the Lord who save you and I the God of Israel who deliver you.</font></p>

to the whole congregation of the of the children of Israel saying: On the tenth of this
month let each take a sheep according to the houses of their families; if they should be

neighbour according to the number of souls; each shall be numbered for him according the
sufficiency for a sheep; it shall be for you a sheep, perfect, male, a yearling; you shall

to Joppa and found a boat bound for Tharsis, and he paid the fare, and boarded it, to sail
with them to Tharsis from the face of the Lord. And the Lord raised a great wind on the
sea; and there came a great storm on the sea, and the boat was in danger of breaking up.
And the sailors were afraid and each cried to his god, and they threw the cargoes that
were in the boat into the sea to lighten it of them. But Jonas had gone down into the hold
of the boat and was sleeping and snoring. And the captain approached him and said to him:
Why are you snoring? Arise, and call on your God, perhaps God will save us, and we may not
perish. And each one said to his neighbour: Come, let us cast lots, and let us find out
for what reason this evil is upon us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonas. And
they said to him: Tell us for what reason this evil is upon us. What is your work? Where
have you come from? And where are you going? And from what country and from people are
you? And he said to them: I am a servant of the Lord, and I worship the Lord, the God of
heaven, who made the sea and the dry land. And the men feared with a great fear, and they
said to him: Why did you do this? Because the men knew that he was fleeing from the face
of the Lord, because he had told them; and they said to him: What are we to do with you,
and so the sea will become calm for us? Because the sea was rising and raising an even
greater storm. And Jonas said to them: Take me, and throw me into the sea, and the sea
will become calm for you; because I know that it is because of me that this great storm is
upon you. And the men were striving to return to land, and they could not, because the sea
rose ever higher against them. And they cried out to the Lord and said: Let it not be,
Lord; let us not perish because of the soul of this person, and do not bring on us just
blood; because you, Lord, have done as you wished. And they took Jonas and threw him into
the sea and the sea ceased from its raging. And the men feared the Lord with a great fear,
and they sacrificed a sacrifice to the Lord, and they vowed vows. And the Lord had ordered
a great whale to swallow down Jonas; and Jonas was in the belly of the whale for three
days and three nights. And Jonas prayed to the Lord his God and said: I cried to the Lord
my God in my trouble: and he heard me; from the bowels of hell my cry; you heard my voice.
You cast me into the depths of the heart of the sea: and rivers surrounded me. All your
billows and your waves passed over me. And I said: I have been thrust from your eyes;
shall I look again towards your holy temple. Water encompassed me, even to my soul: the
final deep closed round me. My head went down to the clefts of the mountains. I descended
into the earth, whose bars are eternal barriers. Let my life come up from corruption to
you, O Lord my God. As my soul was departing from me I remembered the Lord; and let my
prayer come to you, to your holy temple. Those who preserve vain and foolish things have
forsaken their own Mercy. But I shall sacrifice to you with a voice of praise and
confession; I will pay you. O Lord, whatever I have vowed, for my salvation. And the Lord
ordered the whale; and it cast Jonas out upon the dry land. And the word of the Lord came
to Jonas a second time, saying: Arise and journey to Nineve the great city, and preach in
it in accordance with the previous word which I spoke to you. And Jonas arose and
journeyed to Nineve, as the Lord had told him. Now Nineve was a great city to God, of
about three days journey. And Jonas began to journey into the city, about one day&#146;s
journey, and he preached and said: Still three days and Nineve will be overthrown. And the
men of Nineve believed God and proclaimed a fast, and dressed in sackcloth from the
greatest of them to the least. And the word reached the king of Nineve, and he rose from
his throne, and took off his robe, and out on sackcloth, and sat on ashes. And there was a
proclamation and a declaration in Nineve from the king and from his nobles, saying: Humans
and beasts, oxen and sheep are not to eat, not to pasture and not to drink water. So
humans and beasts put on sackcloth and cried out insistently to God; and they turned away
each from their wicked way and from the injustice in their hands, saying: Who knows if God
will repent and be entreated and turn back from the anger of his rage, and we may not
perish? And God saw their works, that they had turned from their wicked ways, and God
repented of the evil which he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it. And
Jonas was very deeply grieved, and he was troubled, and he prayed to the Lord and said:
Were not these my words when I was still in my land? Because of this I made haste to
escape to Tharsis, because I knew that you are merciful, and pitying and long-suffering
and full of mercy, and repent over evils. And now, Master, Lord, take my soul from me, for
it is better for me to die than to live. And the Lord said to Jonas: Are you then so very
grieved? And Jonas left the city, and sat down opposite the city, and made a tent for
himself, and sat under it in the shade, until he should see what would happen to the city.
And God gave orders to a gourd, and it came up over Jonas head, to be a shade for him
above his head, to shade him from his troubles; and Jonas rejoiced with great joy at the
gourd. And God gave orders to a worm at dawn on the morrow, and it smote the gourd and it
withered up. And it came to pass that as soon as the sun had dawned that God gave orders
to a burning east wind; and the sun beat down on Jonas&#146; head; and he fainted and
despaired of his soul, and said: It were better for me to die than live. And God said to
Jonas: Are you then so very grieved over the gourd? And he said: I am very grieved, even
to death. And the Lord said: You had pity for the gourd, for which you had suffered no
evil, nor did you rear it; it came into being before night, and perished before night. And
I, shall I not have pity for Nineve the great city, in which dwell more than one hundred
and twenty thousand people, who do not know their right hand or their left, and many
animals.</font></p>

<p>The children of Israel encamped in Galgala and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day
of the first month in the evening, to the west of Jericho, on the far side of the Jordan
in the plain. And they ate of the corn of the land on the morrow of Passover, unleavened
and new. On this day the manna ceased, after they had eaten of the corn of the land, and
there was no longer manna for the children of Israel; they harvested the country of the
Phoenicians in that year. And it came to pass when Jesus was in Jericho that he looked up
with his eyes and saw someone standing in front of him, and a drawn sword was in his hand;
and Jesus approached him and said to him: Are you ours, or of the enemies? But he said to
him: I, the Chief Captain of the power of the Lord, have now come. And Jesus fell on his
face to the ground, and worshipped, and said to him: Master, what order do you give your
servant? And the Lord&#146;s Chief Captain said to Jesus: Untie your sandal from your
feet; for the place on which you are standing is holy. And Jesus did so.</font></p>

<p>The children of Israel departed from Sokchoth and encamped at Othom by the desert. God
was leading them by day with a pillar of cloud to show them the way, but by night with a
pillar of fire. The pillar of cloud did not fail to appear to them by day, and the pillar
of fire by night before all the people. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Speak to the
children of Israel, and let them turn away and encamp opposite the settlement between
Magdol and the sea, opposite Beëlsephôn; before them you will camp by the sea. And
Pharao will say to his people: These children of Israel are wandering in the land; for the
desert has shut them in. But I will harden Pharao&#146;s heart, and he will pursue after
them; and I shall be glorified in Pharao and in all his army; and the Egyptians will know
that I am the Lord; and the did this. And it was reported to the king of the Egyptians
that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharao and his servants was changed against the
people, and they said: Why did we do this&#151;to send the children of Israel away so as
not to slave for us? So Pharao yoked his chariots and assembled all his people with
himself, and took six hundred chosen chariots and all the cavalry of the Egyptians, and
the captains over them all. And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao, king of Egypt, and
he went in pursuit after the children of Israel; but the children of Israel marched out
with upraised hand. And the Egyptians went in pursuit after them and found them encamped
by the sea. And all the cavalry and chariots of Pharao, and the horsemen and his army were
opposite the settlement in front of Beësepphôn; and Pharao approached. And the children
looked up with their eyes and they saw, and lo, the Egyptians were encamped behind them,
and they were greatly afraid; but the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, and said
to Moses: Because there were no graves in Egypt have you brought us out to die in the
desert? What have you done this, leading us out of Egypt? Is not this the word which we
spoke to you when we said: Leave us alone that we may be slaves of the Egyptians? For it
is better for us to be slaves to the Egyptians than to die in this desert. But Moses said
to the people: Take courage, stand firm, and see the salvation which comes from the Lord,
which he will perform for us to-day. For the way in which you have seen the Egyptians
to-day, you will not see them again for ever. The Lord will fight for you, and you will
keep silent. But the Lord said to Moses: Why do you cry out to me? Speak to the children
of Israel, and them yoke up again; and you, lift up your staff and stretch out hand upon
the sea, and divide it; and let the children of Israel enter the midst of the sea on dry
ground. And see, I shall harden Pharao&#146;s heart, and that of all the Egyptians, and
they will enter after them; and I shall be glorified in Pharao and in all his army, and in
his chariots and in his horses; and all the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord, when I
am glorified in Pharao and in his chariots and in his horses. And the Angel of God, who
marched before the camp of the children of Israel, removed and marched at their rear;
while the pillar of cloud also removed from in front of them and stood in their rear. And
it entered between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of the children of Israel, and
stopped; and there was darkness and gloom; and the night passed and they did not come near
one another the whole night. But Moses stretched out his hand upon the sea; and the Lord
drove the sea with a strong south wind the whole night long, and made the sea dry; and the
water was parted. And the children of Israel entered the midst of the sea on dry land; and
its water was a wall on the right and a wall on the left. But the Egyptians went in
pursuit and entered after them, and all the cavalry of Pharao, and the chariots and the
riders into the midst of the sea. But it came to pass at the dawn watch that the Lord
looked upon the camp of the Egyptians in a pillar of fire and cloud, and he troubled the
camp of the Egyptians; and bound the axles of their chariots, and made them go with
difficulty. And the Egyptians said: Let us fly from before Israel; for the Lord is
fighting the Egyptians for them. But the Lord said to Moses: Stretch out your hand upon
the sea and let the water be restored and let it cover the Egyptians, the chariots and the
riders. But Moses stretched out his hand upon the sea, and the water was restored towards
day to its place; but the Egyptians fled under the water; and the Lord shook off the
Egyptians into the midst of the sea; and the water came back, it covered the chariots and
the riders and all the power of Pharao, those who entered after them into the sea, and
there was not one of them left behind. But the children of Israel marched through dry land
in the midst of the sea; while the water was a wall for them on the right and on the left.
And the Lord delivered Israel on that day from the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw
the Egyptians dead by the shore of the sea. While Israel saw the mighty hand, what the
Lord had done to the Egyptians; and the people feared the Lord and believed God and Moses
his servant. Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the Lord, and said:
Let us sing to the Lord, for he is greatly glorified: horse and rider he has cast into the
sea. Helper and protector he has become for my salvation: he is my God and I will glorify
him; my father&#146;s God and I will exalt him. The Lord shatters wars, the Lord is his
name. Pharao&#146;s chariots and power he has cast into the sea; his chosen mounted
captains he has drowned in the Red Sea. With the deep he covered them: they sank to the
bottom like a stone. Your right hand, Lord, has been glorified with strength; your right
hand, Lord, has crushed enemies; and by the multitude of your glory you have smashed the
opponents. You sent forth your anger, it consumed them like a reed. And through the spirit
of your wrath the water parted; the waters became fixed like a wall, and the waves became
fixed in the midst of the sea. The enemy said: I will pursue, I will overtake, I will
divide the spoil, I will fill my soul, I will destroy with my sword, my right hand shall
lord it. You sent forth your spirit, the sea covered them, they sank like lead in a mass
of water. Who is like you among the gods, Lord? Who is like you? Glorified in holiness,
wondrous in glories, performing marvels. You stretched out your right hand, the earth
swallowed them down. You guided with justice this people of yours, which you have
redeemed; by your strength you have called them into your holy resting-place. Nations
heard and were enraged; pangs have seized the inhabitants of Philistiïm. Then the leaders
of Edom and the rulers of the Moabites hastened: trembling took hold of them: all the
inhabitants of Canaan melted away. Let fear and trembling fall upon them: by the greatness
of your arm let them be turned to stone; till your people pass over, O Lord: till your
people, whom you have gained, pass over. Bring them and plant them on the mountain of your
inheritance, your prepared dwelling, which you have made, Lord: the sanctuary which your
hands have prepared. The Lord reigns over the ages and for ever and ever: for
Pharaoh&#146;s horse went with the chariots and horsemen into the sea, and the Lord
brought the water of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in
the midst of the sea.</font></p>

<p>The word of the Lord came to Elias saying: Rise, and journey to Sarepta in Sidonia;
see, I have commanded a widow there to look after you. And he rose and journeyed to
Sarepta and came to the gate of the city; and see, there was a widow gathering sticks. And
Elias called after her and said to her: Fetch me, please, a little water in a vessel and I
shall drink. And she went to fetch it, and Elias called after her: Fetch me, please, a
morsel of bread too in your hand. And the woman said: As the Lord your God lives, I have
not so much as a cake, but only a handful of flour in a pitcher and a little oil in a
flask; and see, I am gathering a couple of twigs and I shall go in and prepare it for
myself and my children, and we will eat it and die. And Elias said to her: Take courage,
go in and do as you have said; but make me from it a little cake, and you shall bring it
to me first and then you shall make for yourself and your children last. Because thus says
the Lord: The pitcher of flour will not run out and the flask of oil not diminish until
the day when the Lord gives rain upon the land. And the woman went and did so; and she ate
and he and her children. And from that day the pitcher of flour did not run out and the
flask of oil did not diminish according to the word of the Lord, which he had spoken
through the hand of Elias. And it came to pass after this that the son of the woman, the
mistress of the house, fell sick, and his sickness was very severe, until there was no
spirit left in him. And she said to Elias: Why do you trouble me, man of God? Have you
come here to remind me of my injustice and to kill my son? And Elias said to the woman:
Give me your son; and he took him from her bosom and carried him to the upper chamber, in
which he was lodging, and laid him to sleep on the bed. And Elias cried out to the Lord
and said: Alas, Lord, the witness of the widow with whom I dwell, you have done evil in
killing her son. And he breathed on the child three times and called on the Lord and said:
Lord my God, Let the soul of this child return to it. And it came to pass that the child
cried out; and he brought him down from the upper chamber into the house and gave him to
his mother. And Elias said: Look, your son lives. And the woman said to Elias: See, I know
that you are a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is true.</font></p>

<p>It came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham and said to him: Abraham,
Abraham; but he said: Here am I. And he said: Take your son, your beloved, whom you love,
Isaac, and journey to the high land and offer him there as a whole burnt offering on one
of the mountains, which I shall tell you. In the morning Abraham arose, saddled his ass;
while he took with him two servants and Isaac his son, and having split wood for the
holocaust he arose and journeyed and came to the place which God had told him on the third
day. And looking up with his eyes Abraham saw the place from afar. And Abraham said to his
servants: Stay here with the ass, while I and the child cross over as far as there and
when we have worshipped we shall return to you. Abraham took the wood for the holocaust
and placed it on Isaac his son; while he took in his hand both the fire and the knife, and
they journeyed the two of them together. Isaac said to Abraham his father: Father. He
said: What is it, child? He said: See, the fire and the wood; where is the sheep for the
holocaust? Abraham said: God will see for himself to a sheep for the holocaust, child.
Both of them journeyed together and they came to the place, which God had told him; and
there Abraham built and altar and placed the wood on it and binding Isaac his son he
placed him on the altar on top of the wood. And Abraham stretched out his hand to take the
knife to slay his son. And the Angel of the Lord called him from Heaven and said to him:
Abraham, Abraham. But he said: Here I am. And he said: Do not lay you hand on the child,
nor do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God and have not spared your beloved
son for my sake. And looking up with his eyes Abraham saw, and lo a ram caught in a Sabek
plant by the horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered it as a holocaust
instead of Isaac his son. And god called the name of the place: The Lord saw; as they say
to this day: On the mountain the Lord was seen. And the Angel of the Lord called Abraham a
second time from Heaven saying: By myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have
done this thing, and have not spared your beloved son for my sake, therefore blessing I
will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of Heaven and as
the sand which is on the shore of the sea, and your seed will inherit the cities of their

<p>There came a day an Elissaios crossed to Soman, and there an important woman
constrained him to take food; and it came to pass that as often as he went there he turned
aside to eat there. And the woman said to her husband: See, I know that this man, who
comes through to us continually, is a holy man of God; so let us make for him a little
upstairs room and put a bed and a table and stool and a lamp in it; and it shall be that
when he comes to us he will turn aside there. And a day came and he entered there and
turned aside to the upstairs room and slept there. And he said to his boy Giëzi: Call the
Sunamite woman to me. And he called her, and she stood before him. And he said to him: Say
to her then: You have shown this amazing trouble for us. What must we do for you? Have you
some request to the King or to the captain of the host? But she said: I dwell in the midst
of my people. And he said to Giëzi: What must we do for her? And his boy Giëzi said:
Indeed she has no son, and her husband is an old man. And he called her, and she stood by
the door. And Elissaios said to her: At this moment, when the season is, you, alive, will
embrace a son. But she said: No, my Lord, do not lie to your servant. And the woman
conceived in the womb and gave birth to a son at that time, as the season was, alive, as
Elissaios had to her. And the boy grew; and it came to pass, when he went out to his
father to the reapers, that he said to his father: My head, my head. And he said to the
servant boy: Take him to his mother. And he took him to his mother, and he slept on her
knees until midday and he died. And she took him and laid him on the bed of the man of
God, and shut the door on him and went out. And she called her husband and said: Send me
one of the boys and one of the she asses, and I will hurry to the man of God and then
return. And he said to her: Why are you going to him to-day? It is not new moon or
Sabbath. But she said: Peace. And she saddled the she ass and said to her boy: Now, go,
and do not hesitate because of me to ride, unless I tell you. Come, journey and go as far
as the man of God on Mount Carmel. And she went and journeyed as far as the man of God on
the mountain. And it came to pass that Elissaios saw her coming, and said to his boy
Giëzi: Look, that Sunamite woman; now run to meet her, and you are to say: Is it peace?
Is it peace for your husband? Is it peace for the boy? But she said: Peace. And she came
to Elissaios on the mountain and seized his feet, and Giëzi approached to push her away.
And Elissaios said: Let her alone, because her soul is greatly grieved, and the Lord has
hidden it from me and not told me. But she said: Did I ask a son of my lord? For did I not
say: Do not lie to me. And Elissaios said to Giëzi: Gird yourself and take my staff in
your hand and go. If you meet a man, you are not to bless him, and if a man blesses you,
you are not to answer him. And you are to lay my staff on the face of the boy. And the
boy&#146;s mother said: As the Lord lives and as your soul lives, I shall not leave you.
And Elissaios arose and went behind her. And Giëzi went on ahead of her and placed the
staff on the boy&#146;s face, and there was no sound nor any hearing. And he returned to
meet him and gave him the news, saying: The boy has not been raised. And Elissaios entered
the house; and lo, the boy was lying dead on his bed. And Elissaios entered the house and
shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the Lord. And he climbed up and lay on the
boy and put his mouth to his mouth and his eyes to his eyes and his hands to his hands,
and he bowed himself upon him, and the boy&#146;s flesh grew warm. And he returned and
walked in the house, up and down, and went up and bowed over the boy seven times; and the
boy opened his eyes. And Elissaios shouted to Giëzi and said: Call this Sunamite woman to
me; and he called her, and she came to him. And Elissaios said to her: Take your son. And
the woman came and fell at his feet and worshipped to the ground; and she took her son and
went out.</font></p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: Where is he who brought the shepherd of the sheep out of the earth?
Where is he who put the Holy Spirit in them? Who led Moses by his right hand, the arm of
his glory? He overpowered the water in front of him, to make for himself an eternal name.
He led them through the deep like a horse through the desert, and they did not grow weary,
like cattle through a plain; a spirit came down from the Lord and guided them; thus you
led out your people to make for yourself a name of glory. Turn from heaven and look from
your holy house and from your glory: where is your zeal and your strength? Where is the
multitude of your mercy and your pities, because you have held back from us? You are our
Father, because Abraham did not know us, and Israel did not acknowledge us, but you, Lord
our Father, deliver us; from the beginning your name is upon us. Why have you made us
wander from your way, Lord? Why have your hardened our heart not to fear you? Turn back
for your servants&#146; sake, for the tribes of your inheritance, that we may inherit a
little of your holy mountain. Our opponents have trampled down your sanctuary. We have
become as from the beginning, when you did not rule us, when your name had not been
invoked upon us. [<i>64:1</i>] If you open heaven, trembling will take hold on the
mountains from you, and they will melt, as wax melts before the face of fire, and fire
will burn up the opponents and your name will be manifest among the opponents; at your
presence nations will be troubled; trembling from you will take hold of mountains. From of
old we have not heard, our eyes have not seen a God but you, and the works which you will
do for those who await your mercy. For they will meet with those who do what is just and
who will remember your ways.</font></p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: Lo, days are coming and I shall make a covenant with the house of
Israel, and a new covenant with the house of Juda, not according to the covenant which I
made with their fathers, on the day when I took their hand to lead them out of the land of
Egypt, because they did not abide by my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.
Because this is my covenant, which I will make with the house of Israel after those days,
says the Lord, I will surely give my laws into their minds and I shall write them on their
hearts, and I shall be for them as God, and they shall be for me a people. And they will
not teach each his fellow citizen, and each his brother, saying: Know the Lord; because
they will all know me, from the smallest among them to the greatest, because I shall be
merciful to their iniquities, and I shall not remember their sins any more.</font></p>

[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">3:1-88</font>]</p>

<p>In the eighteenth year Nabuchodonosor made a golden image; its height was sixty cubits
and its breadth was six cubits; and he set it up in the plain of Deïra, in the country of
Babylon. And he sent to gather all the governors and generals and magistrates and chiefs
and princes, all those with authority, all the governors of countries to come to the
dedication of the image. And they were gathered, the magistrates, governors, generals,
chiefs, great princes, those with authority, all the governors of countries for the
dedication of the image which Nabuchodonosor the king had set up; and they stood before
the image. And the herald cried loudly: To you it is ordered, peoples, tribes, languages,
at what hour you shall hear the sound of trumpet, pipe, harp, sackbut, psaltery and every
kind of music, you shall fall down and worship the golden image which Nabuchodonosor the
king has set up. And any one who does not fall down and worship, at that hour shall be
cast into the burning furnace of fire. And it came to pass that when the people heard the
sound of trumpet, pipe, harp, sackbut, psaltery and every kind of music, all the peoples,
tribes and languages fell down and worshipped the golden image which Nabuchodonosor had
set up. Then certain Chaldean men approached and accused the Jews and they spoke and said
to king Nabuchodonosor: O king, live for ever! You, O king, have given an order that
everyone who hears the sound of trumpet, pipe, harp, sackbut, psaltery and every kind of
music and does not fall down and worship the golden image, shall be cast into the burning
furnace of fire. There are Jewish men, whom you have placed over the works of the country
of Babylon, Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago, who have not obeyed your order, O king, and do
not serve your gods and who do not worship the golden image which you have set up. Then in
rage and anger Nabuchodonosor ordered Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago to be brought; and they
were brought before the king; and Nabuchodonosor answered and said to them: Is it true,
Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago that you do not serve my gods, and do not worship the golden
image that I have set up? Now therefore, when you hear the sound of trumpet, pipe, harp,
sackbut, psaltery and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden
image that I have set up; and if you do not worship, in that hour you will be cast into
the burning furnace of fire. And who is the god that will rescue you from my hands?
Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago answered king Nabuchodonosor: We have no need to answer you
over this matter; for our God, whom we serve, is in heaven, able to rescue us from the
burning furnace of fire and he will from your hands, O king, because we will not serve
your gods and we will not worship the golden image that you have set up. Then
Nabuchodonosor was filled with rage, and his countenance was changed towards Sedrach,
Misach and Abdenago, and he ordered the furnace to be heated sevenfold, so that it should
burn to the uttermost; and he ordered his strongest men to fetter Sedrach, Misach and
Abdenago and to cast them into the burning furnace of fire. Then the man bound then with
their coats, caps, leggings and other clothing and they were cast into the middle of the
burning fiery furnace, since the word of the king was pressing; and the furnace was heated
exceedingly, sevenfold. And these three, Sedrach, Misach and Abdenago, fell bound into the
midst of the burning furnace of fire, and they walked in the middle of the flame, praising
god and blessing the Lord. And Azarias prayed thus; and opening his mouth in the middle of
the fire he said: Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers: and praised and
glorified is your name to the ages. For you are just in all that you have done for us. And
all your works are true, and your ways are right, and all your judgements are true. And
judgements of truth you have executed in all that you have brought upon us. And upon
Jerusalem the holy city of our fathers. Because in truth you have brought all these things
upon us, because of our sins. Because we have sinned and committed iniquity in departing
from you, and we have sinned in all things, and we have not obeyed your commandments, nor
kept them, nor have we done as you commanded us, that it might be well with us. And all
that you have done to us, and all that you have brought upon us, you have done with true
judgement; and you handed us over into the hands of our lawless foes, hateful rebels, and
to an unjust king, the most wicked in all the earth. And now we cannot open our mouth; we
have become a shame and disgrace to your servants, and to those who honour you. Do not
hand us over for ever, for your holy name&#146;s sake, and do not annul your covenant, and
do not withdraw your mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham your beloved, and Isaac your
servant, and Israel your holy one. To whom you said that you would multiply their seed as
the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the shore of the sea. Because, Master, we
have become smaller than all the nations, and we are humbled in all the earth to-day
because of our sins. And at this moment there is neither prince, nor prophet nor leader;
neither holocaust, nor sacrifice, not offering, nor incense; no place to make an offering
before you and to find mercy. Yet with a contrite heart and with a spirit of humility may
we be accepted, as though with holocausts of rams and bulls and tens of thousands of fat
lambs, so may our sacrifice be acceptable before you to-day, and may it be perfected
behind you; because there is no shame for those who trust in you. And now we are following
you with our whole heart, and we fear you, and seek your face; do not put us to shame. But
do with us according to your fairness, and according to the multitude of your mercy.
Deliver us according to your wondrous works, and give glory to your name, O Lord. And let
all who harm your servants be disgraced, and put to shame from all their power, and let
their strength be smashed. And let them know that you Lord, alone are God, and glorious in
the whole inhabited world. And the king&#146;s servants, who cast them in, did not cease
stoking the furnace with naphtha, pitch, tow and brushwood. And the flame poured out above
the furnace forty nine cubits; and it spread out and burnt up those of the Chaldeans it
found around the furnace. But the Angel of the Lord came down into the furnace with
Azarias and his companions, and shook the flame of the fire out of the furnace. And he
made the midst of the furnace as though a moist wind were whistling through it; and the
fire did not touch them at all, nor hurt them, nor trouble them. Then the Three as with
one voice, hymned, blessed and glorified God in the furnace, saying: Blessed are you, O
Lord, the God of our fathers: to be praised and exalted unto the ages. And blessed is your
glorious, holy name: to be praised and exalted unto the ages. Blessed are you in the
temple of your glory: to be praised and exalted unto the ages. Blessed are you who behold
the deeps and sit upon the Cherubim: to be praised and exalted unto the ages. Blessed are
you on the glorious throne of your kingdom: to be praised and exalted unto the ages.
Blessed are you in the firmament of heaven: to be praised and exalted unto the ages.</font></p>

<p>Brethren, as many of us as have been baptised into Christ, have been baptised into his
death. We have been buried then with him through baptism to death; so that, as Christ has
been raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may thus walk in newness
of life. For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his, we shall
certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was
crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and that we might no longer
be slaves of sin. For whoever has died has been justified from sin. But if we have died
with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. We know that Christ, being
raised from the dead, dies no more; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death
he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives he lives to God. So you must
also consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God, in Christ Jesus our Lord.</font></p>

<p>After the Sabbath, as it grew light on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen and the
other Mary came to see the tomb. And behold there was a great earthquake; for an Angel of
the Lord came down from heaven, approached and rolled away the stone from the door and sat
upon it. Hi appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow. From fear of him
those who were on guard were shaken with fear and became like dead men. The Angel answered
and said to the women, &#145;Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus the
crucified. He is not here. He has been raised from the dead. Come, see the place where the
Lord lay. And go quickly, tell his disciples that he has been raised from the dead and
see, he is going ahead of you into Galilee. It is there you will see him. See, I have told
you.&#146; And they went out quickly from the grave with fear and great and ran to
announce it to his disciples. As they were on their way to announce it to his disciples,
behold Jesus met them and said, &#145;Rejoice!&#146; But they approached, seized his feet
and worshipped him. Then Jesus said to them, &#145;Do not be afraid! Go and announce to my
disciples that they are to go into Galilee and they will see me there.&#146; As they were
going, some of the guard entered the city and announced to the chief priests all that had
taken place. They assembled with the elders and took counsel and then gave a large sum of
money to the soldiers, saying, &#145;Say, &quot;His disciples came by night and stole him
while we were asleep.&quot; And if this gets to the ears of the governor, we will satisfy
him and keep you unharmed.&#146; They took the money and did as they had been instructed.
And this report has been circulated among the Jews to this day. But the eleven disciples
went to Galilee, to the mountain that Jesus had ordered them. And when they saw they
worshipped him; but some doubted. And Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying,
&#145;All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go, therefore, and make
disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit; teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you. And
behold, I am with you all days, until the consummation of the age.&#146;</font></p>
