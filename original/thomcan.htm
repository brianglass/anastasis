<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" face="Book Antiqua" size="6">CANON FOR THE SUNDAY
OF ANTIPASCHA<br>
</font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5">THE HANDLING BY THE APOSTLE THOMAS</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4" color="#FF0000">Composition of John
the Monk.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 1. Tone 1. The
Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">All peoples let us sing a song of victory to him who
rescued Israel from the bitter slavery of Pharao, and guided them dryshod in the depths of
the sea, for he has been glorified.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">To-day is the spring of souls, for Christ, shining
from the tomb like the sun, has dispelled the foggy winter of our sin. Let us sing to him,
for he has been glorified.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The queen of seasons, filled with light, as escort
to the brilliant queen of days, delights the chosen people of the Church, which
unceasingly praises the risen Christ. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Neither death&#146;s gates, O Christ, nor the seals
of the tomb, nor the bolts of the doors stood in your way; but having risen you came to
your friends, O Master, giving them the peace which passes all understanding.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 3. The Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Establish me, O Christ, on the rock of your
commandments, and enlighten me with the light of your face; for none is holy but you, O
Lover of mankind.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">When by your Cross, O Christ, you had made us new
instead of old, instead of corruptible incorruptible, you commanded us to live worthily in
newness of life.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Though you had been locked in the tomb with your
finite flesh, O Christ, as infinite you arose; and when the doors were shut you came to
your Disciples, O All-powerful.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">By keeping your wounds, O Christ, which you had
borne willingly for our sakes, you gave your Disciples proof of your glorious
Resurrection.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 4. The Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Great is the mystery of your dispensation, O Christ!
And foreseeing this in a divine vision from above Avvakoum cried out to you: &#145;You
have come forth for the salvation of your people, O Lover of mankind.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">He tasted gall, healing the tasting of old; but now
with honeycomb Christ gives the Forefather a share in illumination and his sweet
participation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You rejoice as you are searched; because for this, O
Lover of mankind, you invited Thomas, offering your side to the disbelieving world,
confirming, O Christ, your Rising on the third day.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Twin, drawing wealth, O Benefactor, from the
inviolate treasure of your side pierced by the lance, has filled the whole world with
wisdom and knowledge.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Your all-blest tongue is hymned, O Twin, for, being
filled with grace from the touch, it was the first to devoutly proclaim Jesus the Giver of
life to be God and Lord.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 5. The Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Rising in the night we hymn you, O Christ, like the
Father without beginning and the Saviour of our souls. Grant peace to the world O Lover of
mankind.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Coming to his disheartened friends the Saviour by
his presence drives away all dejection and rouses them to leap for joy at his
Resurrection.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O truly laudable, dread enterprise of Thomas! For
boldly he handled the side which blazed with the divine fire.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You showed us that Thomas&#146; unbelief was mother
of belief, for in your wisdom you arrange all things for good, O Christ, as Lover of
mankind.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 6. The Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You saved the prophet from the whale, O Lover of
mankind, lead me up too, I pray, from the deep of offences.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You did not leave Thomas, Master, plunged in the
deep of unbelief when you stretched out your palms for investigation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Saviour said, &#145;Handle me and see that I
have bones and flesh. I am not altered.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Thomas, who was not present at your first entrance,
handled your side and believing acknowledged you.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 7. The Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">When the harmony of music summoned the peoples to
worship the image, the Children of David, singing the ancestral songs of Zion, broke the
ominous decree of the tyrant, and changed the flame to dew, as they sang the hymn, &#145;O
highly exalted, our God and the God of our fathers blessed are you&#146;.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">It is first and mistress of days, this
light-bringing day, on which it is fitting for God&#146;s new people to rejoice, for with
trembling it bears the type of the age to come, as it completes the Eight. O highly
exalted, our God and the God of our fathers. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Thomas the Twin, who alone was bold, and brought
blessing by his faithless faith, banished misty ignorance in all the ends of the earth by
his believing unbelief; while for himself he wove a crown as he wisely said, &#145;You are
our God, O highly exalted, our God and the God of our fathers; blessed are you&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Not in vain did Thomas doubt your Rising, not in
vain declare, but he hastened, O Christ, to show to all the nations that it was undoubted;
and so having through unbelief come to belief he taught them all to say, &#145;You are our
God, O highly exalted, our God and the God of our fathers; blessed are you&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Fearfully placing his hand, O Christ, in your
life-bearing side, trembling he felt the double force, O Saviour, of the two natures
united unconfusedly in you, and with faith he cried, &#145;You are our God, O highly
exalted, our God and the God of our fathers; blessed are you&#146;.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 8. The Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Lord who protected the Youths in the flame of
fire of the burning furnace, and came down to them in the form of an Angel, praise and
highly exalt to all the ages.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Longing for the joy of seeing you, at first Thomas
did not believe; but when found worthy of this sight he called you, Master, Lord and God,
whom we highly exalt to all the ages.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Lord who bore with Thomas&#146; unbelief, showed
him his side and was closely examined by his hand, praise and highly exalt to all the
ages.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Your curiosity, O Thomas, opened for us the hidden
treasure, for with a tongue inspired you declared him God and said &#145;Praise Christ and
highly exalt him to all the ages&#146;.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 9. The Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You, the shining lamp and Mother of God, the
manifest glory and higher than all creatures, in hymns we magnify.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Your shining and brilliant day, O Christ, the grace,
all light, in which, lovely in your beauty, you came to your Disciples, we magnify.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You whose side was handled by a hand of dust and did
not burn it with the fire of your divine and immaterial Being, in hymns we magnify.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You, O Christ, who arose from the tomb as God, we
who see not with our eyes, but who have believed with the longing of the heart, in hymns
we magnify.</font>
