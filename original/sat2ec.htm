<p>O the great mystery! As I contemplate the wonders I proclaim the Godhead, I do not deny
the humanity. For Emmanuel opened the gates of nature as he loves mankind, yet did not
break open the locks of virginity, but came forth from the womb as he had entered through
hearing. He became incarnate as he had been conceived. Impassibly he entered, ineffably he
came forth, in accordance with the saying of the Prophet, &#145;This gate will remain
shut; none may enter through it, but only the Lord God of Israel, he who has great
mercy&#146;.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Then</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> O Joyful Light&#133; </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">and the Prokeimenon </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The Lord is King&#133; </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">with its verses. After</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
Grant, Lord&#133; </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">etc., we sing
the first Resurrection Sticheron of the Aposticha and the following Prosomia of the Mother
of God.</p>

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>I shall remember your name in
every generation and generation.</p>

<p>Of all who are afflicted the joy, protector of the wronged, sustenance of those in
need, staff of the blind, visitation of the sick, shelter and assistance of the oppressed,
helper of orphans and Mother of God Most High are you, O All-pure. Hasten, we beseech you,
to deliver your servants.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Listen, daughter, and see, and incline
your ear; and forget your people and your father&#146;s house.</p>

<p>Every iniquity without restraint, every sin without limit, wretch that I am, I have
committed; of every condemnation I have become worthy. Grant me, O Virgin, means of
repentance, that I may appear there uncondemned. For I appoint you as my intercessor, I
call you in as my protector. Do not put me to shame, O Bride of God.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> The rich among the people of the land
will entreat your favour.</p>

<p>We have no other refuge to the Maker and Master but you, Pure Bride of God. With your
fervent protection do not cast us away; do not put us to shame who with love hasten under
your shelter.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Who will praise, who will call you blessed as is fitting, Maiden Bride of God, for the
redemption which through you has come to the world? Therefore with thanksgiving we cry to
you and say, &#145;Hail, who made Adam divine and brought together what was separated.
Hail, who enlightened our race by the light-bearing Resurrection of your Son and our God;
for we, the race of Christians, unceasingly magnify you.</p>

<p>Now Master&#133;, </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Trisagion

<p ALIGN="CENTER">And the Dismissal.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">AT GREAT VESPERS</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>After the Opening Psalm and the first Kathisma of the Psalter, at</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Lord I have cried</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">, we insert 10 Stichera, and we sing 7 Resurrection Stichera and 3 of the
Saint of the day, or as the Typikon directs.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Resurrection Stichera. Tone 2.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Come let us worship God the Word, begotten of the Father before the ages, incarnate of
the Virgin Mary; for having endured the Cross, he was handed over for burial, as he
himself wished, and having risen from the dead he saved me, mankind that had gone astray.</p>

<p>Christ our Saviour by nailing the record against us to the Cross annulled it, and
destroyed the might of death. We worship his Rising on the third day.</p>

<p>With Archangels let us sing the praise of the Resurrection of Christ; for he is the
Redeemer and the Saviour of our souls; and with dread glory and mighty power he is coming
again to judge the world which he fashioned.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Other Verses, by Anatolios. </font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>An Angel proclaimed you, the crucified and buried Master, and said to the women;
&#145;Come, see where the Lord was lying. For he has risen as he said, as
all-powerful&#146;. Therefore we worship you, the only immortal. O Christ, giver of life,
have mercy on us.</p>

<p>By your Cross you destroyed the curse of the tree; by your burial you slew the might of
death; by your Rising you enlightened the human race; therefore we cry out to you;
&#145;Benefactor, Christ our God, glory to you!&#146;</p>

<p>The gates of death opened to you Lord, in fear; Hades&#146; gate-keepers shuddered when
they saw you; for you smashed the gates of brass, crushed to powder the iron bars, led us
out of darkness and the shadow of death and tore our bonds asunder.</p>

<p>As we sing the hymn of salvation, let this song rise from our lips; &#145;Come all in
the Lord's house, let us fall down in worship as we say; &#145;You who were crucified on
the Tree, rose from the dead and are in the bosom of the Father, have mercy on our
sins!&#146;&#146;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory&#133;, Both now&#133;<i> </i></font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The shadow of the law has passed now that grace has come, for as the Bush in flames was
not consumed, so as a Virgin you bore a Child and remained a Virgin; instead of a pillar
of fire the Sun of righteousness has dawned, instead of Moses Christ, the salvation of our
souls<i>.</i></font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>After the Entrance and</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> O Joyful Light&#133;</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">, the designated Monk makes a metania to the
Superior and sings the Prokeimenon of the day.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Lord is King: * he has robed himself in majesty</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse 1:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> The Lord has robed and girded
himself with power.</font></p>

<p>Verse 2:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> He has made the world firm; it will
not be shaken.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Then the usual Litany,</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Grant Lord&#133; </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">etc. and after the Ekphonesis we sing the
idiomel Sticheron of the Saint of the Monastery as we process into the Narthex. After the
usual prayers we return to the Church singing the</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Resurrection Aposticha.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Your Resurrection, O Christ Saviour, has enlightened the whole inhabited world; and you
have called back your own creation. All-powerful Lord, glory to you!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">In Alphabetical Order.</p>

<p>Verse 1:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> The Lord is King: he has robed
himself in majesty. The Lord has robed and girded himself with power.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="5" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>D</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">estroying the curse of the tree through a
tree, O Saviour, you slew the might of death by your burial, while you enlightened our
race by your Rising; therefore we cry out to you; &#145;Giver of life, Christ our God,
glory to you!&#146;</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse 2:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>He has made the world firm;
it will not be shaken.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="5" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>E</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">ven as you appeared nailed to the Cross, O
Christ, you altered the beauty of created things; and while the soldiers showed their
inhumanity by piercing your side with a lance, the Hebrews asked that your tomb be sealed,
not understanding your power; but in your pitying compassion you accepted burial and rose
on the third day. Lord, glory to you!</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse 3:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Holiness befits your house, O Lord,
to length of days.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="5" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>F</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">or the sake of mortals, O Christ, Giver of
life, willingly you underwent the Passion; as Powerful you descended into Hell, snatched
as from the hand of a mighty one the souls of those who were waiting there for your coming
and instead of Hades you granted them to dwell in Paradise. And so to us who glorify your
Rising on the third day grant pardon of our sins and your great mercy.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.Both now. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>O new wonder, greater than all the wonders of old! For who has ever known of a Mother
who without a man has borne a child and carried in her arms the One who holds fast all
creation? The Child conceived is the Counsel of God, whom you, All-pure, carried in your
embrace and towards whom you have gained a mother's freedom to speak. Therefore do not
cease to intercede with him on behalf of those who honour you, that he take pity and save
our souls.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Apolytikion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>When you went down to death, O immortal Life, then you slew Hell with the lightning
flash of your Godhead; but when from the depths below the earth you raised the dead, all
the Powers in the heavens cried out, &#145;Giver of life, Christ our God, glory to
you!&#146;</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>All your mysteries are beyond understanding, all beyond glory, Mother of God; sealed in
purity and guarded in virginity you were known without deception to be a Mother, in giving
birth to the true God: implore him that our souls may be saved.</font>
