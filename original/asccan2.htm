<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="5" face="Book Antiqua">INTRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The current <i>Pentecostarion</i> gives St Joseph of
Thessaloniki as the author of this canon, but St Nikodemos in his commentary is emphatic
that the author is St Joseph the Hymnographer [</font><font size="4" face="SymbolGreek">Died
</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">886], whom he describes as the &#146;most
hymnographical of hymnographers&#146;. He writes, &#146;I mean Joseph, not the Bishop of
Thessaloniki, the brother of St Theodore the Studite, &#133; but Joseph who came from
Sicily and who honoured numerous Saints with the canons that are contained in the <i>Menaia</i>.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">St Joseph naturally uses many of the same biblical
texts as St John, but he also employs other texts, such as Psalm 46, <i>God has gone up
with a shout of joy, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet</i>, and Isaias 45,8 <i>Let
Heaven on high be glad, and let the clouds rain justice</i>, and 63,1, <i>Who is this who
comes from Edom, the red of his garments from Bosor?</i> In the Aposticha of Vespers,
where the same text is used, the name Bosor is taken to mean &#146;flesh&#146;, an
interesting, if mistaken, piece of Hebrew etymology, and the same is implied in Ode 6 of
this canon.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">I have not attempted to reproduce either of the
acrostics.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="5" face="Book Antiqua"><strong>CANON FOR THE
FEAST OF THE ASSUMPTION</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Acrostic is the
alphabet,<br>
but in the 8th and 9th Odes:</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><br>
JOSEPH&#146;S ODE.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 1. Tone 4. I will
open my mouth.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Immortal by nature, you arose on the third day and
appeared to the Eleven and to all the Disciples, and riding on a cloud you hastened back
to the Father, O Christ, Maker of the universe.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">David, inspired by God, in his song cried out most
plainly, &#146;The Lord has gone up to the heavenly places with a shout of joy and the
blast of the trumpet, and come to the Father, source of light&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">When by your passion and your rising, Lord, you had
made new a world grown old through many sins, you ascended, riding on a cloud, to the
heavenly places. Glory to your glory!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">All-spotless Lady, you bore the Master of all, who
accepted the voluntary passion and has gone back to his own Father; whom he had not left,
even though he had taken flesh.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 3. O Mother of
God.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Lift up the heavenly gates, for see, Christ the King
and Lord, wearing his earthly body, is at hand, said the powers below to those above.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">When you had sought out Adam, who had been led
astray by the deceit of the serpent, O Christ, as you had clothed yourself in him, you
ascended and took your seat as equal sovereign on the Father&#146;s right hand, while the
Angels sang your praise.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The earth keeps festival and dances, and heaven
rejoices at the Assumption today of the maker of creation, who by his will has clearly
united things which were separated.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">All-pure Virgin mother, who gave birth to the
Destroyer of death, the only immortal God, ever implore him to slay the passions which
have put me to death and save me.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 4. The One seated
in glory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Jesus the Giver of life, taking those he loved,
ascended the mount of Olives and blessed them and, riding on a cloud, he came to the
Father&#146;s bosom, which he had never left.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The whole world, visible and invisible, keeps the
feast with gladness; Angels and humans leap for joy as they glorify without ceasing the
Assumption of the One who by his goodness was united to us in the flesh.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Having abolished the might of death as immortal
Lord, you granted immortality to all, O Lover of humankind, and you were taken up in
glory, as your revered Disciples watched you, Jesu all-powerful.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Blessed has your womb become, All-blameless Lady,
for you were found worthy to contain beyond explanation the One who marvellously emptied
the belly of Hell. Implore him to save us who sing your praise.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 5. The universe
was amazed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">When you had slain death by your death, Lord, you
took those whom you loved and ascended the holy mount of Olives, and from there you
hastened back to your Begetter, O Christ, riding on a cloud.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Strange was your Birth, strange your Resurrection,
strange and fearful your divine Assumption from the mount, O Giver of life, of which Elias
was an icon when he went up in a four-horse chariot, singing your praise, O Lover of
mankind.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Angels spoke to the Apostles as they watched: Men of
Galilee, why are you amazed at the Assumption of Christ the Giver of life? He will come
again to earth to judge the whole world, as most just Judge.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Christ, who kept you Virgin after your giving birth
without corruption, Mother of God, ascends to the Father, whom he never left, even though
he took from you flesh with both mind and soul through his ineffable mercy.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 6. Come
godly-minded people.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Let the clouds rain down for us eternal gladness
from above; for Christ, riding on a cloud as on the Cherubim, today ascends to his Father.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Appearing in the likeness of flesh, you brought
together in one things that were formerly separated, O Lover of humankind; and as your
Disciples watched you, O Merciful, you were taken up to the heavenly places.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Why are the garments red of the One who was united
to the solidity of flesh? said the holy Angels, as they saw Christ bearing the divine
marks of his precious passion.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Pure Maiden, we hymn your conceiving, we hymn your
ineffable giving birth, through which we have been delivered from the destruction, the
wickedness and the gloomy incarceration of Hell.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 7. The godlike
Youths did not worship.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">A cloud of light received you, Lord, who are light,
as you were being taken up beyond understanding from earth; and heavenly multitudes with
the Apostles praised you, saying: O God, blessed are you.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Let us all gladly clap our hands at Christ&#146;s
Assumption, and let us shout with joy: The Lord has gone up with the sound of the trumpet
and, as equal in majesty with the Father, taken his seat on his right hand to the ages.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Great Moses of old chanted and cried out: Let the
Angels of heaven worship Christ as he ascends as King of all. To him we cry: Lord and God
of our Fathers, blessed are you.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O marvellous wonders! How did you, O full of
God&#146;s grace, contain the uncontainable God, who made himself poor according to the
flesh, and today with great glory has been taken up to heavenly places and given life to
humankind.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 8. The Offspring
of the Mother of God</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Intelligences appeared to the Apostles at the
Assumption and said: Why do you stand gazing and amazed? He who is ascending into heaven
will also come again to judge mankind on earth, for he alone is judge.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Let us give majesty to God; let us cry aloud with
one accord; let us sing; let us dance and let us clap our hands. Our God has gone up from
earth to heaven, as Angels and Archangels sing his praise as Master and Maker of all
things.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Our nature, which of old had fallen, has been raised
above the Angels and beyond understanding established on God&#146;s throne. Come, let us
keep festival and let us cry out: You his works, praise the Lord, and highly exalt him to
all the ages.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">See, Mother of God, your Son, having despoiled death
by his Cross, rose on the third day, and having shown himself to his Disciples he has
hastened to the heavenly places; as we worship you with him, we give praise and glory to
all the ages.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 9. Let all born
of earth.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Megalynarion:</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> Angels, seeing the ascent of the Master, were amazed at how
he was raised with glory from earth to things above.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O gifts beyond understanding! O dread mystery! For
the Master of all things, rising from earth to heaven, sent to his Disciples the Holy
Spirit, who enlightened their minds and set them afire with grace.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Megalynarion: </font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Angels, seeing the ascent of the Master, were amazed at how he was
raised with glory from earth to things above.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">To the band of Disciples the Lord said: Stay in
Jerusalem, and I shall send you another Advocate, equal in majesty with the Father, and
equal in honour with me, whom you see being taken up and riding upon a cloud of light.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Megalynarion: </font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Angels, seeing the ascent of the Master, were amazed at how he was
raised with glory from earth to things above.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The majesty of him who became poor in the flesh has
been raised above the heavens and our fallen nature honoured by sitting with the Father.
Let us keep festival and all cry aloud with one accord, and gladly clap our hands.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Light which shone from Light dawned from you,
dispelled all the blackness of atheism and led to the light those who slept in night; and
so, as is fitting, to the ages we ever call you blessed.</font>
