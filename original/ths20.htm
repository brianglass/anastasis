<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4" color="#FF0000">That we must preserve
the beauty and untarnished loveliness of the soul, and about repentance.</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Brethren and fathers, since we have been counted
worthy to celebrate the forefeast of the divine Transfiguration, from this then let us
compose an instruction, discharging our duty in a few words. On the one hand, all the
feasts of the Lord expound the mysteries of his sojourn in the flesh, such as that he was
born, that he was baptized, that he was crucified, that he was buried, that he was raised
on the third day, that he was taken up in glory; while the mystery of the Transfiguration
hints at the restoration in the age to come. For in the same way that &#145;his face
blazed like the sun, while his garments became white as light&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Matt. 17,2</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">], in the same way he will come from heaven like lightning, with power and great
glory to judge the universe. And as Peter, James and John were with him on the holy
mountain, so the elect will be with him in the kingdom of heaven, enjoying his ineffable
manifestation as God and inexpressible joy. And who is adequate for all this? Who is
worthy to attain that joy? Who else but one whose way of life is pure and undefiled? For
since our God is pure, or rather the highest light, he comes to the pure, and as he has
placed a pure soul in us, he will also ask it from us pure. For since it has been made
according to God&#146;s image and likeness, that is to say as a figure<sup>1</sup> of the
divine beauty, it has also shared in that beauty. And knowing this the poet speaks thus,
&#145;Lord, by your will you granted power to my beauty&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Psalm 29,8</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">], that is to say to the beauty of the soul, lest, having turned away towards the
ugly passions of sin and become disfigured, it fall from God and his divine rewards. Since
therefore it is agreed that our soul should be like this, lovely and beautiful, and that
we should give it back to God like a pledge on the last day, the day of resurrection, I
beg and urge that we love this beauty and carefully guard this loveliness, not turning
back to the fair things of the present age or to the beauties of flesh and blood. They are
not beauties, but idols of beauty; they are rather corruption and change. And this we can
learn from the end of things, for one who today is outstandingly beautiful and fair of
face<sup>2</sup> is tomorrow cast into a tomb, stinking and abhorrent. So there is nothing
fair and loveable but exemplary virtue, which should be our chief pursuit, my brothers.
But if admittedly it frequently happens that the soul grows slack and is defiled by
unseemly thoughts -- for who will boast that they have a pure heart? -- let it be quickly
made clean again and brought back to its former condition, lest by delaying in evil it
gives birth to death. And let no one ever say that they cannot be made clean again,
stained as they are by many sins, when they listen to the One who said, &#145;Though your
sins are like scarlet, I will make them white as snow. Though they are like crimson, I
will make them white as wool&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Isaias 1,18</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. Do you see
God&#146;s ineffable love for humankind? Not only has he promised to purify, but to bring
the one who repents to the pinnacle of loveliness. And examples are manifest. </p>

<p>David was a prophet and, when he fell into the crime of adultery and murder, he did not
give up, but after he had swiftly had recourse to repentance, he received the grace of
prophecy once again. Manasse perverted Israel for fifty two years, but when he repented,
he too found salvation. The prince of the Apostles, after his denial, by the medicine of
tears took up again the burden of the apostolate. Mary of Egypt, to pass over the
numberless others, had reached the uttermost limit of debauchery, but once she had come to
a remarkable repentance, she attained the highest degree of virtue. So there is no excuse
for claiming incapacity for someone who chooses to be saved, unless they are insensible or
bent on death<sup>3</sup>. But we hear the words, &#145;Why would you die, house of
Israel?&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Ezekiel 18,31</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">], and why do we choose everlasting death rather than
immortal life that is set before us? Our good Master cries out each day, &#145;Come to me
all you that toil and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Matthew 11,28</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. And we are unwilling to get rid of the heavy load of our sins. The same Master
cries, &#145;I am the light of the world. One who follows me will not walk in darkness,
but will have the light of life&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">John 8,12</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. But we turn to the
opposite, proclaiming by our actions, &#145;We do not want to know your ways&#146; [J</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">ob 21,14</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. All that remains is for us to hear, &#145;Walk by the light of your fire and
the flame you have kindled&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Isaias 50,11</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. And Scripture
says, &#145;Those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Galatians 5,21</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. But God forbid that such things should be said of us.
&#145;For you are may friends, says the Lord, if you do all that I command you&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">John 15,14</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. So then, let us do all that we have been commanded, that we may be worthy to
be called friends, to inherit the kingdom of heaven, in Christ our Lord, to whom be glory
and might, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
Amen.</font></p>
