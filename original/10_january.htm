<p>Venerable Father, most holy Gregory; full pen of the breath of the Advocate 
and clear tongue of Orthodoxy; lamp of the divine brightness with many lights; 
herald of truth, rampart of theology; wellspring of high doctrines; torrent of 
teachings that flow with honey; lyre tuned to God’s voice of songs composed by 
God that delights the minds of believers. All-wise Father, entreat Christ, 
implore Christ, who refashioned the world in the streams of Jordan, to save our 
souls.</p>
<p>Venerable Father, all-honoured Gregory; axe that fells the assaults of 
heretics, two-edged sword of the Advocate; knife that cuts out adulterated 
seeds; fire that burns up the undergrowth of heresies; true farmer’s winnowing 
fan by which the weight and lightness of doctrines is well distinguished; 
measuring rod of strict accuracy that directs all into paths of salvation. Ever 
entreat Christ, implore Christ, who refashioned the world in the streams of 
Jordan, to save our race.</p>
<p>Venerable Father, all-blessed Gregory; mouth that pours out blessed words, 
drawing them from the inexhaustible and divine wells of salvation, expounding 
for all words of prayer; rule that directs to virtue; you became radiant by 
contemplation of things divine, illumined by the brightness of the uncreated 
Trinity, whose invincible champion you became. Venerable Father, entreat Christ, 
implore Christ, who refashioned the world in the streams of Jordan, to save our 
race. </p>

<p>Making your word of wisdom radiant by unapproachable virtue, Gregory of 
Nyssa, you became all fair in both, with your voice inspired by God beautifying 
and delighting the people spiritually, expounding with great wisdom the 
consubstantial godhead of the Trinity; and so, making war with orthodox 
doctrines on outlandish heresies, you roused the might of the faith to the ends 
of the earth. As you stand by Christ with the bodiless Ministers, ask for our 
souls his peace and great mercy. </p>

<p>The hand of the Baptist trembled when it touched your immaculate head; the 
river Jordan was turned back, not daring to minister to you; for how could the 
river that had stood in awe of Jesus son of Navi not be seized with alarm at its 
Maker? But you, our Saviour, fulfilled the whole dispensation, that you might 
save the world by your Epiphany, only lover of humankind. </p>

<p>Having achieved a life inspired by God, you made its practice bright by 
contemplation, Gregory, revealer of God; for loving wisdom with divine ardour, 
you were enriched with grace from the mouth of the Spirit. Distilling the 
sweetness of your words like honeycomb, you ever make God’s Church joyful with 
divine thoughts. And so, as you dwell a high priest in heaven, intercede

humankind’. </p>

<p>As you were baptized in the Jordan, Lord, the worship of the Trinity was made 
manifest; for the voice of the Father bore witness to you, naming you the 
Beloved Son; and the Spirit, in the form of a dove, confirmed the sureness of 
the word. Christ God, who appeared and enlightened the world, glory to you! </p>
