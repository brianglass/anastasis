<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Winning the victory over Hell, O Christ, you ascended the Cross, that you might raise
with yourself those sitting in the darkness of death, you who are free among the dead.
All-powerful Saviour, who pour life from your own light, glory to you!</p>

<p>Today Christ, having trampled down death, has risen as he said, and given joy to the
whole world, that we might all cry aloud the hymn and say: All-powerful Saviour, Source of
life, unapproachable Light, glory to you!</p>

<p>Where shall we sinners flee from you, Lord, who are present in all creation? In heaven?
You dwell there. In Hell? You have trampled on death. To the depths of the sea? Your hand
is there, Master. To you we flee; falling down we implore you: O risen from the dead, have
mercy upon us!</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Lord has been taken up into heaven, that he may send the Paraclete to the world.
The heavens have prepared his throne; clouds his ascent. Angels marvel to see a human high
above them. The Father receives the One he holds eternally in his bosom. The Holy Spirit
orders all his Angels: &#145;Lift up our gates, you rulers.&#146; All you nations, clap
your hands: for Christ has gone up to where he was before</p>

<p>The Cherubim, Lord, were amazed by your Assumption, as they watched you, the God who is
enthroned upon them, ascending on the clouds; and we glorify you, for your mercy is kind.
Glory to you!</p>

<p>As we watch your exaltation on the holy mountains, O Christ, splendour of the Father's
glory, we hymn the appearance, formed of light, of your countenance; we worship your
sufferings, we honour your Resurrection, as we glorify your glorious Assumption. Have
mercy on us.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Of the Holy Fathers. Same Tone.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You were born from the womb before the morning star, without a mother from the Father
before the ages, though Arius dares to call you a creature, and does not glorify you as
God, insanely joining you, the Creator, with the creatures, and laying up for himself as
treasure the fuel of the eternal fire. But the Council in Nicea loudly proclaimed you,
Lord, to be Son of God, equal in rank with the Father and the Spirit.</p>

<p>Who divided your garment, O Saviour? &#145;Arius,&#146; you said, who cuts into
divisions the Authority equal in honour of the Trinity. He it was who denied that you were
one of the Trinity. He it was who taught Nestorios not to say &#145;Mother of God&#146;.
But the Council in Nicea loudly proclaimed you, Lord, to be Son of God, equal in rank with
the Father and the Spirit.</p>

<p>Arius fell into the precipice of sin, having shut his eyes so as not to see the light,
and he was ripped asunder by a divine hook so that with his entrails he forcibly emptied
out all his essence and his soul, and was named another Judas, both for his ideas and the
manner of his death. But the Council in Nicea loudly proclaimed you, Lord, to be Son of
God, equal in rank with the Father and the Spirit.</p>

<p>Arius the insane cut the Monarchy of the All-holy Trinity into three dissimilar and
unrelated Essences; therefore the Godbearing Fathers eagerly came together, burning with
zeal, like Elias the Thesbite, and cut off with the sword of the Spirit the blasphemer
with his teachings of shame, as the Spirit decreed.</p>

<p>Let us praise today the mystical trumpets of the Spirit, the Godbearing Fathers, who
sang a harmonious melody of theology in the midst of the Church: one Trinity, unchanging
Essence and Godhead; the overthrowers of Arius, the champions of the Orthodox, who ever
intercede with the Lord that he have mercy on our souls.</p>

<p>Who will not call you blessed, all-holy Virgin? Who will not sing the praise of your
child-birth without pain? For the only-begotten Son, who shone from the Father beyond
time, came forth from you, pure Maiden, ineffably incarnate. By nature he is God; by
nature he became man for our sakes; not divided in a duality of persons; but known without
confusion in a duality of natures. O honoured and all-blessed, intercede with him to have
mercy on our souls.</font></p>

Readings:</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from Genesis.<br>
[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">14,14-20</font>]</p>

<p>Now when Abram heard that Lot his nephew had been taken captive, he numbered his own
home-born servants, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued after them as far as Dan. And
he fell upon them by night, he and his servants, and smote them and pursued them as far as
Chobal, which is on the left of Damascus. And he brought back all the cavalry of Sodom,
and he brought back Lot his nephew and all his goods and the women and the people. And the
king of Sodom came out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chodologómor
and the kings with him, to the valley of Sabí; this is the plain of a king. And
Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought out loaves and wine; he was priest of the most high
God. And he blessed Abram and said: Blessed is Abram by the most high God, who created the
heaven and the earth. And blessed is the most high God, who has delivered your enemies
into your hand.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from Deuteronomy.<br>
[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">1,8-11 &amp; 15-17b</font>]</p>

<p>Moses said to the children of Israel: See, I have handed over the land in front you; go
in and inherit the land which I swore to your fathers, to Abraham and to Isaac and to
Jacob, that I would give it to them and to their seed after them. And I spoke to you at
that time saying: I shall not be able to bear you alone. The Lord your God has multiplied
you, and behold, you are today as the stars of heaven in multitude. May the Lord the God
of our fathers multiply you a thousand times more than you are, and bless you as He has
spoken to you. And I took from you wise and understanding and prudent men, and I set them
to rule over you, captains of thousands and hundreds and fifties and tens and recorders
for your judges. And I commanded your judges at that time, saying: Hear cases between your
brethren, and judge rightly between a man and his brother and the proselyte who is with
him. You shall not have respect to persons in judging. You shall hear the small as well as
the great. You shall not shrink before any man's person; for the judgement is God's.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading from Deuteronomy.<br>
[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">10,14-18 &amp; 20-21</font>]</p>

<p>Moses said to the children of Israel: Behold, the heaven and the highest heaven, the
earth and all that is in it belong to the Lord your God. The Lord preferred your fathers,
to love them: and he chose their seed after them, you above all nations, as it is at this
day. So circumcise the hardness of your heart and stiffen your neck no longer. For the
Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and strong and
awesome, who shows no partiality and takes no bribe. He executes judgement for the
proselyte, the orphan and the widow; and loves the proselyte, giving him food and
clothing. You shall fear the Lord your God and serve him, and to him you shall hold fast,
and take oaths in his name. He is your boast, and he your God, who has done for you the
great and wonderful things which your eyes have seen.</font></p>

<p>You have become strict guardians of the apostolic traditions, holy Fathers: for by
teaching the orthodox doctrine that the holy Trinity is consubstantial, you overthrew in
council the blasphemy of Arius; after him you refuted Makedonios, opponent of the Spirit,
you condemned Nestorios, Eftyches and Dioscoros, Sabellios and the leaderless Severos;
ask, we pray, that, delivered from their error, we may guard our life unsullied in the

<p>Let us with faith celebrate today the yearly memory of the god-bearing Fathers, who
were assembled from the whole world in the shining city of Nicaea, as we reverence the
gatherings of the Orthodox; for they, their minds attuned to true religion, overthrew the
godless teaching of Arius, and in council banished him from the Catholic Church; and in
the Symbol of faith which they precisely and devoutly laid down, they taught all to
confess clearly the Son of God as consubstantial and co-eternal, and existing before the
ages. And so we too, following their divine teachings and firm in our belief worship the
Son and the all-holy Spirit with the Father, in one Godhead a consubstantial Trinity.</p>

ages and from generations, you came with your Disciples to the mount of Olives, having
with you her who gave birth to you, the Maker and Creator of all things; for it was
necessary that she, who had suffered so greatly as a mother at your passion, should also
be filled with joy beyond measure at the glory of your flesh. We too, Master, sharing in
