<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 1. Tone 5.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>As we hymn the might of the single and three-sunned form, we cry: All-powerful God
irradiate our mind and raise it, Master, to your ineffable glory.</p>

<p>Far above, the spiritual orders of the Angels ceaselessly hymn you with thrice-holy
songs, Unity triple in number of like form and Trinity of like form, beyond being and
all-powerful.</p>

<p>Impart to my soul, O Trinity, Unity source of light, the sweet light-giving nectar of
your love and godly, cleansing compunction, most merciful Master of all creation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 3.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The spiritual beings you conceived and caused them to subsist to hymn your Godhead
unceasingly, O God, triple light and maker of all; but accept too the supplication of
creatures of clay and earth, and their entreaty, as you are compassionate.</p>

<p>By nature you admit no alteration; grant to us who are changeable and who sing the
unsearchable fount of your goodness pardon of offences and salvation as you are
compassionate.</p>

<p>We glorify you, Father, Son and Spirit in the unchangeable form of the Godhead, the
single and triple-shining Lord, as the Prophets and Apostles were clearly taught by you.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>As the Angel of Great Counsel of the Almighty you appeared to Moses in the bush, O Word
of God; foreshowing your incarnation from a Virgin through which you have transformed us
and made us mount to heaven.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Kathisma.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You are merciful, O undivided Trinity; for you have mercy on all as all-powerful; you
are all-pitying, compassionate and full of mercy. Therefore we flee to you, sinners
weighed down by many sins who cry: Have mercy on your servants and deliver us all from
every punishment.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>All-holy Virgin, have mercy on us, who with faith flee to you in your compassion, and
ask for your fervent assistance; for as you are good you have power to save us all, as you
are Mother of God most high and ever employ your motherly intercessions, O full of God's
grace.</font></p>

going towards the Father and the Spirit who revealed the vision.(</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>Make worthy of the Angels&#146; glory those who with mouths of clay sing the praise of

<p>Wooded and shaded mountain, which Avvakoum saw of old, from which the Holy One came
forth, you revealed the offspring, hard to contemplate, O Virgin, of your conceiving.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 5.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>O threefold light, my God, who through goodness created humankind and made it according
to your image, come, dwell in me, as you are good and love humankind.</p>

<p>O three-sunned Unity, guide me to the paths of your divine salvation and fill me with
your radiance, as by nature God of infinite power.</p>

<p>The one nature&#146;s undivided light, separated in persons, triple brightness, knowing
no evening, irradiate my heart with your beams.</font></p>

<p>As the Interpreter of old saw you, O pure and all-immaculate, as a gate looking towards
the unsetting light, he at once knew you to be the dwelling place of God.</font></p>

<p>Let us now glorify the three-sunned radiance and let us worship the simple Trinity, for
it has enlightened us and delivered from corruption the whole race of mortals, delivered

<p>Wholly at a loss, I have fled to you, the hope of all, and the refuge of sinners and
the humble, as I cry: I have sinned. But I, insensitive wretch, continue in my badness;
have mercy on me before the end, turn me back and deliver me, the unworthy, from every
punishment.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>In possessing an abyss and an infinite sea of mercy, pitying Lord, have mercy on those
who hymn you, one God all things and yet threefold light.</p>

<p>Praising you the incomprehensible, single yet triple light, God and Lord, we cry to
you: Grant to your servants pardon of offences.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 8.</font></p>

<p>Even that of old you might clearly reveal the triple hypostasis of the one Lordship,
you appeared, my God, in human form to Abraham as he praised your single might. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>Let me be worthy to descry your divinely working rays, O unapproachable light,

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 9.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Mortal speech has no strength to hymn you worthily, O Unity without beginning; unless,
daring as far as is attainable from faith, O Trinity of equal throne, we offer divine
glory and praise to your might. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>With mouths unsullied, Cherubim and Seraphim glorify you, the one God of threefold

your might.</font></p>
