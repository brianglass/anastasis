<p>Psalm 83</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
How beloved are your dwellings, O Lord of hosts; my soul longs and faints for
the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.
For the sparrow has found itself a house, and the dove a nest for herself, where
she may place her nestlings. Your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
Blessed are those who dwell in your house, they will praise you for ever and
ever. Blessed the man whose help is from you; he has placed ascents in his
heart, to the valley of weeping, to the place he has set. For the lawgiver will
give blessings; they will go from strength to strength, the God of gods will
appear in Sion. O Lord God of hosts hear my prayer, give ear, O God of Jacob. O
God our shield see; and look on the face of your Christ. For one day in your
courts is far better than thousands. I have chosen to be cast aside in the house
of my God, rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners. O Lord God of hosts,
blessed the man who hopes in you.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 84</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
You have been well pleased with your land, O Lord, you have turned away the
captivity of Jacob. You have forgiven your people their iniquities, you have
covered all their sins. You have made all your anger cease, you have turned away
from the anger of your rage. Turn us back again, O God of our salvation, and
turn away your rage from us. Will you be angry with us for ever? Or will you
prolong your wrath from generation to generation? O God, when you have turned us
back you will make us live, and your people will rejoice in you. O Lord, show us
your mercy, and grant us your salvation. I shall hear what the Lord will say in
me; for he will speak peace to his people, to his holy ones, to those who turn
their hearts back to him. But his salvation is near those who fear him, that
glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth have met, righteousness and peace
have kissed. Truth has dawned from the earth, and justice has leaned down from
heaven. For the Lord will give goodness, and our earth will give its fruit.
Justice will walk before him, and set his steps in the way.</p>

<p>Psalm 85</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear me, for I am poor and needy. Guard my soul,
for I am holy; O my God, save your servant who hopes in you. Have mercy on me,
Lord, for I shall cry to you all the day; give joy to the soul of your servant,
for I have lifted up my soul to you. For you, Lord, are good and gentle, and
full of mercy to all who call on you. Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; and attend
to the voice of my supplication. In the day of my trouble I called to you, for
you have heard me. There is none like you among the gods, O Lord; none whose
works are as yours. All the nations whom you made will come and worship before
you, O Lord, and call upon your name. For you are great and do wondrous things;
you alone are God. Guide me, Lord, in your way, and I shall walk in your truth;
make my heart glad to fear your name. I shall give you thanks, O Lord, my God,
with my whole heart; and I shall glorify your name for ever. For your mercy is
great towards me, and you have delivered my soul from the lowest hell. O God,
the lawless rose up against me, and an assembly of mighty ones sought my soul,
and did not set you before them. And you, Lord, are pitying and merciful,
long-suffering and full of mercy and true. Look on me and have mercy on me; give
your might to your servant and save the son of your maidservant. Make for me a
sign for good, and let those who hate me see it and be shamed; for you, Lord,
have helped me and comforted me.</p>

<p>Between two thieves your Cross became the scales of justice: the one was
dragged down to hell by the weight of his blasphemy, but the other lightened of
his faults was raised to the knowledge of the things of God. Christ God, glory
to you.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Both now.</p>
<p>Seeing the Lamb and Shepherd and Saviour of the world on the Cross, she who

made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made; for our
sake and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and was incarnate from the
Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man; he was crucified also for us
under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried; he rose again on the third
day, in accordance with the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven and is seated
at the right hand of the Father; he is coming again in glory to judge the living
and the dead; and his kingdom will have no end.</p>
<p>And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life, who proceeds from the
Father, who together with Father and Son is worshipped and together glorified;

we have abandoned the way of your justice and walked in the will of our hearts.

have been wasted in vanity. Rescue us from the hand of our opponent, forgive us
