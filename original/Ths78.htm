<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">On listening with
understanding to the holy Scriptures.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Brethren and fathers, all we human beings have eyes and ears; however it is not given
to all to see and hear, but to those who in addition have a ear which obeys and an eye for
looking. That is why the Lord says in the Gospels, &#145;Those who have ears to hear, let
them hear&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Matthew 13,9</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. While of those who are hard of hearing the Prophet says,
&#145;God gave them a spirit of compunction, eyes for not looking and ears for not
hearing&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Romans 11,8</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. We should surely then listen with understanding to the
things that are read to us, not simple-mindedly or anyhow, so that we may not fall beneath
the threat, but rather that we may able to say, as it is written, &#145;The Lord&#146;s
training opens my ears&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Isaias
50,5</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. The one who hears like this is attentive
and moved by compunction, as we sing in David&#146;s Psalms, &#145;Rejoice in the Lord,
you just&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Psalm 32,1</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. Such a person considers everything here to be a passing
shadow; considers everything to be rubbish, so that he may gain Christ [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Cf. Philippians 3,8</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. Just as he hears him saying to his Disciples, &#145;I will
not leave you orphans. I am coming to you. A little while, and the world sees me no
longer. But you see me, because I live and you will live&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">John 14,18-19</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. And again, &#145;I am the vine and you are the branches&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">John 15,5</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. And again, &#145;You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you. I no
longer call you servants, because the servant does not know what his lord does. But I have
called you friends, because everything that I have heard from my Father, I have made known
to you&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">John 15,14-15</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. And again, &#145;You have remained with me in my trials,
and I make a covenant with you &#151; an eternal covenant &#151; that you may eat and
drink for ever at my table in my kingdom&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Luke 22,28-30</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. When someone who
loves God hears such words, they not only rejoice but also choose to die for Christ every
day. This then was how all the Saints lived their lives, with statements such as these
they gloried triumphantly of their longing for God. Jeremias says, &#145;I did not grow
weary following you, Lord, nor did I desire any human day&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Jeremias 17,16</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. David says, &#145;What shall I give the Lord in return for
all that he has given me? I will take the cup of salvation and call on the name of the
Lord&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Psalm 115,3-4</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">], while the Apostle again says, &#145;It has been given us
by God not only to believe in Christ, but also to suffer for him&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Philippians 1,29</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. Similarly the Apostles, after they had been flogged,
rejoiced, as Scripture says, &#145;because they had been found worthy to be dishonoured
for the name of Christ&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Acts
5,41</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]. In short each of the Saints with words
like these reveals their love for Christ. And therefore, brethren, let us too hear
obediently what is said and love our beloved God with love, always giving thanks for all
the good things that he has done for us, that he chose us from the beginning for salvation
by the sanctification of our profession here; that he gave us the grace to worship him
with orthodox faith and not be carried astray. For how many have gone astray, utterly
deceived &#145;by human trickery, by villainy to the cunning of error&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Ephesians 4,14</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]! How many are famished &#145;not with a famine of bread or
thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the word of God&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Amos 8,11</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">], as it is written! To us has been given, like a full table, the teaching of the
Saints, whence one works the divine words like a goldsmith, another and another from here
and from there sweetens by his utterances. It is opportune then to say with the Apostle,
&#145;If God is for, who is against us? For the One who did not spare his own Son, but
handed him over for us all, how will he not with him also grant us all things? Who will
bring a charge against God&#146;s chosen one? It is God who justifies. Who then condemns?
It was Christ who died, yet rather he was raised from the dead, who is also at the right
hand of God and who also makes intercession for us&#146; [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Romans 8,31-34</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">], to God
the Father that is, and who will also bestow on us his eternal kingdom, for to him belong
glory and might, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of
ages, Amen. </font>
