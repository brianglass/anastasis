</font><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4">
<p>You were enlightened by the rays of the Spirit when love inspired by God set 
you aflame and gave wings to your soul to long for the true highest point of 
love. Then you despised both flesh and blood and, united to this love by great 
ascetic toil and stillness, you lived far from the world. Therefore, Antony, you 
were filled, as you had sought, with good things from there, and, like a shining 
Star, gave light to our souls.</p>
<p ALIGN="RIGHT">(</font><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font SIZE="4" face="Palatino Linotype">)</p>
<p>By the grace of God’s Spirit you smashed the arrows and darts of the demons, 
and you unmasked their wickedness and ambush for all by godlike teachings, as 
you blazed with godlike radiance and became the brightest beacon of monastics, 
and the first ornament of the desert, most experienced and revered physician of 
the sick and archetypal model of virtuous living, Father Antony.</p>
<p ALIGN="RIGHT">(</font><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font SIZE="4" face="Palatino Linotype">)</p>
<p>Filled with God’s gifts of grace, Christ, having found you as an unsullied 
mirror of the manifestations of God, made the bright lightning flashes of his 
own light blaze for you. From this you appeared as an unstinted source of 
healings, nourishment for the starving and quenching through abundant rains the 
desire of the thirsty, while seeing the dispositions of souls, by your word you 
wisely made them better for God. Implore him to save and enlighten our souls.</p>
<p>Pure in soul and heart, an Angel on earth, a heavenly mortal, teacher of 
virginity, accurate measure of self-mastery, blessed Antony, united to your 
Master and bringing to him with the Angels, all the holy Ascetics and Martyrs 
the never silent hymn of glory, free from dread dangers and faults all those who 
ever celebrate your sacred memory.</p>

<p>Having preserved unblemished that which is according to God’s image, by 
ascetic endeavour determining the mind as leader against destructive passions, 
you ascended as far as possible to that which is according to God’s likeness. 
For bravely overmastering nature, you hastened to submit the worse to the 
better, and to make the flesh the slave of the spirit. Therefore you were named 
‘summit of monastics’, ‘founder of the desert’, ‘trainer of those who run well’, 
‘most accurate rule of virtue’, and now in heaven, Antony, where mirrors are 
abolished, you look directly at the holy Trinity, appealing with no intermediary 
on behalf of those who honour you with faith and love.</p>

<p>Who will not call you blessed, All-holy Virgin? Who will not hymn your 
child-birth without labour? For the only-begotten Son, who shone from the Father 
beyond time, came forth from you, pure Maiden, ineffably incarnate. By nature he 
is God, by nature he became man for our sakes, not divided in a duality of 
persons, but known without confusion in a duality of natures. O honoured and 
all-blessed, implore him to have mercy on our souls.</p>

<p>Constructing an ascetic gymnasium on earth, Venerable Antony, you blunted all 
the assaults of the passions with the stream of your tears. Your godly way of 
life was acknowledged for all as a ladder leading up to heaven; for by it you 
displayed the fruits of true religion, and through them you the diseases of the 
passions of those who cry to with faith, ‘Hail, radiant golden star of the East, 
torchbearer and shepherd of Monastics! Hail, fairest offspring of the desert, 
and unshakeable bulwark of the Church! Hail, great guide of those who gone 
astray! Hail, our boast, and bright glory of the inhabited world!</p>

<p>Venerable Father, from childhood you practised virtue assiduously and became

<p>Venerable Antony, as though at rest among non-material things, you 
accomplished the ardent and courageous life of the strictest discipline, and 
bravely resisting the assaults of demons, you triumphed over their weakness and 
their soul-destroying error; while you displayed the force and invincible power 
of the Saviour’s Cross; and girded with its power, you defeated all those who 
reject Christ’s divine manifestation through the flesh. Implore him that our

<p>Venerable Father, when you heard the voice of the Lord’s Gospel you abandoned 
the world, reckoning its wealth and glory to be nothing. And so you cried to 
all, ‘Love God, and you will find everlasting grace. Prefer nothing to his love, 
so that when he comes in his glory, you may find rest with all the Saints. At 
his intercessions, O Christ, guard and save our souls.</p>
