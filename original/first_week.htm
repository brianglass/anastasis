<p>A Vision which Isaias, son of Amos, saw, which he saw against Judea and 
Jerusalem, in the reign of Ozias and Jotham and Achaz and Ezekias, who reigned 
over Judea. Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, because the Lord has spoken. 
I begot children and exalted them, but they rejected me. An ox knows its owner, 
and an ass its lord’s manger; but Israel does not know me, and my people has not 
understood. Woe, sinful nation, people full of sins, evil seed, lawless 
children! You have deserted the Lord and angered the Holy One of Israel. Why 
would you still be smitten as you add iniquity to iniquity? The whole head is in 
pain and the whole heart in grief; from feet to head there is no wholeness, 
nothing but wound, bruise, festering sore; it is not possible to apply plaster, 
or oil, or bandages. Your land is desert, your cities destroyed by fire; as for 
your country foreigners devour it before your eyes, and it has become a desert, 
ravaged by foreign peoples. The daughter of Sion will be abandoned, like a tent 
in a vineyard and like a store house in cucumber patch, like a city besieged. 
And had the Lord of hosts not left us seed, we had become like Sodom and been 
made like Gomorrha. Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom. Attend to the 
law of God, people of Gomorrha. What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? 
says the Lord; I am full of holocausts of rams, and the fat of rams and the 
blood of bulls and goats I do not want. You are not to come to appear to me; who 
sought these things from your hands? You shall no more come to trample my 
courts; if you bring flour it is vain; incense is an abomination to me. Your new 
moons and Sabbaths and high days I do not endure; fast and holiday and your 
feasts my soul hates; you have become a excess for me, I shall no longer forgive 
your sins. When you stretch out your hands to me, I shall turn away me eyes from 
you; and if you multiply supplication, I shall not listen to you; for your hands 
are full of blood. Wash and become clean; put away the evils from your souls; in 
my sight cease from your evils, learn to do good, seek out judgement, deliver 
the wronged, judge for the orphan and do justice to the widow. And come, let us 
reason together, says the Lord; and if your sins are as scarlet, I will make 
them white as snow, while if they are crimson, I will make them white as wool. 
And if you are willing and will listen to me, you eat the good things of the 
land; but if you are not willing, and will not listen to me, a sword devours 
you; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.</p>

said: Let the water below heaven be gathered together into one gathering, and 
let dry land appear; and it was so. And the water below heaven was gathered 
together into their gatherings, and the dry land appeared. And God called the 
dry land Earth, and the accumulations of the waters he called Seas. And God saw

<p>Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, who reigned in Israel, for knowing wisdom 
and instruction, understanding words of prudence, receiving difficulties of 
words, understanding true justice and directing judgement; that he might give 
cunning to the innocent, to a young man perception and understanding. For a wise 
man hearing these will be wiser, while the man of understanding will gain 
guidance; and will understand both parable and dark word, sayings of the wise 
and riddles. The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord; while there is 
good understanding for all those who do it; true religion towards God is the 
beginning of perception; while the godless will reject wisdom and instruction. 
Hear, my son, your father’s instruction and do not reject your mother’s rules. 
For you will receive a crown of graces for your head and a golden collar about 
your neck. My son, do not let godless men lead you astray, nor be willing, if 
they invite you, saying: Come with us, partake of blood, let us hide unjustly a 
just man in the earth; let us drink him down living, like Hell, and remove his 
memory from the earth; and let us lay hold on his valuable property; let us fill 
our houses with spoils; cast in your lot with us, and let us all obtain a common 
purse, and let their be one wallet for us; do not go in the way with them; turn 
aside your foot from their paths; for their feet run to wickedness and are swift 
to shed blood. For nest are not unjustly spread for birds. For they share in 
murder, store up evils for themselves; the overthrow of lawless men is evil. 
These are the ways of all that accomplish lawless deeds, for by godlessness they 
do away with their own soul. Wisdom is praised in the streets, in the squares 
brings boldness.</p>

a sword devours you; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this. How has faithful 
Sion, full of judgement, become a harlot city; in which justice once slept, but 
now murderers. You silver is worthless; your merchants mix wine with water; your 
rulers disobey, companions of thieves, loving bribes, running after reward, not 
judging for orphans, not giving judgement for widows. Because of this, thus says 
the Lord, the Master of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Woe to the strong in 
Jerusalem! For my wrath will not cease among my opponents; and I will execute 
judgement on my foes, and I will bring my hand upon you, and I will refine you 
into something pure; but the disobedient I will destroy, and remove all the 
lawless from you, and I will humble all the proud. And I will establish your 
judges as before, and your counsellors as from the beginning; and after this you 
shall be called a city of justice, mother city, faithful Sion; for with 
judgement will her captivity be saved, and with mercy. And the lawless will be 
crushed, and sinners as well, and those who have deserted the Lord will be 
utterly consumed. Therefore they will be shamed by their idols, which they

to justice, they will not be shamed; while the foolish, being ones who desire 
conceit, becoming ungodly, have hated perception, and have become subject to 
reproofs. See, I shall bring forth for you the utterance of my breath, while I 
shall teach you my word. Since I was calling and you did not obey, and I spoke 
at length and you paid no attention; but you made my counsels of no effect, you 
paid no attention to my reproofs; therefore I too shall laugh at your 
destruction; I shall rejoice when annihilation comes upon you, and disturbance 
arrives suddenly for you, while overthrow will come like a tempest, and when 
trouble and siege comes to us; or when annihilation comes to you; for it shall

<p>My son, if you accept utterance of my commandment and hide it in yourself, 
your ear will obey wisdom and you will apply your heart to understanding; you 
will apply it to the instruction of your son. For is you call upon wisdom and 
give your voice to understanding, while you seek perception with a loud voice, 
and if you seek it like silver, and search it out like treasures, then you will 
understand the fear of the Lord, and you will find knowledge of God; because the 
Lord gives wisdom and from his face &lt;come&gt; knowledge and understanding. And he 
treasures up salvation for those who act uprightly; he will protect their path, 
to guard the ways of just deeds; and to protect the way of those who respect 
him. Then you will understand justice and judgement, and direct all good 
courses. For if wisdom comes into the mind, while perception seems to be good to 
your soul, good counsel will guard you; while holy thought will watch over you, 
that it may deliver you from a wicked way, and from a man who speaks nothing 
trustworthy. Alas for those who abandon straight ways to journey in ways of 
darkness; who are glad at wickednesses, and rejoice at wicked perversity! Whose 
paths are crooked and whose tracks are winding, to take you far from the 
straight way, and make you a stranger to just purpose. My son, let not wicked

<p>This is the book of the genesis of heaven and earth, when it came to pass; in

[The LXX uses the word </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Kyrios</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">,

God made heaven and earth and every herb of the field, before it was on the 
earth, and every grass of the field, before sprang up; for God had not sent rain 
on the earth, and there was no man to work it. But a spring went up out of the 
earth and watered the face of the earth. And God fashioned man, dust from the 
earth, and breathed into his face a breath of life; and man became a living 
soul. And God planted Paradise </font>

but is taken by the Triodion as a proper name.]</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> 
in Edem, to the East, and he placed there the man he had fashioned. And God 
again made every tree fair to behold and good to eat to spring out of the earth; 
and the tree of life in the midst of Paradise, and the tree of knowing what can 
be known of good and evil. While a river came from Edem to water Paradise; from 
there it divides into four heads; the name of one is Phison, this encircles all 
the land of Evilat, where there is gold. The gold of that land is good; and 
there is carbuncle and the green stone. And the name of the second is Geon, this 
encircles the whole land of Ethiopia. And the third river is the Tigris, this is 
the one which flows out opposite the Assyrians. The fourth river is the 
Euphrates. And the Lord God took the man he had fashioned, and placed him in the 
Paradise of delight, to work it and guard it. And the Lord God commanded Adam, 
saying: From every tree in Paradise you may eat for food; but from the tree of 
knowing good and evil, you </font>

is not good for man to be alone; let us make a helper for him, corresponding to 
him. And God fashioned again from the earth all the flying creatures of heaven, 
and the wild beasts of the field; and he brought them to Adam to see what he 
would call them. And every name that Adam called each living soul, that was its

<p>My son, do not forget my laws, let your heart keep my words; for they will 
add to you length of life and years of life and peace. Do not let mercies and 
faith desert you; attach them to your neck, write them on the tables of your 
heart, and you will find grace; and take thought for what is good before the 
Lord and before men. Be trusting in God with your whole heart; do not be exalted 
in your own wisdom. In all your ways get to know her, that you may rightly 
direct your ways; and your foot not stumble. Do not be prudent in your own eyes; 
rather fear God and keep from every wickedness; then there will be healing for 
your body and treatment for your bones. Honour the Lord with your just labours 
and offer him the first of the fruits of your justice, that your stores may be 
filled to abundance with corn, that your presses may be bursting with wine. My 
son, do not treat lightly the Lord’s discipline, nor give up when you are 
rebuked by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves; scourges every child 
he receives. Blest the man who has found wisdom, every mortal who knows 
prudence. For it is better to trade for her than for treasures of gold and 
silver. She is more precious than valuable stones; nothing evil will withstand 
her; she is well known to all who draw near her, nothing precious is worthy of 
her, for length of life and years of life are in her right hand, while in her 
left are wealth and glory. Justice comes from her mouth; she carries law and 
mercy on her tongue. Her ways are good ways and all her paths are in peace. She 
is a tree of life to all who lay hold of her, and to those who lean hard upon 
her as upon the Lord she is safe.</p>

<p>See now, the Master, Lord of hosts, will take away from Judea and Jerusalem 
the strong man and the strong woman, strength of bread and strength of water, 
giant and strong and warrior and justice, prophet and diviner, elder and captain 
of fifty, wondrous counsellor and wise master-builder and understanding hearer. 
And I will set youths as their rulers, and scoffers will lord it over them. And 
the people will fall, man upon man, and man upon his neighbour; the child will 
insult the elder, the base the honourable. Because a man will seize his brother, 
or one of his own father’s house and say: You have a garment, become our prince, 
and let my food be under you. And answering in that day he will say: I will not 
be your prince; for there is neither garment nor food in my house; I will not be 
prince of this people, because Jerusalem is forsaken and Judea has fallen and 
their tongues are with iniquity and they disobey what concerns the Lord; 
therefore now their glory has been humbled and the shame of their face has stood 
against them; they have declared and manifested their sin like that of Sodom. 
Woe to their soul, because they have devised an evil counsel against themselves, 
saying: Let us bind the just, for he is burdensome to us; therefore they eat the 
products of their works. Woe to the lawless: evils will happen to him according 
to the works of his hands. My people, your bailiffs glean you, and your

<p>And Adam gave names to all the cattle and all the flying creatures of heaven 
and to all the wild beasts of the field; but for Adam there was not found a 
helper like himself. And God put a trance upon Adam, and he slept, and he took 
one of his ribs and filled up the flesh instead of it. And God built the rib 
which he had taken from Adam into a woman and brought her to Adam. And Adam 
said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 
Woman, because she has been taken from the Man. For this reason a man will leave 
behind his father and mother and be attached to his wife and they shall be two 
into one flesh. And they were both naked, Adam and his wife, and they were not 
ashamed. [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">3:1</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]

than all the beasts on the earth which the Lord God had made. And the serpent 
said to the woman: What is it God said: you are not to eat of any tree of 
Paradise? And the woman said to the serpent: From the fruit of the trees of 
Paradise we may eat; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of 
Paradise, God said: Do not eat of it, do not even touch it, lest you die. And 
the serpent said to the woman: By death you will not die; for God knows that on 
the day that you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be as gods 
knowing good and evil. And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat and that 
it was pleasing for the eyes to behold and fair for understanding; and she took 
of the fruit and ate; and she and she gave to her husband with her and they ate. 
And the eyes of the two of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; 
and they sewed fig leaves themselves together and made aprons for themselves. 
And the heard the voice of the Lord God as he walked in Paradise in the 
afternoon and Adam and his wife hid from the face of the Lord God in the middle 
of the trees of Paradise. And the Lord God called Adam and said to him: Adam, 
where are you? And he said to him: I heard your voice as you walked in Paradise, 
and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid. And God said to him: Who told 
you were naked, unless you have eaten of the tree of which alone I commanded you 
not to eat? And Adam said: The woman, whom you gave to be with me, she gave me 
of the tree, and I ate. And the Lord God said to the woman: Why did you do this? 
And the woman said: The serpent deceived me, and I ate. And the Lord God said to 
the serpent: Because you have done this, you are accursed above all the cattle 
and all the wild beasts on the earth; on your breast and on your belly you will 
go, and you will eat earth all the days of your life, and I shall place enmity 
between you and the Woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He will watch for 
your head, and you will watch for his heel. And to the woman he said: 
Multiplying I shall multiply your pains and your groaning; in pains you will 
give birth to children, and your recourse shall be to your husband, and he will 
lord it over you. While to Adam he said: Because you listened to the voice of 
your wife, and ate of the tree of which alone I commanded you not eat, you ate 
of it, the earth is accursed in your works; in pains you will eat all the days 
of your life; thorns and thistles it will bring up for you, and you shall eat 
the grass of the field; in the sweat of your brow you shall eat your bread, 
until you return to the earth from which you were taken; because you are earth 
and to earth you shall return. And Adam called his wife’s name Life </font>

<p>God founded the earth with wisdom, he prepared the heavens with prudence. By 
perception the deeps were broken up, and clouds dropped rains. My son, do not 
let this pass by you; keep my counsel and understanding, that your soul may live 
and grace may be upon your neck; there will be healing for flesh and treatment 
for your bones, that you may walk trustingly on all your ways in peace, that 
your foot may not stumble; for if sit you will be fearless, if you sleep you 
will slumber sweetly; and you be afraid of terror coming upon you, nor of 
assaults of the godless coming at you; for the Lord will be on all your ways, 
and he will establish your foot, lest you be shaken. Do not forbear to do good 
to one in need, whenever your hand is able to give help. Do not, while you are 
able to do good, say: Go, come back again; to-morrow I shall give; for you do 
not know what the coming day will bring to birth. Do not plot evils against your 
friend who lives near you and trusts you. Do not quarrel with someone without 
cause, lest he work some wickedness against you. Do not gain the reproaches of 
wicked men, nor imitate their ways. For every transgressor is unclean before the 
Lord; nor does he take his seat among the just. God’s curse is in the houses of 
the ungodly; while the abodes of the just are blessed. The Lord resists the 
proud; but to the humble he gives grace.</p>
