<p ALIGN="CENTER">THE HOLY AND DIVINE LITURGY<br>
OF THE<br>
PRESANCTIFIED GIFTS</p>
<hr size="3" color="#FF0000">
</font>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">There are numerous small
differences between the various Typica for the service of the Presanctified,
particularly at the end of the Ninth Hour and end of the Typika. The arrangement
given here represents, in the main, the use of the Holy Mountain, as given in
the editions of the Holy Monastery of Simonos Petra, prepared with the assistance
of Professor Phountoulis.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Those who use non-Orthodox
versions of Holy Scripture, that is most current versions, should note that the
Church‘s text of the prayer of the
Thief in St Luke‘s Gospel is ‘Remember
me, Lord, when you come in your kingdom‘, not ‘into your kingdom‘. The reference
is to the Lord‘s Second Coming ‘in glory with the holy Angels‘. In the
view of many non-Orthodox scholars this is the correct text.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">In the troparia following the
Beatitudes I have put ‘Lord Sabaoth‘,
not ‘Lord of Sabaoth‘, or ‘Lord of hosts‘, because the Fathers, among
them St Basil the Great, although they know the meaning of the Hebrew, point out
that this is one of the Hebrew words that the translators of the Septuagint did
not translate, and regard it as a sacred title of God. </font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">In the Litany for those to be
Enlightened I follow Professor Phountoulis in reading the invitation to them as ‘Draw
near‘, in Greek <i>proselthete</i>, and not ‘Depart‘, in Greek <i>proelthete</i>;
a difference of a single letter. </font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">The Triodion, in its long
rubric after Monday of the First Week, describes the ritual for the
Presanctified and it specifies ‘Three
metanias‘ at ‘Blessed be the name of the Lord‘ after the prayer behind the
Ambo. I have therefore included it here. </font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">It is also interesting to
note that the same long rubric says, on the subject of the Litany for those
preparing for Enlightenment, quite clearly,
‘It is to be known that the Diakonika for those to be enlightened and the
prayer are started from the Wednesday of the Mid-Fast and said until Great
Wednesday, not only at the Presanctified, but also on Saturdays and Sundays at
the Liturgies of Saint John Chrysostom and Saint Basil‘. The Slavonic
Triodion, on the other hand, in a rubric for the Wednesday of the Fourth Week,
expressly excludes Saturdays and Sundays. The rubric in the Greek Triodion is
likely to be the more ancient.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 83<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">How beloved are your dwellings, O Lord
of hosts; my soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my
flesh have rejoiced in the living God. For the sparrow has found itself a house,
and the dove a nest for herself, where she may place her nestlings. Your altars,
O Lord of hosts, my King and my God. Blessed are those who dwell in your house,
they will praise you for ever and ever. Blessed the man whose help is from you;
he has placed ascents in his heart, to the valley of weeping, to the place he
has set. For the lawgiver will give blessings; they will go from strength to
strength, the God of gods will appear in Sion. O Lord God of hosts hear my
prayer, give ear, O God of Jacob. O God our shield see; and look on the face of
your Christ. For one day in your courts is far better than thousands. I have
chosen to be cast aside in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the
tents of sinners. O Lord God of hosts, blessed the man who hopes in you.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 84</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
You have been well pleased with your land, O Lord, you have turned away the
captivity of Jacob. You have forgiven your people their iniquities, you have
covered all their sins. You have made all your anger cease, you have turned away
from the anger of your rage. Turn us back again, O God of our salvation, and
turn away your rage from us. Will you be angry with us for ever? Or will you
prolong your wrath from generation to generation? O God, when you have turned us
back you will make us live, and your people will rejoice in you. O Lord, show us
your mercy, and grant us your salvation. I shall hear what the Lord will say in
me; for he will speak peace to his people, to his holy ones, to those who turn
their hearts back to him. But his salvation is near those who fear him, that
glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth have met, justice and peace have
kissed. Truth has dawned from the earth, and righteousness has leaned down from
heaven. For the Lord will give goodness, and our earth will give its fruit.
Justice will walk before him, and set his steps in the way.</p>

<p>Psalm 85<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear me,
for I am poor and needy. Guard my soul, for I am holy; O my God, save your
servant who hopes in you. Have mercy on me, Lord, for I shall cry to you all the
day; give joy to the soul of your servant, for I have lifted up my soul to you.
For you, Lord, are good and gentle, and full of mercy to all who call on you.
Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplication. In
the day of my trouble I called to you, for you have heard me. There is none like
you among the gods, O Lord; none whose works are as yours. All the nations whom
you made will come and worship before you, O Lord, and call upon your name. For
you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God. Guide me, Lord, in your
way, and I shall walk in your truth; make my heart glad to fear your name. I
shall give you thanks, O Lord, my God, with my whole heart; and I shall glorify
your name for ever. For your mercy is great towards me, and you have delivered
my soul from the lowest hell. O God, the lawless rose up against me, and an
assembly of mighty ones sought my soul, and did not set you before them. And
you, Lord, are pitying and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy and true.
Look on me and have mercy on me; give your might to your servant and save the
son of your maidservant. Make for me a sign for good, and let those who hate me
see it and be shamed; for you, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.</p>

<p>Psalm 103<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my
God, you have been greatly magnified. You have clothed yourself with
thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching
out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his upper chambers with waters, placing
clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind, making spirits his Angels
and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its sure base; it
will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle; waters
will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at
the voice of your thunder. The mountains rise and the plains descend to the
place which you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass,
nor will they return to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys;
waters will run between the mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of
the field; the wild asses will await them to quench their thirst. Beside them
the birds of the air will make their dwelling: and sing among the rocks. He
waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will be filled from the
fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green herb for
the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the
human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human
heart. The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you
planted. There the sparrows will build their nests; the heron’s dwelling is at
their head. The high mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He
made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You
appointed darkness, and it was night, in which all the beasts of the forest will
prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to seek their food from God. The sun
rose and they were gathered together and they will lie down in their dens. Man
will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How your works
have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth
has been filled with your creation. Also this great, wide sea; there there are
creeping things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go
to and fro; this dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to
you to give them their food in due season. When you give it them, they will
gather it. When you open your hand all things will be filled with goodness. But
when you turn away your face they will be troubled. You will take away their
spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust. You will send forth your
spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of the earth. May
the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his works. He
looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they
smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist.
May my words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O
that sinners might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no
more. Bless the Lord, my soul!</p>

I will bless the Lord continually, his praise will always be in my mouth. My
soul will be praised in the Lord; let the meek hear it and rejoice. Magnify the
Lord with me, let us exalt his name together. I sought the Lord and he heard me,
and delivered me from all my afflictions. Come to him and be enlightened, and
your faces will not be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and
saved him from all his afflictions. The angel of the Lord will encamp round
those who fear him, and deliver them. Taste and see that the Lord is good.
Blessed the one who puts their hope in him! Fear the Lord, all you his saints,
for those who fear him never want. The rich have become poor and gone hungry,
but those who seek the Lord will not be deprived of any good. Come, children,
listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Who is there who wants
life, loves to see good days? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from
speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it. The
eyes of the Lord are on the just, and his ears towards their supplication. The
Lord’s face is set against those who do evil, to destroy their memory from the
earth. The just cried and the Lord heard them, and delivered them from all their
afflictions. The Lord is close to those who are broken-hearted, and will save
the humble in spirit. The afflictions of the just are many, but the Lord will
deliver them from them all. The Lord guards all their bones, not one of them
will be broken. The death of sinners is evil, and those who hate the just will
go astray. The Lord will rescue the souls of his servants, and no one of those
who hope in him will go astray.</p>

<p>Many books follow Psalm 33 with Psalm 144. The latter is not, strictly, part
of the Liturgy of the Presanctified, but the opening of Grace before Meals,
since in monasteries the single meal on a fast day is eaten immediately after
Vespers and the Liturgy of the Presanctified. For completeness sake, we add it
here as an appendix.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">PSALM 144<br>
Praise for David.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>I will exalt you, my God, my King; and I will bless your name for ever and to
age on age. Every day I will bless you; and praise your name for ever and to age
on age. The Lord is great and highly to be praised<b>;</b> and there is no limit
to his greatness. Generation after generation will praise your works; and will
declare your power. They will tell of the majesty of the glory of your holiness;
and will recount your wonders. They will speak of the power of your dread deeds;
and will recount your greatness. They will proclaim the memory of the multitude
of your goodness; and rejoice in your justice. The Lord is compassionate and
merciful; long-suffering and full of mercy. The Lord is good to all; and his
acts of compassion are for all his works. May all your works confess you, Lord;
and all your holy ones bless you. They will speak of the glory of your kingdom;
and tell of your power. To make known your power and of the glory the majesty of
your kingdom to the children of mankind. Your kingdom is a kingdom for all the
ages, and your dominion for every generation. The Lord is faithful in all his
words, and holy in all his works. The Lord supports all who are falling, and
sets upright all who are broken down. The eyes of all hope in you, and you give
them their food in due season. You open your hand, and fill every living thing
with your good pleasure. The Lord is just in all his ways, and holy in all his
works. The Lord is close to those who call on him, to all who call on him in
truth. He will do the will of those who fear him, and hear their supplication
and save them. The Lord guards all who love him, and all sinners he will
destroy. My mouth will tell the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his
holy name for ever and to age on age.</font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
