</font><b><font FACE="Book Antiqua">
<p>Psalm 5</font></b><font FACE="Book Antiqua"><br>
Give ear to my words, O Lord, understand my cry. Attend to the voice of my
supplication, my King and my God; for to you I shall pray, O Lord. In the
morning you will hear my voice. In the morning I shall stand before you, and you
will watch over me; because you are not a God who wants iniquity. The evildoer
will not dwell with you, nor will the lawless remain before your eyes. You have
hated all those who work iniquity; you will destroy all those who speak lies.
The Lord abhors a man of bloodshed and deceit. But I, in the abundance of your
mercy, will enter your house, I will worship towards your holy temple in fear of
you. Guide me, Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies, direct my way
before you. Because there is no truth in their mouths; their heart is vain.
Their throat is an open tomb, they deceive with their tongues. Judge them, O
God. Let them fall through their counsels; according to the multitude of their
impieties cast them out, for they have embittered you, O Lord. And may all those
who hope in you be glad; they will rejoice for ever, and you will dwell among
them, and all those who love your name will boast in you. Because you will bless
the righteous; you have crowned him, O Lord, with your good pleasure.</p>
<b>
<p>Psalm 89</b><br>
Lord, you have been our refuge from one generation to another. Before the
mountains came into being or the earth and the world were formed, from age to
age you are. Do not turn mankind back to humiliation, and you said: Turn back,
children of men. Because a thousand years in your eyes, Lord, are like a day, or
like yesterday which has passed, and like a watch in the night. Their years will
be mere trifles, in the morning like grass may he pass away. In the morning let
him flower and pass away; in the evening let him fall, dry up and wither.
Because we have perished in your anger, and in your wrath we have been dismayed.
You have set our iniquities before you; our age in the light of your
countenance. Because all our days have perished, and in your anger we have
perished; our years were reckoned like a spider. The days of our years there are
seventy years in them, but if we are strong, eighty, and the majority of them
are labour and toil; because weakness has come over us and we shall be
chastened. Who knows the might of your anger? And can gauge your wrath from fear
of you? So make your right hand known to me, and those chastened in heart by
wisdom. Turn back, O Lord, how long? And be entreated for your servants. We have
filled in the morning with your mercy, O Lord, and we have rejoiced and been
glad. In all our days let be glad; in return for the days when you humbled us,
the years when we saw evils. And look upon your servants and upon the work of
your hands and guide your children. And let the brightness of the Lord be upon
us, and direct the works of our hands for us, and direct the work of our hand.</p>
<b>
<p>Psalm 100</b><br>
I will sing to you of mercy and judgement, O Lord, I will chant and think on a
blameless way: when will you come to me? I have walked in the midst of my house
in the innocence of my heart. I have set no lawless deed before my eyes; I have
hated those who commit transgressions. No twisted heart has been attached to me;
the evil man who avoids me I have not acknowledged. The man who secretly
slanders his neighbour, him I have driven out. With a man of proud looks and
insatiate heart, I have not eaten. My eyes are upon the faithful in the land,
for them to dwell with me; the man who walks on a blameless way, he has
ministered to me. The man who acts proudly has not dwelt in my house; the man
who speaks calumnies has not prospered before me. Morning by morning I slew all
the sinners in the land, to purge from the Lord’s city all workers of
iniquity.</p>

</font><b><font FACE="Book Antiqua">
<p>Psalm 16</font></b><font FACE="Book Antiqua"><br>
Hearken to my righteousness, O Lord; attend to my supplication. Give ear to my
prayer from lips which do not deceive. Let my judgement come from your presence,
let my eyes see fair dealings. You have tested my heart, you have visited me by
night; you have tried me by fire and no injustice has been found in me. That my
mouth might not speak of human deeds, for the sake of the words of your lips I
have kept hard ways. Direct my steps in your paths, that my steps may not slip.
I have called, for you heard me, O God; incline your ear to me, and hearken to
my words. Show the wonder of your mercies, you who save those that hope in you.
Guard me, O Lord, like the pupil of the eye, from those who resist your right
hand. You will shelter me in the shelter of your wings, from the presence of the
impious who afflicted me. My foes have surrounded my soul; they have shut their
hearts, their mouth has spoken proudly. They cast me out and now they have
encircled me, they have fixed their eyes to bow to the ground. They came on me
like a lion ready for prey, and like a lion cub lurking in hidden places. Arise,
Lord, forestall them and cast them down; deliver my soul from the impious, your
sword from the foes of your hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of the land
in their life, and their belly was filled from your hidden things. They have
been sated with swine’s flesh and left the remainder to their infants. But I
in righteousness will appear in your presence; I shall be satisfied when your
glory has appeared to me.</p>
<b>
<p>Psalm 24<br>
</b>To you, O Lord, I have lifted my soul. My God, I have trusted in you, do not
let me be shamed for ever. Do not let my foes laugh at me; for all who wait
patiently for you shall not be shamed; let those who transgress without cause be
shamed. O Lord, make your ways known to me, and teach me your paths. Guide me
into your truth and teach me, for you are God my Saviour, and I have waited
patiently on you all the day. Remember your acts of pity, Lord, and your
mercies, for they are eternal. Do not remember the sins of my youth and
ignorance; in accordance with your mercy remember me, on account of your
goodness, O Lord. The Lord is good and upright, therefore he will give laws to
those who sin on their way. He will guide the meek with judgement, he will teach
the meek his ways. All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, for those who
seek his covenant and his testimonies. For your name’s sake, O Lord, pardon my
sin, for it is great. Who is one who fears the Lord? He will give him laws in
the way which he has chosen. His soul will dwell among good things and his seed
will inherit the earth. The Lord is the strength of those who fear him, and his
covenant will show them this. My eyes are ever towards the Lord, for he will
draw my feet out of the snare. Look on me and have mercy on me; for I am alone
and poor. The afflictions of my heart have been multiplied; bring me out of my
troubles. See my humiliation and my toil, and forgive all my sins. See my foes,
for they have been multiplied, and have hated me with an unjust hatred. Guard my
soul and deliver me; let me not be shamed, for I have hoped in you. The innocent
and upright have joined themselves to me, because I have waited patiently for
you, O Lord. O God, deliver Israel from all his afflictions.</p>
<b>
<p>Psalm 50<br>
</b>Have mercy on me O God, according to your great mercy: according to the
fullness of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me thoroughly from my
wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my wickedness: and my
sin is ever before me. Against you only have I sinned and done what is evil in
your sight: that you may be justified in your words, and win when you are
judged. For see, in wickedness I was conceived: and in sin my mother bore me.
For see, you have loved truth: you have shown me the hidden and secret things of
your wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed: you will
wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and
gladness: the bones which have been humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face
from my sins: and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God:
and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out from your presence: and
do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your salvation:
and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your
ways: and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation,
deliver me from bloodshed: and my tongue will rejoice at your righteousness. O
Lord, you will open my lips: and my mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you
had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it: you will not take pleasure in
burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit: a broken and a humbled
heart God will not despise. Do good to Zion, Lord, in your good pleasure; and
let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a
sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will
offer calves upon your altar.</p>

against me, and mighty ones have sought my soul, and have not put God before

Give ear to my prayer, O God, and do not despise my supplication; attend to me,
and hearken to me. I was grieved in my meditation, and troubled by the voice of
the foe and the affliction of the sinner. Because they cast iniquity upon me,
and in anger they were indignant with me. My heart was troubled within me, and
dread of death fell on me. Fear and trembling came upon me, and darkness covered
me. And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove’s, and I shall fly away and
find rest. See, I have gone far away in my flight, and have encamped in the
wilderness. I waited for God who saves me from faint-heartedness and from storm.
O Lord, drown and divide their tongues; because I have seen iniquity and
wrangling in the city. Day and night it will go round upon its walls, and
lawlessness and toil are in its midst, and injustice. Usury and fraud have not
left its streets. For if an enemy had reviled me, I would have endured it. And
if one who hated me had boasted against me, I would have hidden from him. But it
was you, one who was my equal, my leader and my friend. Who made sweet the food
we ate together; we walked in harmony in God’s house. Let death come upon
them, and let them go down alive into Hades. For evil is in their dwellings and
in their midst. But I cried to God and the Lord heard me. At evening and morning
and at midday I shall speak and declare, and he will listen to my voice. He will
redeem my soul in peace from those who draw near me, for in crowds they were
about me. God will hear and he who is before the ages will humble them. For
there is no change with them, because they did not fear God; he stretched out
his hand to repay. They defiled his covenant; they were scattered at the wrath
of his presence, and their hearts drew near. His words were smoother than oil,
yet they are javelins. Cast your care on the Lord, and he will support you; he
will not let the righteous be storm-tossed for ever. But you, O God, will bring
them down to the pit of destruction. Men of bloodshed and deceit will not live
out half their days; but I, Lord, will hope in you.</p>
<b>
<p>Psalm 90<br>
</b>One who dwells in the help of the Most High will live under the protection
of the of the God of heaven. He will say to the Lord: you are my protector and
my refuge, my God, and I shall hope in him. For he will deliver you from the
snare of hunters, and from the word which troubles. He will overshadow you with
his wings, and beneath his feathers you will hope; his truth will encircle you
with a shield. You will not be afraid of terror by night, of the arrow that
flies by day. Of the thing that prowls in the darkness, of mishap and the
noonday devil. A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right,
but it will not come near you. But with your eyes you will observe, and see the
reward of sinners. For you, Lord, are my hope: you have made the Most High your
refuge. Evils will not approach you, nor a scourge draw near your dwelling.
Because he has given orders to his Angels about you, to guard you in all your
ways. They will bear you on their hands, lest you dash your foot against a
stone. You will walk on asp and basilisk, and trample down lion and dragon.
Because he hoped in me, I shall deliver him; I shall shelter him, because he
knew my name. He will cry to me, and I shall hear him, I am with him in trouble;
I shall rescue him and glorify him. I shall fill him with length of days, and
show him my salvation.</p>

<p>Psalm 83<br>
</font></b><font FACE="Book Antiqua">How beloved are your dwellings, O Lord of
powers; my soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my
flesh rejoiced in the living God. For the sparrow has found itself a house, and
the dove a nest for herself, where she may place her nestlings: your altars, O
Lord of powers, my King and my God. Blessed are those who dwell in your house,
they will praise you to ages of ages. Blessed the one whose help is from you;
who has placed ascents in his heart, to the valley of weeping, to the place he
has set. For the lawgiver will give blessings; they will go from strength to
strength, the God of gods will appear in Sion. Lord God of powers hear my
prayer, give ear, O God of Jacob. O God our shield see; and look on the face of
your Christ. For one day in your courts is far better than thousands. I chose to
be cast aside in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in the tents of
sinners. Lord God of powers, blessed is the one who hopes in you.</p>
<b>
<p>Psalm 84<br>
</b>You were well pleased with your land, O Lord, you turned away the captivity
of Jacob. You forgave your people their iniquities, you covered all their sins.
You made all your anger cease, you turned away from the anger of your rage. Turn
us back again, O God of our salvation, and turn away your rage from us. Would
you be angry with us for ever? Or will you prolong your wrath from generation to
generation? O God, when you have turned us back you will make us live, and your
people will rejoice in you. Lord, show us your mercy, and grant us your
salvation. I will hear what the Lord will say in me; for he will speak peace to
his people, to his holy ones, to those who turn their hearts back to him. But
his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth have met, righteousness and peace have kissed. Truth has dawned
from the earth, and righteousness has leaned down from heaven. For the Lord will
give goodness, and our earth will give its fruit. Righteousness will walk before
him, and set his steps in the way.</p>
<b>
<p>Psalm 85</b><br>
Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear me, for I am poor and needy. Guard my soul,
for I am holy; O my God, save your servant who hopes in you. Have mercy on me,
Lord, for I shall cry to you all the day; give joy to the soul of your servant,
for I have lifted up my soul to you. For you, O Lord, are good and gentle, and
full of mercy to all who call on you. Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; and attend
to the voice of my supplication. In the day of my trouble I called to you, for
you have heard me. There is none like you among the gods, O Lord; none whose
works are as yours. All the nations whom you made will come and bow down before
you, O Lord, and glorify your name. For you are great and do wondrous things;
you alone are God. Guide me, Lord, in your way, and I shall walk in your truth;
make my heart glad to fear your name. I shall give you thanks, O Lord, my God,
with my whole heart; and I shall glorify your name for ever. For your mercy is
great towards me, and you have delivered my soul from the lowest Hell. O God,
the lawless rose up against me, and an assembly of mighty ones sought my soul,
and did not set you before them. And you, Lord, are pitying and merciful,
long-suffering and full of mercy and true. Look on me and have mercy on me; give
your might to your servant and save the son of your maidservant. Make with me a
