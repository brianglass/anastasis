Virgin and the one who alone among women gave birth to God in the flesh without seed. For
the fire of Godhead dwelt in you, and you suckled as a babe the Creator and Lord.
Therefore the race of Angels and the human race fittingly glorifies your all-holy
child-bearing, and with one accord we cry out to you: Intercede with Christ God to grant
forgiveness of offences to those who fittingly worship your Offspring, O Immaculate.</font></p>

children of the Hebrews, truly ungrateful, hanged you unjustly upon a tree? But as you are
pitying you suffer all this in the flesh, my Son, long-suffering God, most merciful Lord,
as you have been well pleased, that you may deliver what you fashioned from the slavery of

sweet spices to the one who breathes life into all, now slain and lying in a tomb, holy

light has shone out, giving light to all who on it faithfully sing your praise, and

to me, O God of my salvation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">God who is beyond being when he dwelt in flesh in

Therefore you accomplished many healings, and now, having passed over, in heaven you
intercede at every moment on behalf of the world.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Christ the light of the world, seeing you the
vigilant eye of faith and the inseparable charm of love, honoured Saint, on rising from
the grave showed himself to you first, who had hastened with sweet spices and drawn near
to the unapproachable. He in return granted you the divine force of the Spirit and
revealed to you the design of his ascent to the Father who has no beginning. And he sent
you to proclaim the divine good tidings of his Rising to the Disciples, petrified with
fear. And so, as you have the greatest freedom to address him, you intercede at every
moment on behalf of the world.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">She was from Magdala in the regions of Syria. When
she approached Christ troubled by seven demons, she was delivered from them by
Christ&#146;s grace. Then she followed him until his Passion and was one of the
Myrrhbearers. She, with the &#145;other Mary&#146;, the most holy Mother of God, was the
first to behold the Resurrection, when she saw the Angel late on the Sabbath. In the
morning she saw two Angels sitting clothed in white, and then the Lord himself, whom she
thought was a gardener. From him she heard the words: Do not touch me. After the divine
and holy Ascension she came to Ephesus, to Saint John, the Apostle and Divine. There she
fell asleep in sanctity and was laid to rest at the entrance to the cave in which the
Seven Holy Youths slept. Later under Leo, who by blessed fortune had become our King, her
relics were translated by him and laid in the monastery of St Lazarus established by him,
in which her annual assembly is celebrated, and in the estate of Curator near the Taurus..</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Your way of life, O Magdalen, was resplendent
blazing with the beams of virtuous actions, of the divine proclamation and your
inclination to the divine, and with the bright rays of love for the Creator, to whom you
sing with the Angels: You priests, bless; you people, highly exalt to all the ages.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You stood by the Cross, glorious Mary, watching the
unjust slaughter of the one who emptied himself through ineffable mercy; and drenched with
groans and tears, you cried out: What is this strange wonder? How is he, who slew death
and who is life by nature, slain and dying?</font></p>
