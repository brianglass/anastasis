<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Canon to the Trinity,
of which the Acrostic is:</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">I praise you, O Trinity, nature that rules as one.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 1. Tone 7. By your will.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Open the spiritual mouth of my heart and my lips of matter to praise you, one Godhead
of triple light, and to sing you a song of thanksgiving, O Giver of light.</p>

<p>That you might show your surpassing goodness, O Trinity of infinite power, you
fashioned humankind, only image of clay of your sovereign lordship, O Creator.</p>

<p>The Mind without beginning, that begot the Word co-eternally and made the Spirit
likewise without beginning shine forth, has counted us worthy to worship one God by
essence, of one form, triple in persons.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You appeared in the bush to Moses, O Word of God, as a purifying fire that did not burn
up the whole, prefiguring your incarnation from the Virgin, through which you transformed
mortals.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 3. Lord, who in the beginning.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>As we praise you, O God of infinite power, as Master single and of triple light and
all-creating, we ask redemption from sins and temptations. Do not then despise those who
with faith glorify your loving-kindness.</p>

<p>A branch you appeared from the Father, as from a root without beginning, God the Word
and equal in strength with the Spirit of like nature and divine; and therefore we the
faithful glorify one Lordship, triple in persons.</p>

<p>All we the faithful glorify you, the nature in three persons, equal in glory, like in
nature, undivided and yet separated, Trinity that rule as one; and as we worship you we
ask pardon of offences.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Without change made like to mortals in all things, O Word of God, you came forth
clearly from a pure Maiden, and to all you revealed the Godhead of triple light and single
in the essence of identical hypostases.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Kathisma. For my sake you endured.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Have mercy, holy Trinity, on your servants who have sinned, and receive them, O
Compassionate, as they repent to you, and grant them pardon.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> Theotokion.<br>
The same.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Do good, all-pure Mother of God, to our souls that have been ruined by sins; and ransom
from faults those who sing your praise, O Bride of God.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 4. Christ God, who did not leave.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>O divine Unity of triple light, maintaining and saving all things, now watch over those
who sing your praise, save them from afflictions and passions and every distress.</p>

<p>At a loss for words that signify your incomprehensible Godhead of triple light, we sing
your praise, Lord, Lover of humankind, and we glorify your power.</p>

<p>On earth as in heaven with the choirs of Bodiless Powers without separating we separate
you, O Unity and Trinity, and with love we glorify you as sovereign over all things that
exist.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Without abandoning your Father&#146;s glory, you, the One beyond being, came down
willingly to our lowest estate and were incarnate, and you raised up all to divine glory
as you are compassionate.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 5. We who rise at dawn.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>O nature source of light, Trinity in persons and Unity in will and glory and honour,
strengthen us in love of you. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>As we glorify Mind, Word and Spirit, the one Divinity and nature with triple sun, we
ask to be delivered from temptations and afflictions of every kind.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>O Word of God, you received the form of human nature from a holy Virgin and you taught
us to sing the praise of a Trinity in Unity, identical in form and majesty.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 6. Sick on the rolling swell.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>We glorify the Deity that rules as one with might of equal glory, existing in three
persons identically with one another, having the difference only of each subsistent
property. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>The spiritual Ranks of the angelic orders praise you, sole Sovereignty with triple Sun.
With them we too with lips of clay sing out your praise as only Maker of all things and
with faith we glorify you.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Word, born from the Sun, the Father by an ineffable word as another Sun before the
ages, dawned in these last times from the Virgin and taught that God who is beyond
understanding is single in three persons.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Kathismata.<br>
More luminous than fire.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Consubstantial Trinity, three-personned Unity, have mercy on those you fashioned,
burning up, O Immortal, the vices of the those who fall and enlightening the hearts of
those who sing the praise of your compassion. Our God, glory to you.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> Theotokion. The same.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>More luminous than fire, more brilliant than light is the mercy of your grace,
Sovereign Lady. It burns up the sins of mortals and bedews the thoughts of those who sing
the praise of your mighty works, all-blameless Mother of God.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 7. Cast into the furnace of fire.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Obedient to the sayings of the godly Prophets, we glorify you the one and only God of
all things in three persons, as we cry out, Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our
Fathers. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>Along with immaterial Hosts we sing your praise with lips of dust, O holy Trinity in
unity of essence, as we cry aloud, Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our Fathers.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>That he that fashioned Adam might refashion him again, O all-pure, he became clearly
man from you, making humankind divine, that thus cries out, Blessed, O all-pure, is the
fruit of your womb.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 8. Unconsumed by fire.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Triple and single Lordship without beginning, you hold sway over the universe, you
direct heaven and earth. Therefore guard me, ever drawn by your love, to sing to you,
&#145;All you works of the Lord, praise the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the
ages&#146;.</p>

<p>Grant that the hearts of those who sing your praise may be flooded with the
light-giving beams of the Sun with triple light; and now, O Trinity and Unity, grant that
all they may ever behold your beauty, as far as is possible, who with fitting faith sing
the praise of your greatness to all the ages.</p>

<p>Make me a temple of your radiance with triple light, of communion and participation, O
Lover of humankind, source of good; show me, Master, sole Ruler, my God and Lord of glory,
to be unapproachable by invisible foes and passions of the flesh, that I may sing your
praise to all the ages.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>A divine light dawned from your womb, Virgin-mother all-pure, and flooded the whole
world with the light with triple sun; and revealed the earth to be as another Heaven that
sings, &#145;All you works of the Lord, praise the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the
ages&#146;.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 9. Mother of God and Virgin.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>We creatures of clay are not able fittingly to exalt and praise you, whom the Seraphim
praise unceasingly in the highest; but as Master of all things and as God who greatly love
humankind we dare to magnify you.</p>

<p>Single, undivided Trinity, be pleased to deliver from bodily pain and from passion of
soul those who sing your praise and to keep them unharmed from all the trials of life.</p>

<p>Godhead of triple light and equal might, putting before your might the unchanging
beauty of your natural loving-kindness, give to your servants release from faults and
redemption from temptations and passions.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Taking from your most pure womb, O Mother of God, mind and soul and the matter of his
flesh, God the Word appeared as truly a man and clearly showed humankind to be a partaker
in his godhead.</font> </p>
