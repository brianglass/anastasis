<p>She was from the city of Iconium; her mother was Theokleia of a noble and famous
family. She was instructed in the word of the faith by the great Apostle Paul, when he was
teaching in the house of Onesiphoros. When she came to the faith she was eighteen years
old and betrothed to one Thamyris. Despising the fire into which she was cast, and her
mother and her suitor, she followed Paul. After this, when at Antioch, she was condemned
to the beasts by Alexander and cast to the bulls to be torn apart; but Christ delivered
her from them all by his grace. She preached the Lord Jesus Christ in different cities and
brought many people to faith in Christ, finally she came to her own fatherland. There she
lived on one of the mountains and left this life, a rock opening up and receiving her. The
whole span of her life was ninety years.</font></p>

<p>He was born on a dung heap outside the monastery of the great Theodosios, the
Koinoviarch, of a woman who was being pursued by the Hagarenes with a large number of
others of the neighbourhood, who fled to the Saint for safety. After the passage of the
infidels the monks found the new born child on the dung-heap and, on the order of the
great Theodosios, they adopted him and named him Copris; he was nurtured on the milk of a
goat. When it reckoned that the time had come to suckle the child it would come down of
its own from the mountain, and after it had suckled him, it returned again. This it did
until the child was strong enough for stronger food.</p>

<p>When he had thus reached maturity he was well-loved by the great Theodosios; and so he
was worthy of the Holy Spirit, and having kept intact that which is according to the
image, he made wild beasts subject to him; for once finding a she-bear in the garden
eating the lettuces, he took it by the ear, and kept safe by the prayer of the great saint
led it outside. On another occasion he was going up the mountain with the donkey to
collect wood, as he used to do the collecting, when a she bear appeared and struck the
beast in the thigh. Copris seized the bear and loaded the wood onto it with the words:
&#145;I&#146;m not letting you go; for you&#146;ll do the donkey&#146;s service until it
gets well&#146;. And by the prayer of the great saint the bear was subject to him, and
carried the wood. Once when he was on duty in the kitchen the brass cauldron was boiling
over and the lentils were spilling out. Unable easily to find the usual stick of wood, he
plunged in his bare hand and stopped the boiling, and remained unharmed.</p>

<p>When he was ninety years old he shone among those Fathers like the sun, adorned with
priesthood and with every kind of virtue, and standing in a secret spot he would offer
prayers to the Lord, so that the great Theodosios, after his departure to the Lord, also
appeared going with him and chanting with him, and finally he said to him: &#145;See,
brother Copris, the time for your release has arrived; come to us in the place of rest
that has been prepared for you&#146;. When the admirable saint heard this, a few days
later he grew weak, and having greeted the Holy Fathers he departed in peace to the Lord.</font></p>

<p>The stadium of the contest lies before us to-day. Peoples, let us dance and let us
observe the wondrous deeds that are accomplished there; for a spotless lamb, the fair
virgin and bride of God Thekla is brought out for slaughter for the sake of Christ our God
who was slaughtered; and so by the faith of the Trinity she destroyed the godlessness of
tyrants and, as she dances with the Angels, she intercedes with the Saviour that our souls
may be saved.</font></p>

<p>Brave champion Thekla, with Christ as your Bridegroom in heaven, you despised your
earthly suitor; for wisely you did not yield to a mother&#146;s flatteries, but followed
Paul, taking on your shoulders the standard of the Cross. The fire did not harm you; you
changed the savagery of the wild beasts to tameness; you slew seals by the descent into
Christ that is holy Baptism. But, as you were distinguished by noble contests, do not
cease to intercede continually with the Lord for those who in faith celebrate your
ever-honoured memory.</font></p>

their rest. With them, Apostle Thekla, intercede for our souls.</font></p>

<p>Lovers of martyrs, strike up the dance, for the season of contests is upon us, and the

the victor and she intercedes with boldness for our souls.</p>

<p>Protomartyr of Christ, it was not only the races of mankind that marvelled but wild
beasts too were astonished. For you the flames were not reckoned as flames, fair virgin
Thekla, because of your Bridegroom Christ, for you were glad as you suffered for him and
were parted from the world that you might gain the blessedness of heaven as you intercede
with boldness for our souls.</p>

<p>Come, lovers of contests, let us honour with hymns Thekla, the Protomartyr, the boast
of women; for she trampled down the hostile adversary with the power of the Cross, and,
having won the victory, deserved her crown. And so the Champion implores that those who
celebrate with faith and love her memory may be delivered from dangers and from the
judgement to come.</p>
