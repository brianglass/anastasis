[</font><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">28:10-17</font><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>Jacob went out from the well of the oath and journeyed towards Harran. And he lighted
on a place and slept there, for the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of the
place and put it at his head; and he slept in that place, and he dreamed. And behold, a
ladder set up on the earth, whose head reached to heaven; and the Angels of God were going
up and going down upon it. But the Lord stood above it and said: &#145;I am the God of
Abraham, your father, and the God of Isaac, do not be afraid. The land on which you are
sleeping I shall give to you and to your seed. And your seed will be like the sand of the
earth, and it will be spread abroad to the Sea and Liva and North and East; and in you and
in your seed all the tribes of the earth will be blessed. And behold, I am with you,
guarding you on every road on which you may journey; and I shall bring you back again to
this land, because I shall never abandon you until I have done all that I have said to
you&#146;. And Jacob arose from his sleep and said: &#145;The Lord is in this place, but I
did not know it&#146;. And he was afraid, and said: &#145;How fearful is this place! This
is none other than the house of God, this is the gate of heaven&#146;.</p>

<p align="center">The Reading is from the Prophecy of Ezekiel.<br>
[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">43:72, 44:1</font><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>&#145;It shall be from the eighth day and upwards, the Priests shall make your
holocausts upon the altar, and those for your salvation; and I shall accept you&#146;,
says the Lord. And he turned me back by the way of the outer gate of the Holy Place, which
looks towards the east, and it was shut. And the Lord said to me: &#145;This gate shall be
shut, it shall not be opened, and no one shall pass through it, because the Lord, the God
of Israel, will enter through it, and it shall be shut. Therefore this prince shall sit in
it to eat bread. By the way of the Elam of the gate he shall enter, and by that way he
shall go out&#146;. And he brought me by the way of the gate towards the North, opposite
the House; and I saw, and behold the whole house of the Lord was full of glory. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from Proverbs.<br>
[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">9:1-11</font><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>Wisdom has built herself a house. She has slaughtered her beasts and mixed her wine in
the mixing bowl, and prepared her table. She her sent out her servants, to invite with a
loud proclamation upon the mixing bowl: &#145;Whoever is foolish, let him turn to
me&#146;. And to those who lack wisdom she said: &#145;Come, eat my bread, and drink the
wine that I have mixed for you. Abandon folly, and you will live; and seek understanding
that you may have life, and set aright your understanding with knowledge. One who corrects
the wicked will gain dishonour for himself. One who rebukes the impious will get blame for
himself; for to the impious rebukes are blows. Do not rebuke the wicked, lest they hate
you. Rebuke a wise man and he will love you. Give instruction to a wise man and he will be
wiser; teach a just man and he will increase learning. The beginning of wisdom is the fear
of the Lord, and the counsel of Saints, understanding. While to know the law is the part
of a good mind. For by this means you will live for a long time, and years will be added
to your life&#146;.</font></font></font></p>

<p>On the 15th of the month, commemoration of the all-revered Translation of our most

<font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Verses.<br>
</font><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4">No wonder that the Maiden, world&#146;s
salvation, dies,<br>
When the world&#146;s Fashioner in the flesh had died.<br>
God&#146;s Mother ever lives, though the fifteenth she died.</p>

<p>When Christ our God was well pleased to take to himself his own Mother, three days
before he told her through an Angel of her translation from the earth. It is the moment,
he said, to take my Mother to myself. Do not then be any way troubled by this, but accept
my word with joy, for you are coming to immortal life. And she, in her longing for her
translation to her Son, went up the mount of Olives with haste to pray (for it was her
custom to go up there to pray). Then there took place a marvel; for the plants on the
mount bowed themselves down of their own accord and like living slaves accomplished
fitting reverence to their Lady. After her prayer she returned home and at once the whole
house was shaken. She prepared many lights and having given thanks to God she invited her
relatives and neighbours. She swept the house and prepared the couch and everything needed
for the burial. She explained everything which had been told her by the Angel about her
translation to heaven and as confirmation of her words showed the reward that had been
given her, which was a palm branch [from Paradise]. But the women who had been summoned on
hearing this poured out lamentations and tears and lamented with cries of grief. When they
ceased their lament they begged her not to leave them orphans. She assured them that when
she had passed over she would watch over and protect not only them but the whole world.
Much of their grief was assuaged by these words of consolation which she spoke to the
bystanders. Then she gave instructions about her two tunics, that the two poor widows who
were customarily with her and known to her and who received from her what was required for
their nourishment should take one each.</p>

<p>While she was detailing and arranging this, there suddenly came the sound of mighty
thunder and the arrival of many clouds from the ends of the earth bringing Christ&#146;s
disciples together to the house of God&#146;s Mother. Among them also were the Hierarchs,
wise in God, Denys the Areopagite, Hierothoes and Timothy. When they learned the reason of
their presence together they spoke to her as follows: While we saw you, Lady, remaining in
the world, like our Master and Teacher himself, we were comforted; but how shall we now
bear the suffering? But since by the wish of your Son and God you are passing over to the
regions beyond the world, we rejoice for the things that have been so disposed for you. As
they said this they wept profusely. But she answered them: Friends and Disciples of my Son
and God, do not turn my joy to sorrow, but bury my body just as I have arranged it on the
bed.</p>

<p>When these things had been completed, Paul the inspired vessel of election arrived. He
fell at the feet of God&#146;s Mother, worshipped and opening his mouth uttered a great
eulogy of her, saying: Hail, Mother of life and subject of my preaching. For though I
never saw Christ, in seeing you I seem to see him. Then the Virgin took leave of all. She
lay down on the bed and arranged her all-pure body as she wished. She prayed for the
conservation of the world and for peaceful life. She filled them too with blessing through
her, and so committed her spirit into the hands of her own Son and God.</p>

<p>At this Peter began the funeral hymns. The rest of the Apostles took up the bier and
accompanied the body that had received God to the grave, some going in front with lamps
and hymns, others following behind. At this the rulers of the Jews stirring up some of the
crowd persuaded them to try to upset the bier on which the life-giving body had been
placed and to throw it to the ground. But already punishment came upon those who dared
such things, and they were all smitten with blindness. One of them, who attempting even
greater folly had touched the sacred bier, was deprived of both his insolent hands. They
were severed by the sword of punishment and left hanging from the bier. He remained a
pitiable sight until, after he had come to belief with his whole heart and found healing,
he was restored to health as before. So too part of the covering of the bier, when placed
on those who had been blinded and come to belief, gave them healing. When the Apostles
reached Gethsemane they laid the live-giving body in the grave and remained there for
three days responding to the unceasing voices of the Angels.</p>

<p>But when, by divine dispensation, one of the Apostles, who had been absent from the
burial of the life-giving body, arrived on the third day, he was greatly grieved and
distressed that he had not been found worthy of what they had. All his fellow Apostles,
who had been found worthy, by a common vote opened the tomb for the sake of the Apostle
who had been absent, so it seemed good to all, for him also to venerate that all-blameless
body. When they looked they were amazed. For they found it empty of the holy body, and
containing only the winding sheet, which remained as a consolation for those who were
about to grieve and for all the faithful, and as a sure witness of the Translation. For
even until today the tomb hewn from the rock is visible and venerated, and remains empty
of a body, to the glory and honour of our most blessed Lady, Mother of God and ever-virgin
Mary.</p>

mankind.</font></p>

childbirth have joined together things on earth with those on high.</p>

<p>Virgin Mother, Bride of God, who gave birth to life, you have passed over to immortal
life by your revered Falling Asleep. Angels, Rulers and Powers, Apostles, Prophets and all
creation escorted you, and your Son received in his immaculate hands your unblemished
soul.</p>

<p>At your immortal Falling Asleep, O Mother of God, Mother of life, clouds caught the
Apostles up into the air; and though they were scattered through the world, made them form
a single choir in the presence of your immaculate body. As they reverently buried you they
sang Gabriel&#146;s song, crying out: &#145;Hail, full of grace, Virgin Mother without
bridegroom, the Lord is with you&#146;. With them implore him as your Son and our God that
our souls may be saved.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">A good word, Alleluia.</p>

<p>My heart has uttered a good Word. I tell my works to the King.</p>

<p>My tongue is the pen of ready writer, You are lovely with a beauty beyond the sons of
men.</p>

<p>Grace has poured from your lips, therefore God has blessed you for ever.</p>

<p>Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty warrior, in your splendour and beauty.</p>

<p>Draw your bow and prosper and reign in the cause of truth and meekness and justice, and
your right hand will guide you wonderfully.</p>

<p>Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the sceptre of your Kingdom is a rod of
justice.</p>

<p>You have loved right and hated wrong, therefore God your God has anointed you with the
oil of gladness beyond your fellows.</p>

<p>Your garments are fragrant with myrrh, aloes and cassia, from the ivory palaces which
gladden you.</p>

<p>Kings&#146; daughters are in your train. The Queen stood at your right hand arrayed in
gold wrought with many colours.</p>

<p>Listen my daughter and see, and incline your ear, and forget your people and your
father&#146;s house.</p>

<p>Then the King will desire your beauty, for he is your God and your shall worship him.</p>

<p>And the daughter of Tyre will worship you with gifts; the richest of the people will
entreat your favour.</p>

<p>All the glory of the King&#146;s daughter is within, though she is arrayed in tasselled
gold wrought with many colours.</p>

<p>The virgins in her train will be brought to the King; those near her will be brought to
you.</p>

<p>They will be brought with joy and gladness; they will be led into the King&#146;s
temple.</p>

<p>Instead of your fathers, sons are born to you. You shall make them rulers over all the
earth.</p>

<p>I will remember your name throughout all generations, therefore people will praise and
thank you for ever and ever.</font></p>
