<p>As you sojourn on earth, my soul, repent; dust in tomb does not sing hymns,
is not delivered from faults; cry out to Christ God: Knower of hearts, I have
sinned; before you condemn me, spare me, O God, and have mercy on me.</p>

do not rebuke me in your anger; nor chastise me in your wrath.</p>

delay repentance? Call to mind the judgement to come, cry out to Christ God:
Knower of hearts, I have sinned; sinless Lord, have mercy on me!</p>

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>At the dread assize, without accusers I am convicted, without witnesses I am
condemned; for the books of the conscience are opened, and hidden deeds are
disclosed; then before you are to examine my actions in that most public

<p>You have become a divine tabernacle of the Word, O Virgin Mother, alone pure,

compassion.</p>

<p>You appeared as burning coals, wise Athletes, reducing to ashes the fuel of
godlessness, and leading those in darkness to the light.</p>

squandered your long-suffering, wretch that I am, yet still I remain unfeeling:

received your crowns.</p>
