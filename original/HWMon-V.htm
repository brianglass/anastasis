<p>Psalm 103</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you have been
greatly magnified. You have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping
yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his
upper chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind,
making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its
sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle;
waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at
the voice of your thunder. The mountains rise and the plains descend to the place which
you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return
to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the
mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await
them to quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling:
and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will
be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green
herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the
human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human heart.
The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There
the sparrows will build their nests; the heron&#146;s dwelling is at their head. The high
mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the
seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night,
in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to
seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they will lie
down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How
your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth
has been filled with your creation. Also this great, wide sea; there there are creeping
things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go to and fro; this
dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to you to give them their food
in due season. When you give it them, they will gather it. When you open your hand all
things will be filled with goodness. But when you turn away your face they will be
troubled. You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust.
You will send forth your spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of
the earth. May the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his
works. He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they
smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. May my
words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners
might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no more. Bless the Lord, my
soul!</font></p>

<p>When I was afflicted I called to the Lord, and he heard me. O Lord, deliver my soul
from unjust lips and from a deceitful tongue. What should be given you, what added to you
for a treacherous tongue? The sharpened arrows of the powerful, with the coals of
desolation. Alas! For my sojourning has been prolonged, I have camped among the
encampments of Kedar. My soul has long been a sojourner. With those who hate peace I was
peaceable. When I spoke with them, they made war on me for nothing.</font></p>

<p>I rejoiced at those who said to me, &#145;We shall go to the house of the Lord&#146;.
Our feet were standing in your courts, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem built as a city, shared by
all together. For there the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, a testimony for
Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord. For there thrones were set for judgement,
thrones over the house of David. Ask then for the things which are for Jerusalem&#146;s
peace, and prosperity for those who love you. May there be peace then in your power and
prosperity in your citadels. For the sake of my brethren and neighbours, I have spoken
peace concerning you. For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I have sought good

upright in heart. But the Lord will drive away with those who work iniquity, those who
turn aside to extortions. Peace upon Israel.</font></p>

comforted. Then our mouth was filled with joy, and our tongue with rejoicing. Then they

has done great things with us, we have become joyful. Turn back our captivity, O Lord,

does not guard the city, the guard has kept vigil for nothing. Your getting up at dawn is
for nothing, your rising after sitting, you that eat the bread of sorrow, when he gives
sleep to those he loves, see, sons are the Lord&#146;s inheritance, the reward of the
fruit of the womb. As arrows in the hand of a powerful man, so are the sons of the

<p>These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob their father,
each with all his household: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Juda, Issachar, Zabulon, Benjamin,
Dan and Nephtalim, Gad and Aser. Joseph was already in Egypt. The total number of people
born to Jacob was seventy-five. Then Joseph died, and all his brothers, and that whole
generation. But the Israelites were fruitful and prolific; they multiplied and grew
exceedingly strong, so that the land was filled with them. Now a new king arose over
Egypt, who did not know Joseph. He said to his people, &#145;Look, the Israelite people
are more numerous and more stronger than we are. Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or
they will increase and, in the event of war, join our enemies and fight against us and
escape from the land.&#146; Therefore they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with
forced labour. They built supply cities, Pitho, Rameses and On, which is Helioupolis, for
Pharao. But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and grew stronger, so
that the Egyptians came to abominate the Israelites. The Egyptians became ruthless in
imposing tasks on the Israelites, and made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar
and brick and in every kind of field labor. They were ruthless in all the tasks that they
imposed on them. The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named
Sephora and the other Phua, &#145;When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women, and they
are about to give birth, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, spare her.&#146;
But the midwives feared God; they did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but they
let the boys live. So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, &#145;Why
have you done this, and allowed the boys to live?&#146; The midwives said to Pharao,
&#145;Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they give birth before
the midwives comes to them.&#146; So God dealt well with the midwives; and the people
multiplied and became very strong.</p>

[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">1:1-12</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>There was once a man in the land of Ausis whose name was Job. That man was blameless,
just and true, one who feared God and turned away from every evil deed. There were born to
him seven sons and three daughters. He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels,
five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she asses in pasture and very many servants, and
great works of husbandry on the earth; so that this man was the greatest of all the people
of the east. His sons used to go and hold feasts in one another&#146;s houses in turn each
day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. And
when the feast days had run their course, Job would send and purify them, and he would
rise early in the morning and offer sacrifices according to the number of them all; and a
calf for a sin-offering for their souls. For Job said, &#145;It may be that my children
have thought evil against God in their hearts.&#146; This is what Job always did. One day
the angels of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the devil also came
among them. The Lord said to the devil, &#145;Where have you come from?&#146; The devil
answered the Lord, &#145;From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down
under heaven.&#146; The Lord said to the devil, &#145;Have you considered my servant Job?
There is no one like him on the earth, a man blameless, just and true who fears God and
turns away from every evil deed.&#146; Then the devil answered the Lord, &#145;Does Job
reverence God for nothing? Have you not put a fence around him and his house and all that
he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his cattle have
increased in the land. But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he
will indeed bless you to your face.&#146; The Lord said to the devil, &#145;Very well, all
that he has is in your power; only do not touch!&#146; So the devil went out from the
presence of the Lord.</font></p>

<p>At that time, as Jesus was sitting on the mount of Olives, his disciples approached him
privately, saying, &#145;Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your
coming and of the end of the age?&#146; Jesus answered them, &#145;See that no one leads
you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, &#145;I am the Christ!&#146; and they
will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumours of wars; see that you are not
alarmed; for all this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and plagues and
earthquakes in various places: all this is but the beginning of woes. Then they will hand
you over to affliction and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations
because of my name. Then many will fall away, and they will betray one another and hate
one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because of the
increase of lawlessness, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the
end will be saved. And this Gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the
inhabited world, as a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come. So when
you see the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place, as was spoken of by the
prophet Daniel (let the reader understand), then let those in Judea flee to the mountains;
the one on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house; the one in the field not
turn back to get his clothes. Woe to those who are with child and to those who are nursing
infants in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on Sabbath. For at
that time there will be great suffering, such as has not been from the beginning of the
world until now, no, and never will be. And if those days had not been cut short, no one
would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. Then if anyone
says to you, &#145;See! Here is the Christ!&#146; or &#145;There he is!&#146; &#151; do
not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will appear and produce great signs
and omens, to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand.
So, if they say to you, &#145;See! He is in the wilderness,&#146; do not go out. See! He
is in the inner rooms,&#146; do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east
and appears as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever the
corpse is, there the eagles will gather. Immediately after the suffering of those days the
sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from
heaven, and the powers of heaven will be shaken. Then the sign of the Son of Man will
appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the
Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out
his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds,
from one end of heaven to the other. From the fig tree learn the parable: as soon as its
branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. So also,
when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very doors. Amen I say to
you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place. Heaven
and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</font></p>

let us exalt his name together. I sought the Lord and he heard me, and he delivered me
from all my afflictions. Draw near to him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be
ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him from all his
afflictions. The angel of the Lord will encamp round those who fear him, and deliver them.
Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed the man who hopes in him! Fear the Lord, all
you his saints, for there is not want for those who fear him. The rich became have become
poor and gone hungry, but those who seek the Lord will not be deprived of any good. Come,
my children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Who is there who wants
life, who loves to see good days? Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking
guile. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are
on the just, and his ears towards their supplication. The Lord sets his face against those
who do evil, to destroy their memory from the earth. The just cried and the Lord heard
them, and delivered them from all their afflictions. The Lord is close to those who are
broken-hearted, and he will save the humble in spirit. The afflictions of the just are
many, but the Lord will deliver them from them all. The Lord guards all their bones; not
one of them will be broken. The death of sinners is evil. Those who hate the just will go
astray. The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants, and none who hope in him will go
astray.</p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>I will exalt you, my God, my King; and I will bless your name for ever and to age on
age. Every day I will bless you; and praise your name for ever and to age on age. The Lord
is great and highly to be praised; and there is no limit to his greatness. Generation
after generation will praise your works; and will declare your power. They will tell of
the majesty of the glory of your holiness; and will recount your wonders. They will speak
of the power of your dread deeds; and will recount your greatness. They will proclaim the
memory of the multitude of your goodness; and rejoice in your justice. The Lord is
compassionate and merciful; long-suffering and full of mercy. The Lord is good to all; and
his acts of compassion are for all his works. May all your works confess you, Lord; and
all your holy ones bless you. They will speak of the glory of your kingdom; and tell of
your power. To make known your power and of the glory the majesty of your kingdom to the
children of mankind. Your kingdom is a kingdom for all the ages, and your dominion for
every generation. The Lord is faithful in all his words, and holy in all his works. The
Lord supports all who are falling, and sets upright all who are broken down. The eyes of
all hope in you, and you give them their food in due season. You open your hand, and fill
every living thing with your good pleasure. The Lord is just in all his ways, and holy in
all his works. The Lord is close to those who call on him, to all who call on him in
truth. He will do the will of those who fear him, and hear their supplication and save
them. The Lord guards all who love him, and all sinners he will destroy. My mouth will
tell the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and to age on
age.</font></p>
