<p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5">INTRODUCTION</font></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Among the many metrical texts in Greek
attributed to Saint Ephrem the Syrian are a number of long poems devoted to Old Testament
figures. The one presented here is particularly interesting since it is clearly related to
a text of Saint Gregory of Nyssa <strong><em>On the Nature of the Son</em></strong>, which
may be found in PG 46:565-576. In the translation below the parts that are identical with
St Gregory&#146;s are underlined. It is very difficult to decide which text is the earlier
and the few few scholars who have given any attention to the subject are divided. I am
inclined to think that St Gregory&#146;s text is the earlier, since it includes none of
the passages in St Ephrem&#146;s text which are explicitly Christological; for example the
long typological series of stanzas (9 to 27) on the Incarnation, or that on Isaac and
Christ (94 to 106). Whether the poem has links to the Syrian Ephrem is another very
difficult question. The description of the tree on which the ram is found hanging as </font><font face="Book Antiqua"><big><span face="Book Antiqua" size="4">&#146;</span></big></font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">a Sabek plant</font><font face="Book Antiqua"><big><span face="Book Antiqua" size="4">&#146;</span></big></font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">
must be based on the Septuagint, on the other hand the idea that the tree and the ram were
a special miraculous creation is also found in St Ephrem</font><font face="Book Antiqua"><big><span face="Book Antiqua" size="4">&#146;</span></big></font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">s
own Syriac Commentary on Genesis, </font><span face="Book Antiqua" size="4"><big><font face="Book Antiqua">&#146;The ram had not been there, since Isaac asked about the lamb.
The tree was not there, since the wood on&nbsp; Isaac&#146;s shoulders shows it. The
mountain threw up the tree, and the tree the ram; so that by the ram which was hanging
from the tree and became a sacrifice for Abraham&#146;s son, might be prefigured the one
who hung like a ram from the wood, and who would taste death for the whole world&#146;.</font></big>
<big>[<strong><em><font face="Book Antiqua">On Genesis,</font> </em></strong>20.1]</p>
</big>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua"><big>The description of the moment of the
sacrifice, stanzas 133 to 139, is,as the writer says, based on actual depictions of the
scene and is reminicscent of extant examples from early Christian art, among them a number
of sarcophagi.</big></font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua"><big>The poem is written in the Syrian metre,
known as the &#146;Metre of Mar Eprem&#146;, which consists of lines of fourteen
syllables, with a caesura after the seventh. These are sometimes printed as couplets of
seven syllable lines. This is unknown in Greek prosody and is based neither on length of
syllabes, as in Classical Greek, nor on patterns of stress accents, as in Byzantine
poetry, but simply on the number of syllables. Greek Ephrem also uses on occasion
octosyllabic lines, made up of two tetrasyllables. In this poem they are used for
Sara&#146;s Lament in stanzas 76&nbsp; to 92.</big></font></span></p>
<span face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua"><big>The text is translated from the critical
edition by Mercati. I have, for the moment, accepted his division into four line stanzas,
though involves accepting that there some lacunae in the original.</big></font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua"><big>The whole of the Greek text is also found
among the (inauthentic) sermons of St John Chrysostom.</big></font></p>

    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">While God was pleased<br>
      by the single choice<br>
      of holy Abraham,<br>
      who had proved most faithful.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">And he said to him, Blessing I will bless<br>
      and multiplying I will multiply<br>
      your descendants upon earth<br>
      like the stars of heaven,<br>
      </font><br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Since you have eagerly<br>
      obeyed my voice<br>
      and hastened to fulfil<br>
      my commandment.&#146;<br>
      </font></span><br>
    </li>
    <span face="Book Antiqua" size="4">
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">And God gave<br>
      a sheep from the rock<br>
      instead of the child<br>
      to complete the sacrifice.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">For God is not pleased<br>
      by a dead sacrifice<br>
      offered to him<br>
      through ash and smoke,<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">But a living sacrifice,<br>
      holy, well-pleasing,<br>
      the reasonable worship<br>
      he seeks from us,<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">As the Apostle<br>
      clearly exhorts us all,<br>
      knowing that this<br>
      is well-pleasing to God.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">For God did not wish<br>
      to make Abraham<br>
      a child murderer<br>
      when he told him to offer his son,<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">But so that he might show all<br>
      the inhabitants of the world<br>
      that Abraham loved<br>
      God very greatly,<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Because for his sake<br>
      he did not spare Isaac <br>
      although he was<br>
      his only child.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">And so too God<br>
      revealed a mystery,<br>
      great and marvellous,<br>
      to his friend Abraham.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">For through the sacrifice<br>
      he became a priest;<br>
      while by the type<br>
      he made him a prophet.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">And God Most High<br>
      made known to him<br>
      that he too would<br>
      give his only Son<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">For the world&#146;s sake,<br>
      so that God become man<br>
      might save the human<br>
      race from error.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">For this he signified<br>
      in giving in place of Isaac<br>
      a sheep from the Sabek<br>
      to become the sacrifice.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">For since disbelieving men<br>
      would not believe<br>
      in the child-bearing<br>
      of the Holy Virgin<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">&#151; How could she have<br>
      without marriage to a man<br>
      given birth a son;<br>
      something truly impossible &#151;<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Therefore he brought<br>
      the ram from a rock<br>
      that by this means<br>
      the marvel might be assured,<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Because everything<br>
      that is ordained<br>
      by the will of his divinity<br>
      is instantly realised.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">So, as there the word<br>
      brought a sheep into being,<br>
      so in the Virgin<br>
      the Word became flesh.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">And as the sheep<br>
      was bound to the plant,<br>
      so the Only-Begotten<br>
      was nailed to a Cross.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Therefore Isaias<br>
      cried out and said,<br>
      &#145;He was led like a sheep<br>
      silent to the slaughter.&#146;<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">While again the Lord<br>
      said to the Jews,<br>
      &#145;Abraham desired<br>
      to see my day,<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">He both saw it and rejoiced,&#146;<br>
      the day that is of the Passion<br>
      typified by Isaac<br>
      on the holy mountain.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Blessed is God<br>
      who foreshadowed for us<br>
      all our salvation<br>
      in the holy scriptures.<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">And he came and fulfilled<br>
      the words of the Prophets,<br>
      and ascended in glory<br>
      to his Father,<br>
      </font><br>
    </li>
    <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">That in every place<br>
      we may worship the Father<br>
      with Son and Spirit<br>
      to the ages. Amen.</font></li>
