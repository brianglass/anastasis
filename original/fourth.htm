<p>Thus says the Lord Sabaoth: In the way that I have spoken, thus shall it be, and in the
way I have planned, thus shall it remain, to destroy the Assyrians on my land and from my
mountains, and they will be for trampling down and their yoke shall be taken from them and
their glory shall be taken from their shoulders. This is the plan which the Lord has
planned against the whole inhabited world, and this is the hand that is uplifted against
all the nations. For what the holy God has planned, who will scatter it? And will turn
away his uplifted hand? In the year that King Achaz died there came this word. Do not
rejoice, all you foreigners, that the yoke of the one who struck you is broken, for from a
serpent&#146;s seed there will come a race of vipers, and their offspring will come forth
flying serpents. And the poor will be pastured through him and paupers will rest in peace.
But he will destroy your seed by famine and your remnant he will destroy. Howl, gates of
cities, and let troubled cities cry out, all the foreigners, because smoke is coming from
the North and there is no possibility of being. And what will the kings of the nations
answer? That the Lord has founded Sion and through him the humble of the people will be
saved.</p>

all living flesh as I have done. During all the days of the earth seed-time and harvest,

that move on the earth and on all the fishes of the sea. I have put them under your hands.

<p>A righteous son is born for life, but the persecution of the ungodly is for death.
Perverted ways are an abomination to the Lord, but all who are blameless in their ways are
acceptable to him. One who with the hand strikes hands unjustly will not be unpunished,
but one who sows justice will receive faithful recompense. Like a ear ring in a pig&#146;s
snout is beauty in a ill-minded woman. Every desire of the just is good, but the hope of
the ungodly will perish. There are those who sow abroad their own possessions and make
them more, but there are those who gather them in and are diminished. Every simple soul is
blessed, but a passionate man is not noble. May the one that hoards corn leave it for the
nations, but blessing be on the head of one who shares. One who devises good things seeks
good grace, one who seeks out wicked ones, they will seize him. One who trusts in wealth
is the one who will fall, but one who helps the righteous is the one who will rise. One
who does not deal graciously with their own household will inherit wind, but the senseless
will serve the wise. From the fruit of justice grows a tree of life, but the souls of
transgressors are cut off unripe. If the just is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly
and the sinner appear? [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">12,1</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">] One who loves instruction loves sense, but one who hates
rebukes is a fool. Better one who has found grace from the Lord, but a man who is a
transgressor will be passed over in silence. A person will not succeed through
transgression, but the roots of the righteous will not be pulled up. A courageous woman is
a crown for her husband; but like a worm in wood, so a wife who does evil destroys her
husband. The thoughts of the righteous are judgements, but the ungodly devise deceits. The
words of the ungodly are deceitful, but the mouth of the upright will deliver them.</font></p>

from birds and beasts, and with all the wild animals of the earth, as many as are with you
from all those who came out of the ark; and I will establish my covenant with you, and all
flesh shall not die from the water of the flood and there shall not again be a flood to
destroy the whole earth. And the Lord God said to Noë, This is the sign of the covenant,
the sign that I setting between me and you and between every living soul which is with you
for eternal generations. I am placing my bow in the cloud and it will be a sign of
covenant between me and the earth. And it shall be when I gather together the clouds upon
the earth that my bow shall appear in the cloud. And I shall remember my covenant, which

<p>The mouth of one with understanding is praised by a man, but the dull of heart is held
in derision. Better a man in dishonour who is a slave to himself than one who surrounds
himself with honour and lacks bread. A just man has pity on the souls of his beasts, but
the bowels of the ungodly are without mercy. One who works his own land will be filled
with bread, but those who pursue vanities lack sense. One whose pleasure is in banquets of
wine will leave behind dishonour in his own strongholds. The desires of the ungodly are
wicked, but the roots of the godly are strongly set. Through sin of the lips the sinner
falls into snares, but the just escapes them. One who looks with gentleness will find
mercy, but one who is contentious in the gates will afflict souls. From fruits of the
mouth the soul of a man will be filled with blessings, but the recompense of his lips will
be given him. The ways of fools are right in their own eyes, but the wise listen to
advice. A fool announces his anger the same day, but a prudent man hides his own
dishonour. The just declares open trust, but the witness of the unjust is deceitful. There
are those who wound with a sword when they speak, but the tongues of the wise heal. True
lips establish testimony, but a hasty witness has an unjust tongue. There is deceit in the
heart of one who imagines wickedness, but those who wish for peace will rejoice. Nothing
unjust pleases a just man, but the ungodly are filled with evils. Lying lips are an
abomination to the Lord, but one who acts faithfully is accepted by him.</font></p>

<p>These are the sons of Noë, who came out of the ark, Sem, Cham and Iapheth; Cham was
the father of Canaan. These are the three sons of Noë; from these were men scattered over
all the earth. And Noë began to be a farmer of the land, and he planted a vine; and he
drank of the wine and became drunk and lay naked in his house. And Cham the father of
Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and went out and told his two brothers outside. And
Sem and Iapheth took a garment and put it on both their backs and walked backwards and
covered up the nakedness of their father; and with their face backwards they did not see
the nakedness of their father. But Noë awoke from the wine and realized what his younger
son had done and he said, Canaan is accursed; he shall a servant boy to his brothers. And
he said, &#145;Blessed is Sem, and Canaan shall be his servant boy. May God broaden

<p>A man of understanding is a throne of perception, but the heart of fools will encounter
curses. The hand of chosen ones will easily obtain might, but the deceitful will be for
prey. A fearful word troubles the heart of the just, but a good message makes him glad. A
just arbitrator will his own friend, but the opinions of the ungodly are unfair. Evils
will pursue those who sin, while the way of the ungodly will lead them astray. The
deceitful will catch no wild game, but a pure man is a precious possession. In ways of
righteousness is life, but ways of those who remember wrongs lead to death. [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">13:1</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]
A clever son is obedient to his father, but a disobedient son is for destruction. The good
eats from the fruits of justice, but the souls of transgressors perish unripe. One who
guards his mouth will preserve his own soul, but one that has hasty lips will terrify
himself. Every idle person lives in desires, but the hands of the brave are diligent. The
just hates an unjust word, but the ungodly is put to shame and will not have boldness to
speak. Justice guards the innocent, while sin makes the impious worthless. There are those
who enrich themselves, though they have nothing, and there are those who humble themselves
amid great wealth. His own wealth is a ransom of a man&#146;s life, but the poor does not
undergo threatening. There is always light for the just, but light is quenched for the
ungodly. Deceitful souls go astray in sins, but the just show pity and mercy.</font></p>

<p>These are tribes of the sons of Noë according to their generations, according to their
nations. From these the islands [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">This
word is not in the Hebrew</font><font FACE="Goudy Old Style" SIZE="4">.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">] of the nations were scattered on the earth after the flood.
[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">11,1</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">] And the whole earth was of one tongue and one language. And
it came to pass as they moved from the east that they found a plain in the land of Senaar
and they dwelt there. And they said to one another, &#145;Come, let us make bricks and
bake them in fire&#146;. And brick became as stone for them, and bitumen as mortar. And
they said, &#145;Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, whose top will reach to
haven, and let us make a name for ourselves before we are scattered over the face of the
whole earth. And the Lord God came down to see the city and the tower which the children
of men had built. And the Lord said, &#145;See, they are all one race and one tongue, and
they have begun to do this, and now nothing of all that they want to do will fail. Come,
let us go down and confound their speech there, so that each one may not understand their
neighbour&#146;s language.&#146; And the Lord God scattered them from there over the face
of the whole earth. And they stopped building the city and the tower. And so its name was
called &#145;Confusion&#146;, because it was there that the Lord God confounded the
tongues of the whole earth, and it was from there that the Lord God scattered them over
the face of the whole earth.</p>

<p>The desires of the godly delight the soul, but the works of the ungodly are far from
knowledge. One who walks with the wise will be wise, but one who walks with fools will be
known. Evils will pursue those who sin, but good things will overtake the just. A good man
will inherit children&#146;s children, but the wealth of the ungodly will be laid up for
the just. The just will spend many years in wealth, but the unjust will perish suddenly.
One who spares his own rod hates his own child, but one who loves chastens it with care. A
just person eats and satisfies their soul, but the souls of the ungodly are in want. [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">14,1</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]
Wise women build houses, but the foolish one razes them to the ground with her own hands.
One who walks uprightly fears the Lord, but one who is crooked in his ways will be
dishonoured. From the mouth of fools comes a rod of pride, but the lips of the wise will
guard them. Where there are no oxen, the mangers are clean; but where there is much
produce, the strength of the ox is manifest. A faithful witness will not lie, but an
unjust witness kindles lies. You will look for wisdom from the wicked and not find it, but
from the prudent knowledge is easy.</font></p>

<p>Thus says the Lord, This people draws near me with their mouth and honour me with their
lips, but their heart is far away from me, and in vain they honour me, teaching the
commands and teachings of men. Therefore, behold, I will proceed to remove this people,
and I will remove them and I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and conceal the
understanding of those who understand. Woe to those who make their counsel deep and not by
the Lord. Woe to those who make their counsel in secret, whose deeds are in the dark, and
who will say, &#145;Who has seen us? Who will know us, or what we do?&#146; Will you not
be reckoned as potter&#146;s clay? Will what is fashioned say to the one who fashions it,
&#145;You did not fashion me&#146;? Or the thing made should say to its maker, &#145;You
did not make me wisely&#146;? Is it not yet a little while and Lebanon shall be changed
like the mountain of Chermel, and Chermel be reckoned as a forest? In that day the deaf
will hear the words of a book, and those in darkness and the eyes of the blind in the mist
will see. The poor will rejoice with gladness because of the Lord, and those without hope
among men will be filled with gladness. The lawless has failed and the proud has perished
and those who transgress wickedly have been destroyed and those who make people sin by
word, and they will make those who reprove in the gates a stumbling block, because they
have unjustly perverted the just. Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the house of
Jacob, whom he set apart out of Abraham, &#145;Jacob will not now be ashamed, nor will
Israel change his countenance. But when their children see my works, for my sake they will
hallow my name and hallow the Holy One of Jacob and fear the God of Israel.</p>

<p>The Lord said to Abram, &#145;Go from your country and your kindred and your
father&#146;s house to the land that I will show you. And I will make you a great nation,
and I will bless you, and make your name great, and you will be blessed. I will bless
those who bless you, and those who curse you I will curse; and in you all the tribes of
the earth will be blessed.&#146; So Abram went, as the Lord God had told him; and Lot went
with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Charan. And Abram took
Sara his wife, and Lot his brother&#146;s son, and all their possessions which they had
gathered, and every person that they had gathered in Charan; and they set out to go to the
land of Canaan. And Abram journeyed through the length of the land to the place at
Shechem, to the high oak. At that time the Canaanites inhabited the land. And the Lord
appeared to Abram, and said to him, &#145;To your descendants I will give this land.&#146;
So he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him.</p>

<p>The simple believes every word, but the prudent goes to repentance. The wise fears and
has turned away from evil, but the fool trusting in himself mixes with the ungodly. A
person of quick temper acts thoughtlessly, but a prudent one bears many things. Fools will
have wickedness as their portion, but the prudent will take hold of understanding. The
evil will bow before the good, the impious will serve at the gates of the just. Friends
will hate poor friends, but the rich has many friends. One who dishonours paupers commits
sin, but one who has mercy on the poor is blessed. Those who go astray devise evils, but
the good devise mercy and truth. Devisers of evils do not know mercy, but acts of mercy
and faithfulness are with the devisers of good. With everyone who cares there is
abundance, but the pleasure seeker and the callous will be in want. The crown of the wise
is their wealth, but occupation of fools is wicked. A faithful witness will deliver a soul
from evils, but a trickster kindles lies. In the fear of the Lord is hope of strength,
while he leaves to his children a support of peace.</font></p>
