<p>The Patriarch Germanos the Younger collected together in one Canon the seven Councils
of the Fathers, which had taken place at different times, excellently writing together and
strengthening their teachings; he also presents them to the Lord as unsleeping advocates
of salvation and fellow-shepherds of the flock.</p>

<p>The letter of the Law laid down for the children of the Hebrews that the heptad was to
be honoured, and they devoted themselves to a shadow and reverenced it. But you, O
Fathers, came together in a heptad of Councils, at the behest of God, who fashioned the
universe in a hexad of days and blessed the seventh, and you made the heptad even more
honourable by laying down a definition of the Faith.</p>

<p>Thrice-blessed Fathers, you have handed down that the Trinity is the cause of the birth
of the world for all things that are created; for with mystic reason you established three
and four Councils, and you appeared as champions of orthodox reason, for you showed that
while there are four elements, it is the Trinity which created them and made the world.</p>

<p>It would have been sufficient for the Prophet Elisaius to have bent over once at most
to breathe life into the child that lay dead; nevertheless he bent over seven times and
lay right over him, thus like a scout he foretold your comings together, by which you
breathed life into the slaying of God the Word, by putting to death Arius and his boon
companions.</p>

<p>Revered Fathers, with wisdom you sewed together the torn garment of Christ, rent
asunder by baying hounds, for you could not bear to look on his nakedness, as Sem and
Japhet of old could not on their father&#146;s, and you put the parricide to shame along
with his supporters: Arius, whose name the madness bears.</p>

<p>As true shepherds you bravely drove away the Macedioniusses, the Nestoriusses, the
Eftychisses, the Dioscorusses, Apollinariusses and Sabellioseverusses, exposed as
dangerous wolves in sheepskins, far from the Saviour&#146;s flock stripped of their
fleeces, making them thrice-wretched; therefore we call you blessed.</p>

<p>Now when Abram heard that Lot his nephew had been taken captive, he numbered his own
home-born servants three hundred and eighteen, and pursued the enemy as far as Dan. And he
fell upon them by night, he and his servants, and smote them and pursued them as far as
Chobal, which is on the left of Damascus. And he brought back all the cavalry of Sodom,
and he brought back Lot his nephew and all his goods and the women and the people. And the
king of Sodom came out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chodologomor
and the kings with him, to the valley of Sabi; this was the plain of Kings. And
Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought out bread and wine; he was Priest of the Most High.
And he blessed Abram and said: Blessed is Abram by the most high God, who created the
heaven and the earth. And blessed is the most high God, who has delivered your enemies
into your hand.</p>

<p>Moses said to the sons of Israel: See, I have delivered the land before you; go in and
inherit the land which I swore to your fathers, to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob, to
give it to them and to their seed after them. And I spoke to you at that time saying: I
alone shall not be able to bear you. The Lord your God has multiplied you, and behold, you
are to-day as the stars of heaven in multitude. May the Lord the God of our fathers
multiply you a thousand times more than you are, and bless you as he has spoken to you.
And I took from you wise and understanding and prudent men, and I set them to rule over
you, captains of thousands and hundreds and fifties and tens and recorders for your
judges. And I commanded your judges at that time, saying: Hear cases between your
brethren, and judge rightly between a man and his brother and the stranger who is with
him. You shall not have respect to persons in judging. You shall hear the small as well as
the great. You shall not shrink before any man&#146;s person; for the judgement is
God&#146;s.</p>

love them: and he chose their seed after them, you above all nations, as it is at this
day. So circumcise the hardness of your heart and stiffen your neck no longer. For the
Lord your God is God of Gods and the Lord of Lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who
shows no partiality, who takes no bribe. He executes judgement for the stranger, the
orphan and the widow; and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing. You shall fear
the Lord your God and serve him, and to him you shall hold fast, and take oaths in his
name. He is your boast, he your God, who has done for you the great and wonderful things

teaching the orthodox doctrine of the consubstantiality of the Holy Trinity, you overthrew

who were assembled from the whole world in the radiant city of Nicaea, as we reverence the
gatherings of the Orthodox; for they, their minds attuned to true religion, overthrew the

the Symbol of faith, which they precisely and devoutly laid down, they taught all to
confess clearly the Son of God as consubstantial and co-eternal, and existing before the

Jerusalem. Three hundred and sixty five Holy Fathers were assembled. They all assembled
against the Iconoclasts, and they condemned in writing every heresy, the leaders of the
heresies and then all the Iconoclasts; placing on record and decreeing that anyone who
does not venerate the holy images is a stranger to the Orthodox faith; that the honour
given to the image passes to its prototype; and that whoever worships and honours the
image, worships the person of the one depicted therein. And so when they had thus decreed

as the Psalmist said, the blows and lashes of those who think like infants become
infants&#146; arrows for those who think like the old; and by God&#146;s power many
tongues of those who speak blasphemies against the Highest become feeble; and each one
acknowledges the Father, the Son and the Spirit, one God, only cause of all things.</font></p>

<p>Having welded together all spiritual knowledge, and having examined together by the
Divine Spirit the heavenly and revered Creed, the revered Fathers, under God&#146;s
inspiration, traced it out. In it, clearly following the teachings of the Apostles, they
most distinctly teach that the Word is without beginning with his Begetter and most surely
consubstantial. Renowned they are, truly all-blessed and godly-minded.</font></p>

<p>Having received the spiritual brilliance of the Holy Spirit, and divinely inspired, the
good heralds proclaimed the supernatural oracle, brief in words, but rich in meaning; the
blest defenders of Gospel teachings and the godly traditions, whose revelation they
clearly received from on high, and, enlightened, set forth the Faith taught them by God.</font></p>

battle-line, brightly shining stars of the spiritual firmament, impregnable towers of the
mystical Sion, sweet-scented flowers of Paradise, pure golden mouths of the Word,
