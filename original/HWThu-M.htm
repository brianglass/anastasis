<p>The Midnight Office is read in the Church </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">and not, as usually on weekdays, in the

<p>After the Dismissal of the Midnight Office the Priest, having made the customary
metania to the Superior, or to his stall, enters the sanctuary and makes three bows before
the holy Table. He puts on the Epitrachelion and, standing in front of the holy Table,
intones:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.</font></p>

as usual.</p>

<p>The Reader begins:</font></p>

<p>With three metanias; then the following two psalms.</p>

<p>Psalm 19<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may
the name of the God of Jacob shield you. May he send you his help from the holy place, and
support you from Sion. May he remember your every sacrifice, and accept with favour your
whole burnt offering. May the Lord give you your heart&#146;s desire, and fulfil your
every purpose. We shall rejoice in your salvation, and be magnified in the name of our the
Lord our God. May the Lord fulfil all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved
his Christ. He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty acts is the salvation of his
right hand. Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will call on the
name of the Lord our God. They were fettered and fell, but we have risen and been set
upright. Lord, save the king, and hear us on the day we call upon you.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Psalm 20<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The king will rejoice in your power, O Lord, he
will exult exceedingly in your salvation. You gave him his heart&#146;s desire; you did
not deny him the request of his lips. For you came to meet him with blessings of goodness;
you placed a crown of precious stones upon his head. He asked you for life, and you gave
him length of days for age on age. Great is his glory because of your salvation; you will
place on him glory and majesty. For you will give him blessing for age on age, and make
him glad with the joy of your countenance. For the king puts his hope in the Lord, and
through the mercy of the Most High he will not be shaken. May your hand light upon all
your enemies, and your right hand find out all who hate you. You will make them like a
blazing oven at the time of your presence. The Lord will confound them in his wrath and
fire will devour them. You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their seed
from among the children of humankind. Because they intended evils against you, and devised
plans by which they can in no way succeed. For you will put them to flight; among your
remnants you will prepare their presence. Be exalted, Lord, in your power; we will sing
and praise your mighty acts.</p>

<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and
to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p>Psalm 3<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, why have those who afflict me been
multiplied? Many rise against me. Many say to my soul, &#145;There is no salvation for him
in his God&#146;. But you, Lord, are my helper, my glory, and the one who lifts up my
head. With my voice, I cried to the Lord, and he heard me from his holy mountain. I lay
down and slept; I awoke, because the Lord will assist me. I will not be afraid of tens of
thousands of people who surround me. Rise, Lord, save me, my God; because you have struck
all who are vainly my foes. You have smashed the teeth of sinners. Salvation is the

<p>Psalm 37<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor
chastise me in your wrath. For your arrows have been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a
heavy hand upon me. There is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in
my bones on account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my head; like a heavy burden
they weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank and festered on account of my foolishness. I
was wretched and utterly bowed down; I went about mourning all day long. For my loins were
filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated
exceedingly; I howled from the groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you,
and my groaning was not hidden from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and
even the light of my eyes had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and
stood against me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life used
force, and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and meditated trickeries all day
long. But I, like a deaf man, heard nothing; like one who is dumb, who does not open his
mouth. So I became like one who cannot hear, and in whose mouth there are no rebukes. For
in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will answer me, O Lord my God. For I said: Let my foes
never exult over me. When my foot slipped they crowed over me. For I am ready for blows
and my pain is with me continually. For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my
sin. But my enemies live and have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly have
been multiplied. Those who repay me with evils in place of good have slandered me, since I
pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not go far from me. Hasten to help
me, Lord of my salvation.</font></p>

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">O God, my God, I watch for you at dawn; my soul
has thirsted for you, my flesh how often in a desert, untrodden and waterless land. Thus I
appeared before you in the holy place, to see your power and your glory. For your mercy is
better than life; my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live, and in
your name I will lift up my hands. May my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; my
mouth will praise you with joyful lips. When I remembered you upon my bed, every dawn I
meditated upon you. For you became my helper, and in the shelter of your wings I shall
rejoice. My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld me. But those who vainly sought
my life will go down to the deepest parts of the earth, they will be delivered to the
power of the sword, they will be portions for foxes. But the king will rejoice in God, and

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day,
and by night also before you. Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to
my supplication. For my soul was filled with evils, and my life drew near to Hell. I was
reckoned among those that go down to the Pit; I became as one that has no help, free among
the dead. Like the slain that sleep in the tomb, whom you remembered no more; and they
were cut off from your power. They placed me in the lowest Pit; in darkness and in the
shadow of death. Your wrath lay heavy upon me, and you brought all your waves against me.
You put my friends far from me, and made me an abomination to them. I was handed over and
I came out; my eyes grew weak because of my beggary. I cried to you, Lord, all the day; I
stretched out my hands towards you. Will you work wonders for the dead; or will physicians
raise them up again to praise you? Will any declare your mercy in the tomb, or your truth
in the place of destruction? Will your wonders be known in the dark, or your justice in a
land that has been forgotten? But to you, Lord, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer
will come before you. Why have you rejected my soul, Lord; why do you turn away your face
from me? I am poor and in toils since my youth; exalted, I was humbled and brought to
despair. Your fierce anger overwhelmed me, and your terrors appalled me. They surrounded
me like water all day long; they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour
you have put far from me, and my companions because of my misery.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 102<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is
within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of his
benefits. He forgives all your iniquities; he heals all your diseases; he redeems your
life from corruption and crowns you with mercy and compassion; he satisfies your desire
with good things; your youth will be renewed like an eagle&#146;s. The Lord performs deeds
of mercy and judgement for all who are oppressed. He made known his ways to Moses, his
wishes to the children of Israel. The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering
and full of mercy. He will not always be wrathful, nor will he be enraged for ever. He has
not dealt with us according to our iniquities, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For,
like the height of heaven above the earth, the Lord has made his mercy prevail over those
that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he taken our sins from us.
As a father takes pity on his children the Lord has taken pity on those who fear him. For
he knows of what we are made; has remembered that we are but dust. As for man, his days
are but as grass, he will blossom like a flower of the field; for when a wind has passed
over it, it will be no more and will know its place no longer. But the mercy of the Lord
is for ever and ever upon those who fear him; and his justice upon their children&#146;s
children, upon those who keep his covenant and remember his commandments to do them. The
Lord has prepared his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Bless the Lord, all
you his Angels, powerful in strength, who perform his word, and listen to the voice of his
words. Bless the Lord, all you his Powers, his Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord,
all you his works. In every place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul!</font></p>

servant: for in your sight no one living can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul,
humbled my life to the ground. Made me dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My
spirit grew despondent within me and my heart within me was troubled. I remembered days of
old, I meditated on all your works: I made the works of your hands my meditation. I
stretched out my hands towards you: my soul thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear
me swiftly, O Lord, my spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be
like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have
hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I should walk, for to you I have lifted up
my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord: I have run to you for shelter. Teach me to do

<p>At that time the festival of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was near.
The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put Jesus to death, for they
were afraid of the people. Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was one of
the number of the twelve; he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers
of the temple police about how he might betray him to them. They were greatly pleased and
agreed to give him money. So he consented and began to look for an opportunity to betray
him to them when no crowd was present. Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the
Passover had to be sacrificed. So he sent Peter and John, saying, &#145;Go and prepare the
Passover for us that we may eat it.&#146; They asked him, &#145;Where do you want us to
make preparations?&#146; He said to them, &#145;See, when you have entered the city, a man
carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house he enters and say to the
master of the house, &#145;The teacher says to you, &#145;Where is the guest room, where I
may eat the Passover with my disciples?&#146;&#146; He will show you a large upper room,
already furnished. Make preparations for us there.&#146; So they went and found everything
as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover. When the hour came, he took his place
at the table, and the twelve apostles with him. He said to them, &#145;I have eagerly
desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for I tell you, I will not of eat
it any longer until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.&#146; Then he took the cup, and
after giving thanks he said, &#145;Take this and divide it among yourselves; for I tell
you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God
comes.&#146; Then he took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and
gave it to them, saying, &#145;This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in
remembrance of me.&#146; And he did the same with the cup after supper, saying, &#145;This
cup is the new covenant in my blood that is poured out for you. But see, the one who
betrays me is with me, and his hand is on the table. For the Son of Man is going as it has
been determined, but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed!&#146; Then they began to ask
one another, which one of them it could be who would do this. A dispute also arose among
them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest. But he said to them,
&#145;The kings of the nations lord it over them; and those in authority over them are
called benefactors. But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like
the youngest, and the leader like one who serves. For who is greater, the one who is at
the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one
who serves. You are those who have stood by me in my trials; and I confer on you, just as
my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom, so that you may eat and drink at my table in my
kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. Simon, Simon,
see! Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your
own faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your
brothers.&#146; And he said to him, &#145;Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to
death!&#146; Jesus said, &#145;I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow today, until you
have denied three times that you know me.&#146; He said to them, &#145;When I sent you out
without a purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?&#146; They said,
&#145;Nothing.&#146; He said to them, &#145;But now, the one who has a purse must take it,
and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one. For I
tell you, this scripture must be fulfilled in me, &#145;And he was counted among the
lawless&#146;; and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled.&#146; They said,
&#145;Lord, look, here are two swords.&#146; He replied, &#145;It is enough.&#146; He came
out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him.</font></p>

evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words and win when you are judged.
For see, in wickedness I was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have
loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will
sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will wash me and I shall be made
whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been
humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out
from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your
salvation, and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your
ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from
bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips, and my
mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it.
You will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a
broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good
pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a
sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer
calves upon your altar.</font></p>

<p>The blessed banqueters in Sion, remaining faithful to the Word, the Apostles followed
the Shepherd like sheep, and united to Christ, from whom they were not parted, being
nourished with the divine Word, with thanksgiving they cried: You his works praise the
Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.</p>

<p>The hateful Iscariot intentionally forgetting the law of friendship, made ready for
betrayal the feet that he had washed. And having eaten your bread, your divine Body, he
lifted up his heel against you, O Christ, and knew not how to cry: You his works praise
the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.</p>

<p>The one without conscience received the Body, release from sin, and the divine Blood,
poured out on behalf of the world. He did not flinch from drinking what he had sold for a
