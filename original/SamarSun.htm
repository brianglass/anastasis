<p>Finding the woman of Samaria by the well of Jacob, Jesus, who covers the earth with
clouds, asked water of her. O the wonder! He who rides on the Cherubim converses with a
woman who is a harlot. He asks for water, who hung the earth upon the waters. He seeks
water, who pours out springs and pools of water, as he wishes truly to draw her who is
hunted by the warlike foe, and to quench with the water of life the thirst of her who is
aflame with foul desires, as he alone is compassionate and loves mankind.</p>

you gave birth ineffably in the flesh to our God, and through your bearing child you freed

<p>The mid-point of the days is here, which begin with the saving Resurrection and are

unites the two, and it is honoured for it reveals in advance the coming glory of the
Master&#146;s Assumption.</p>

<p>Sion heard and was glad, when the good tidings of the Resurrection were proclaimed. Her
faithful offspring rejoiced when they saw him also washing away by the Spirit the stain of
the murder of Christ. Keeping festival she makes ready the joyful mid-point of the two.</p>

<p>The abundant outpouring of the divine Spirit upon all draws near, as it is written; the
herald is the day that forms the half-way mark of the certain promise which was given by
Christ to his Disciples after his death and burial and Resurrection, and shows the

Samaria then came near to draw water. When the Saviour saw her he said: Give me water to

Seeing her, the Saviour said: Give me water to drink, and go, call your husband. But she,
as though talking with a man and not with God, keen to deceive, said: I have no husband.
The Teacher answered her: You say truly: I have no husband, for you have had five, and the
one you have now is not your husband. But she, smitten by the word, ran to the city and
cried out to the crowds, saying: Come, see Christ, who grants the world his great mercy.</p>

mother, source of life, so that he, who has great and rich mercy, might refashion his own
