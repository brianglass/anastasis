<p>The Midnight Office is read in the Church </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">and not, as usually on weekdays, in the

<p>After the Dismissal of the Midnight Office the Priest, having made the customary
metania to the Superior, or to his stall, enters the sanctuary and makes three bows before
the holy Table. He puts on the Epitrachelion and, standing in front of the holy Table,
intones:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.</font></p>

<p>The Priest blesses the incense and begins to cense the sanctuary and the whole church
as usual.</p>

<p>The Reader begins:</font></p>

<p>Psalm 19<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may
the name of the God of Jacob shield you. May he send you his help from the holy place, and
support you from Sion. May he remember your every sacrifice, and accept with favour your
whole burnt offering. May the Lord give you your heart&#146;s desire, and fulfil your
every purpose. We shall rejoice in your salvation, and be magnified in the name of our the
Lord our God. May the Lord fulfil all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved
his Christ. He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty acts is the salvation of his
right hand. Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will call on the
name of the Lord our God. They were fettered and fell, but we have risen and been set
upright. Lord, save the king, and hear us on the day we call upon you.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Psalm 20<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The king will rejoice in your power, O Lord, he
will exult exceedingly in your salvation. You gave him his heart&#146;s desire; you did
not deny him the request of his lips. For you came to meet him with blessings of goodness;
you placed a crown of precious stones upon his head. He asked you for life, and you gave
him length of days for age on age. Great is his glory because of your salvation; you will
place on him glory and majesty. For you will give him blessing for age on age, and make
him glad with the joy of your countenance. For the king puts his hope in the Lord, and
through the mercy of the Most High he will not be shaken. May your hand light upon all
your enemies, and your right hand find out all who hate you. You will make them like a
blazing oven at the time of your presence. The Lord will confound them in his wrath and
fire will devour them. You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their seed
from among the children of humankind. Because they intended evils against you, and devised
plans by which they can in no way succeed. For you will put them to flight; among your
remnants you will prepare their presence. Be exalted, Lord, in your power; we will sing
and praise your mighty acts.</p>

<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and
to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p>Psalm 3<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, why have those who afflict me been
multiplied? Many rise against me. Many say to my soul, &#145;There is no salvation for him
in his God&#146;. But you, Lord, are my helper, my glory, and the one who lifts up my
head. With my voice, I cried to the Lord, and he heard me from his holy mountain. I lay
down and slept; I awoke, because the Lord will assist me. I will not be afraid of tens of
thousands of people who surround me. Rise, Lord, save me, my God; because you have struck
all who are vainly my foes. You have smashed the teeth of sinners. Salvation is the

<p>Psalm 37<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor
chastise me in your wrath. For your arrows have been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a
heavy hand upon me. There is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in
my bones on account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my head; like a heavy burden
they weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank and festered on account of my foolishness. I
was wretched and utterly bowed down; I went about mourning all day long. For my loins were
filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated
exceedingly; I howled from the groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you,
and my groaning was not hidden from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and
even the light of my eyes had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and
stood against me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life used
force, and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and meditated trickeries all day
long. But I, like a deaf man, heard nothing; like one who is dumb, who does not open his
mouth. So I became like one who cannot hear, and in whose mouth there are no rebukes. For
in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will answer me, O Lord my God. For I said: Let my foes
never exult over me. When my foot slipped they crowed over me. For I am ready for blows
and my pain is with me continually. For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my
sin. But my enemies live and have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly have
been multiplied. Those who repay me with evils in place of good have slandered me, since I
pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not go far from me. Hasten to help
me, Lord of my salvation.</font></p>

has thirsted for you, my flesh how often in a desert, untrodden and waterless land. Thus I
appeared before you in the holy place, to see your power and your glory. For your mercy is
better than life; my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live, and in
your name I will lift up my hands. May my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; my
mouth will praise you with joyful lips. When I remembered you upon my bed, every dawn I
meditated upon you. For you became my helper, and in the shelter of your wings I shall
rejoice. My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld me. But those who vainly sought
my life will go down to the deepest parts of the earth, they will be delivered to the
power of the sword, they will be portions for foxes. But the king will rejoice in God, and
all who swear by him will be praised; for the mouths of those who speak iniquities have

Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day, and by night also before you. Let my
prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to my supplication. For my soul was
filled with evils, and my life drew near to Hell. I was reckoned among those that go down
to the Pit; I became as one that has no help, free among the dead. Like the slain that
sleep in the tomb, whom you remembered no more; and they were cut off from your power.
They placed me in the lowest Pit; in darkness and in the shadow of death. Your wrath lay
heavy upon me, and you brought all your waves against me. You put my friends far from me,
and made me an abomination to them. I was handed over and I came out; my eyes grew weak
because of my beggary. I cried to you, Lord, all the day; I stretched out my hands towards
you. Will you work wonders for the dead; or will physicians raise them up again to praise
you? Will any declare your mercy in the tomb, or your truth in the place of destruction?
Will your wonders be known in the dark, or your justice in a land that has been forgotten?
But to you, Lord, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer will come before you. Why
have you rejected my soul, Lord; why do you turn away your face from me? I am poor and in
toils since my youth; exalted, I was humbled and brought to despair. Your fierce anger
overwhelmed me, and your terrors appalled me. They surrounded me like water all day long;
they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour you have put far from me, and
my companions because of my misery.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 102</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord,
O my soul, and forget none of his benefits. He forgives all your iniquities; he heals all
your diseases; he redeems your life from corruption and crowns you with mercy and
compassion; he satisfies your desire with good things; your youth will be renewed like an
eagle&#146;s. The Lord performs deeds of mercy and judgement for all who are oppressed. He
made known his ways to Moses, his wishes to the children of Israel. The Lord is
compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy. He will not always be
wrathful, nor will he be enraged for ever. He has not dealt with us according to our
iniquities, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For, like the height of heaven above
the earth, the Lord has made his mercy prevail over those that fear him. As far as the
east is from the west, so far has he taken our sins from us. As a father takes pity on his
children the Lord has taken pity on those who fear him. For he knows of what we are made;
has remembered that we are but dust. As for man, his days are but as grass, he will
blossom like a flower of the field; for when a wind has passed over it, it will be no more
and will know its place no longer. But the mercy of the Lord is for ever and ever upon
those who fear him; and his justice upon their children&#146;s children, upon those who
keep his covenant and remember his commandments to do them. The Lord has prepared his
throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Bless the Lord, all you his Angels,
powerful in strength, who perform his word, and listen to the voice of his words. Bless
the Lord, all you his Powers, his Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord, all you his
works. In every place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul!</font></p>

Lord, hear my prayer: in your truth give ear to my supplication, and in your justice hear
me. Do not enter into judgement with your servant: for in your sight no one living can be
justified. For the enemy pursued my soul, humbled my life to the ground. Made me dwell in
darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit grew despondent within me and my heart
within me was troubled. I remembered days of old, I meditated on all your works: I made
the works of your hands my meditation. I stretched out my hands towards you: my soul
thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord, my spirit has failed. Do
not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear
of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I
should walk, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord: I have
run to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit
will guide me in an upright land. For your name&#146;s sake, O Lord, you will give me
life. In your justice, you will bring my soul out of trouble, in your mercy slay my

<p>At that time, the Pharisees took counsel against Jesus and plotted to entrap him in
what he said. So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying,
&#145;Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, and show
deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality. Tell us, then, what you
think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?&#146; But Jesus, aware of their
malice, said, &#145;Why are you putting me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin
used for the tax.&#146; And they brought him a denarius. Then he said to them, &#145;Whose
image is this, and whose title?&#146; They answered, &#145;Caesar&#146;s.&#146; Then he
said to them, &#145;Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar&#146;s, and to God
the things that are God&#146;s.&#146; When they heard this, they were amazed; and they
left him and went away. The same day some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection,
came to him; and they asked him a question, saying, &#145;Teacher, Moses said, &#145;If a
man dies childless, his brother shall marry the widow, and raise up children for his
brother.&#146; Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married, and died
childless, leaving the widow to his brother. The second did the same, so also the third,
down to the seventh. Last of all, the woman herself died. In the resurrection, then, whose
wife of the seven will she be? For all of them had married her.&#146; Jesus answered them,
&#145;You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God. For in
the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in
heaven. And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by
God, &#145;I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob&#146;? God is
not God of the dead, but of the living.&#146; And when the crowd heard it, they were
astounded at his teaching. When the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees,
they gathered together, and one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him.
&#145;Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?&#146; He said to him,
&#145;&#145;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul,
and with all your mind.&#146; This is the first and greatest commandment. And a second is
like it: &#145;You shall love your neighbour as yourself.&#146; On these two commandments
hang all the law and the prophets.&#146; Now while the Pharisees were gathered together,
Jesus asked them this question, &#145;What do you think of Christ? Whose son is he?&#146;
They said to him, &#145;David&#146;s.&#146; He said to them, &#145;How is it then that
David by the Spirit calls him Lord, saying, &#145;The Lord said to my Lord, &#145;Sit at
my right hand, until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet&#146; &#145;? If
David then calls him Lord, how can he be his son?&#146; No one was able to give him an
answer, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions. Then Jesus said
to the crowds and to his disciples, &#145;The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses&#146;
seat; therefore, whatever they teach you to observe, observe and do it; but do not do as
they do, for they speak and do not do it. They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay
them on the shoulders of others; but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to
move them. They do all their works to be seen by others; for they make their phylacteries
broad and their fringes long. They love to have the place of honour at banquets and the
best seats in the synagogues, and to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, and to
have people call them rabbi. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher,
Christ, and you are all brothers. And call no one your father on earth, for you have one
Father &#151; the one in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one
instructor, Christ. The greatest among you will be your servant. All who exalt themselves
will be humbled, and all who humble themselves will be exalted. But woe to you, scribes
and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the houses of widows and, as a pretext, recite
long prayers. Because of this you will receive a more severe condemnation. Woe to you,
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. For
you do not go in yourselves, and when others are going in, you stop them. Woe to you,
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cross sea and land to make a single convert,
and you make the new convert twice as much a child of hell as yourselves. Woe to you,
blind guides, who say, &#145;Whoever swears by the temple is bound by nothing, but whoever
swears by the gold of the sanctuary is bound by the oath.&#146; Blind fools! For which is
greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold? &#145;Whoever swears by the
altar is bound by nothing, but whoever swears by the gift that is on the altar is bound by
the oath.&#146; Blind fools! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies
the gift? So whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it; and
whoever swears by the temple, swears by it and by the one who dwells in it; and whoever
swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by the one who is seated upon it. Woe to
you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint, dill, and cumin, and have
neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. It is these you
ought to have practised without neglecting the others. Blind guides! You strain out a gnat
but swallow a camel! Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the
outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of greed and injustice. You
blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup, so that the outside also may become
clean. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs,
which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of the bones of the dead
and of all kinds of filth. So you also on the outside appear righteous to others, but
inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the graves of the righteous,
and you say, &#145;If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken
part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.&#146; Thus you testify against
yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the
measure of your ancestors. You snakes, you brood of vipers! How can you escape being
sentenced to hell? Therefore I send you prophets, sages, and scribes, some of whom you
will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to
town, so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of
righteous Abel to the blood of Zachary son of Barachias, whom you murdered between the
temple and the altar. Amen, I say to you, all this will come upon this generation.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How
often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her
wings, and you were not willing! See, your house is left to you, desolate. For I tell you,
you will not see me again until you say, &#145;Blessed is he who comes in the name of the
Lord.&#146; &#145;</font></p>

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with your
great mercy. According to the multitude of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me
thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my
wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you alone I have sinned and done what is
evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words and win when you are judged.
For see, in wickedness I was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have
loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will
sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will wash me and I shall be made
whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been
humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out
from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your
salvation, and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your
ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from
bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips, and my
mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it.
You will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a
broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good
pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a
sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer
calves upon your altar.</font></p>
