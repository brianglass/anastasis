<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5" color="#FF0000">INTRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">There is some confusion over the numbering of this
instruction. The list in Migne gives it as number 5 and assigns it to the Wednesday of
Mid-Pentecost, but in the text it is given as number 6 and described as <i>Ante
Mesopentecosten. </i>In the text the feast is said to be &#145;at the doors&#146;, which
would suggest that the sermon was given before the day itself.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">This Instruction contains a number of words that are
not attested in the standard lexica, but their meaning is clear, except for the second
verb in the allusion to Acts 1,3-4, where the commentators are divided between &#145;meet
with&#146;, &#145;gather&#146; and &#145;eat&#146;. Most English versions of the New
Testament give the former, but St John Chrysostom and St Jerome, who has
&#145;conuescens&#146;, prefer the second.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5" color="#FF0000"><b>CATECHESIS 6</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><i>That one must give off a sweet
fragrance through acquiring the virtues.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Brethren and fathers, at Christ&#146;s resurrection
creation too, putting away its winter gloom, like a deadness puts out fresh shoots and as
it were comes to life again. And yes, we see the earth wearing green, the plants
flourishing, the animals skipping around [</font><font color="#008080" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">an unattested word</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">], the sea
tamed and everything being changed for the better.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">But I must explain why I have said this. If
inanimate and irrational creatures are made radiant and lovely by the resplendent
resurrection, how much more ought we, who have been honoured with reason and the image of
God, make ourselves bright by our life and give off sweet fragrance by the spirit. For one
who strives after virtue is truly the sweet fragrance of Christ, and the Apostle bears
witness to this when he says, <i>For we are the sweet fragrance of Christ for God among
those who are being saved and those who are perishing, for the latter a scent of death
leading to death, for the former an scent of life leading to life </i>[</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">2 Cor. 2,15-16</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">].</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">And it is possible to say this as well. Before his
transgression, Adam too was a sweet fragrance for God, made bright by immortality and
incorruption and engrossed in heavenly contemplation. And therefore, like a fragrant
meadow filled with flowers, appropriately he dwelt in Paradise, giving off the virtues.
The patriarch Isaac also, when he smelt a sweet aroma on his son Jacob, said, <i>See, the
scent of my son is like the scent of a fertile field that the Lord has blessed</i> [</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Gen. 27,27</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">], that is to say the scent that has been received spiritually.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">So then, my brothers, let us give off a sweet
spiritual fragrance, a perfume that each one produces [</font><font color="#008080" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">unattested</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">] for
themselves by a blending of the virtues, as a truly master perfumer. This perfume is
blessed. This perfume is sweet to God. This perfume attracts angels, but repels demons.
With this perfume women ran behind Jesus, as it says in the Song of Songs [</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">1,4 LXX</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">]. With this perfume too let us also run as we celebrate with
sincerity the holy Mid-Pentecost, which is at the doors, since it is written, <i>When it
was already the mid-point of the feast, Jesus went up to the Temple and taught, and the
Jews marvelled, saying, &#145;How does this man know letters, without having learnt?&#146;
</i>[</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">John 7,14-15</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">] But this was before the Passion, while now, after the
Resurrection, he appears to and eats [</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Cf. Acts 1,3-4</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">] with the
holy Apostles, initiating them into greater and more ineffable mysteries, and &#151; O
what inexpressible condescension! &#151; after the Resurrection he touched food, though
his holy flesh had no need to. But nevertheless, so as to confirm his Resurrection, he ate
and drank and let his side be handled. And to those who thought that he was a spirit he
said, <i>See my hands and feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, because a spirit
does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have </i>[</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Luke 24,39</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">]. What
do you say to that, enemy of Christ? If he has flesh and bones, does he not have the
possibility of being portrayed in an image? So if the latter is impossible, so was the
former. But he himself silently bears witness also to his being portrayed, for each of
them confirms the other.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">But the iconoclasts, who think like the Manicheans, <i>will
pay the penalty of everlasting destruction </i>[</font><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">2 Thess. 1,9</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">], as it is
written. Let us though, brethren, who believe with orthodox understanding that we both see
and worship our Lord Jesus Christ in an image, display a way of life worthy of the faith,
pure, blameless, guiltless, so as not to limp on either account, but well-pleasing on both
we may attain the kingdom of heaven, in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory and might
with the Father and the holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font></p>
