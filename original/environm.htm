<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5">Office of supplication to our God
and Saviour Jesus Christ, who loves humankind, for our environment and for the welfare of
the whole creation.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Book Antiqua" size="5"><img src="City031.gif" border="5" WIDTH="384" HEIGHT="288"></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Book Antiqua">INTRODUCTION</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The late Patriarch
Demetrios I of blessed memory made 1 September a day of special prayer and supplication
for the Environment and commissioned the late Monk Gerasimos of the Skete of Little Saint
Anne on the Holy Mountain of Athos to compose a special office for it. It is this office
that is translated here.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">For more than half a
century Father Gerasimos, as 'Hymnwriter of the Great Church', wrote an imposing number of
offices and other hymns for the Church, which makes him one of the most prolific
hymnographers in the history of Orthodoxy.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The following
translation was originally made at the request of the European Council of Churches in
1992. I have ventured to make two additions to his office. Fr Gerasimos did not provide
any verses for the Synaxarion and I have filled this lacuna with the traditional couplet,
in both Greek and English. He allowed for two readings from the Gospel at the Liturgy, but
only one for the Apostle. Since this is liturgically anomalous, I have tentatively
suggested as a second Apostle the reading from the Epistle of James, set for Thursday of
Week 32.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">In my original
translation I added some five dozen footnotes giving references to the many quotations and
allusions to Holy Scripture in which the text abounds. I have not added them here, so as
not to clutter the text, but I may do so when I move the office to the Geniza. The
translations from Holy Scripture are my own. In the Old Testament readings there are a
number of differences from the Hebrew and even, in the reading from Isaias taken from the
Menaion for 1 September, from the standard text of the Septuagint. I have not attempted to
reproduce the acrostic of Canon.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The present Patriarch
of Constantinople, His All-Holiness Bartolomew I, has maintained and developed the
interest and concern of the Patriarchate for the problems of the environment and this
office is now used by a number of Orthodox Churches, either on the 1 September itself or
on the first Sunday of September.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Christ Saviour, Lover of mankind, who brought all

accomplish unerringly the goal which you laid down in the beginning, as you are powerful,
bless the whole creation which you fashioned.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Give peace to all the nations, Lord, and
understanding in all things, so that we may lead a tranquil life and always keep your
laws, which you laid down for the whole creation for the unalterable maintenance and

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Lover of mankind, keep unharmed the environment that
clothes the earth, through which, by your will, we who inhabit the earth live and move and
have our being, so that we, your unworthy suppliants, may be delivered from destruction
and ruin.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Fence round the whole creation, Christ Saviour, with
the mighty strength of your love for mankind, and deliver the earth we inhabit from the
corruption which threatens it; for we, your servants, have set our hopes on you.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Put an end, O Saviour, to the evil designs which are
being devised against us with senseless intent, and turn aside from the earth every
destructive action of the works of human hands which contrive corruption leading to
perdition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Lord, who wrap creation in clouds, as godly David
sang, watch over the environment of the earth, which you created from the beginning for
the preservation of mortals, and give us the breath of the winds and the flow of waters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Almighty Lord, who created all things with wisdom
and who watch over and guide them by your all-powerful hand, grant well-being so that the
whole creation may prosper and remain unharmed by hostile elements; for you, Master,
commanded that the works of your hands should remain unshaken until the end of the age;
for you spoke and they came into being and from you they receive mercy for the turning
away of all evil, and for the salvation of the human race that glorifies your name which
is praised above all.</font></p>

will not sing the praise of your child-birth without labour? For the only-begotten Son,
who shone out from the Father beyond time, came forth from you, pure Maiden, ineffably
incarnate. By nature he is God, by nature he became man for our sakes, not divided in a
duality of persons, but known without confusion in a duality of natures. O honoured and
all-blessed, implore him to have mercy on our souls.</font></p>

ordinances and keep my commandments and do them, I will give you rain in its season and
the earth will give its produce and the trees of the plains their fruit. Your threshing
time will overtake the vintage, and the vintage will overtake the sowing. You will eat
your bread to the full and dwell in safety on your land; and no one shall make you afraid.
And I will destroy the evil wild beasts from your lands, and war shall not pass through
your land, and enemies will fall before you. Five of you will pursue a hundred and a
hundred of you will pursue tens of thousands. And I will look upon you and bless you and
make you increase and multiply and I will establish my covenant with you. And you will eat
what is old and very old, and bring out the old to make way for the new. And my soul will
not abhor you, and I will walk among you, and I will be your God and you shall be my
people. But if you will not listen to me, nor observe these ordinances of mine, but
disobey them, and if your soul loathes my judgements, so that you do not keep all my
commandments, I in turn will treat you like this: I will bring distress upon you, and you
will sow your seed in vain and your enemies will devour your labours. And I will set my
face against you and you will fall before your foes and they will pursue you and you will
flee though no one pursues you; and I will smash the arrogance of your pride. And I will
make the heaven like iron for you and your earth like solid bronze. And your strength will
be in vain and your land will not give its fruit, and the trees of the field will not give
their fruit. And I will send the wild beasts of the earth against you, and they will
consume your cattle, and the sword will come against you and make you few in number. And
your land will be desert and your farms will be desert; because you have walked against me
crookedly, and I will walk against you with crooked rage, says the Lord God, the Holy One
of Israel&#146;.</font></p>

is the abundance of your mercy and of your acts of pity, that you have withheld yourself
from us? For you are our Father, because Abraham has not known us, nor Israel acknowledged
us. But do you, Lord, our Father, deliver us; from the beginning your name is upon us. Why
have you made us wander from your way, Lord? Why have you hardened our hearts not to fear
you? Return for the sake of your servants, for the sake of the tribes that are your
heritage, that in a little while we may inherit your holy mountain. Our enemies have
trampled down your sanctuary, we have become as at the beginning when you did not rule
over us, nor had your name been invoked upon us. If you open the heaven, trembling from
you will seize the mountains and they will melt as wax melts before the fire, and fire
will burn up your adversaries, and your name will be manifest among your adversaries;
nations will be troubled at your presence. When you do glorious deeds, trembling from you
will seize the mountains. From eternity we have not heard, nor have our eyes seen any God
but you. And your works are true, and you will perform mercy for those who wait for you.
For mercy will meet with those who do right and remember your ways. And now, Lord, you are
our Father, while we are clay and you are our Fashioner. We are all the work of your
hands. Do not be exceedingly angry with us, Lord, and do not remember our sins for ever.
And now, look upon us, Lord, because we are all your people.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Book Antiqua" size="5">T</font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">hus says the Lord: &#145;I have remembered the mercy of your youth and the love
of your marriage, of your following the Holy One of Israel, says the Lord, the Holy One of
Israel. The beginning of his produce was for the Lord. All those who devoured him will
offend and evils will come upon them, says the Lord. Hear the word of the Lord, house of
Jacob, and every family of the house of Israel. Thus says the Lord, What offence did your
fathers find in me, that they revolted far from me and went after vanities and became
vain? And they did not say, &#145;Where is the Lord who brought us up out of the land of
Egypt, who guided us in the wilderness, in a boundless and trackless land, in a land
without water or fruit, and in the shadow of death, in a land through which no man had
passed, nor had any son of man dwelt there?&#145; And I led you to Carmel to eat its
fruits and its good things; and you went in and you defiled my land and made my
inheritance an abomination. The priests did not say &#145;Where is the Lord?&#145; And
those who cling to the law did not know me, and the shepherds acted impiously towards me,
and the prophets prophesied by Baal and went after that which does not profit. Therefore I
will be brought to trial before you again, says the Lord, and I will be brought to trial
before your children&#146;s children. Cross to the islands of the Kittim and look, and to
Kedar and send and observe carefully; and see if such things have been done; if the
nations will change their gods, though they are no gods. But my people have changed their
glory for something from which they will gain nothing. Heaven was amazed at this and
trembled exceedingly, says the Lord.</font></p>

positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity.
This is right and is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who desires all to be
saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God; there is also one
mediator between God and humanity, a human being, Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a
ransom for all; this was attested at the right time. For this I was appointed a herald and
an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles
in faith and truth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">[Brethren, submit therefore to God. Resist the devil
and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your
hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Be wretched and mourn and
weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to dejection. Humble yourselves
before the Lord and he will exalt you. Do not speak evil against one another, brethren.
One that speaks evil against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law
and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
There is one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you
that you judge your neighbour? Come now, you who say, &#145;Today or tomorrow we will go
into such and such a town and spend a year there and do business and make a profit&#146;;
whereas you do not know about tomorrow. What is your life? For you are a mist that will
appear for a little time and then it will vanish. Instead you ought to say, &#145;If the
Lord wishes, we will both live and do this or that&#146;. As it is, you boast in your
arrogance. All such boasting is evil. Anyone who knows what it is right to do and fails to
do it, for them it is sin. Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are
coming upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and
silver have rusted, and their rust will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh.
Like fire you have stored up treasure in the last days. Behold, the wages of the labourers
who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the
harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts. You have lived on the earth in
luxury and in pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. You have
condemned, you have killed the righteous one; he does not resist you. Be patient,
therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the
precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it until it receives the early and the
late rain. You also be patient. Strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is
near. Do not grumble, brethren, against one another, that you may not be judged. See, the
Judge is standing at the doors.] </font></p>

synagogue on the Sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of
the prophet Isaias was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it
was written: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good
news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight
to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord&#146;s
favour. And he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes
of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. Then he began to say to them: Today this
scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing. All spoke well of him and were amazed at the
gracious words that came from his mouth.</font></p>

that suffering, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the

will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. Then he will send out
the angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the
ends of heaven. From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender
and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. So also, when you see these
