<p ALIGN="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5">INTRODUCTION</font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5"><small>The authorship of the Akathist
Hymn to the Mother of God is the subject of much learned discussion, though many reputable
scholars attribute it to St Romanos the Melodist, and so I have put this tentative
translation on his page. The poem defies every translator and it is virtually impossible
all the rhetorical devices which are such a striking feature of the Greek original. The
original has an alphabetical acrostic for the first word of each Kontakion and Ikos and
the lines begining </small></font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">&#145;Hail!&#146; are
marked by many internal rhymes. These are indicated in the translation by em rules.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">I have translated the Greek
&#145;Chaire!&#145; by &#145;Hail!&#146; as this is the most natural meaning of the Greek.
Even though etymologically it means &#145;Rejoice!&#146;, it is a standard greeting, like
the Latin &#145;Ave!&#145;, which is what the Roman soldiers presumably said to the Lord
as they mocked him. In the New Testament it often translates the Hebrew
&#145;Shalom!&#146;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Liturgically the Hymn forms part of
Matins on the Saturday of the Akathist, and in the monasteries of the the Holy Mountain it
is read each night at Compline. In Greek use it is chanted solemnly in four sections at
Compline on the first four Fridays of Lent, the whole being chanted at Compline on the
fifth, the eve of Akathist Saturday.</font></p>
