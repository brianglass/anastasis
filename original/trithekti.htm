<p>Psalm 16</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
Hearken to my justice, O Lord; attend to my supplication. Give ear to my prayer
from lips which do not deceive. Let my judgement come from your presence, let my
eyes see fair dealings. You have tested my heart, you have visited me by night;
you have tried me by fire and no injustice has been found in me. That my mouth
might not speak of human deeds, for the sake of the words of your lips, I have
kept hard ways. Direct my steps in your paths, that my steps may not slip. I
have called, for you heard me, O God; incline your ear to me, and hearken to my
words. Show the wonder of your mercies, you who save those that hope in you.
Guard me, Lord, like the pupil of the eye, from those who resist your right
hand. You will shelter me in the shelter of your wings, from the presence of the
impious who afflicted me. My foes have surrounded my soul; they have shut their
hearts, their mouth has spoken proudly. They cast me out and now they have
encircled me, they have fixed their eyes to bow to the ground. They came on me
like a lion ready for prey, and like a lion cub lurking in hidden places. Arise,
Lord, forestall them and cast them down; deliver my soul from the impious, your
sword from the foes of your hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of the land
in their life, and their belly was filled from your hidden things. They have
been sated with swine’s flesh and left the remainder to their infants. But I
in justice will appear in your presence; I shall be satisfied when your glory
has appeared to me.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 24</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
To you, O Lord, I have lifted my soul. My God, I have trusted in you, do not let
me be shamed for ever. Do not let my foes laugh at me; for all who wait
patiently for you shall not be shamed; let those who transgress without cause be
shamed. O Lord, make your ways known to me, and teach me your paths. Guide me
into your truth and teach me, for you are God my Saviour, and I have waited
patiently on you all the day. Remember your acts of pity, Lord, and your
mercies, for they are eternal. Do not remember the sins of my youth and
ignorance; in accordance with your mercy remember me, on account of your
goodness, O Lord. The Lord is good and upright, therefore he will give laws to
those who sin on their way. He will guide the meek with judgement, he will teach
the meek his ways. All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, for those who
seek his covenant and his testimonies. For your name’s sake, O Lord, pardon my
sin, for it is great. Who is one who fears the Lord? He will give him laws in
the way which he has chosen. His soul will dwell among good things and his seed
will inherit the earth. The Lord is the strength of those who fear him, and his
covenant will show them this. My eyes are ever towards the Lord, for he will
draw my feet out of the snare. Look on me and have mercy on me; for I am alone
and poor. The afflictions of my heart have been multiplied; bring me out of my
troubles. See my humiliation and my toil, and forgive all my sins. See my foes,
for they have been multiplied, and have hated me with an unjust hatred. Guard my
soul and deliver me; let me not be shamed, for I have hoped in you. The innocent
and upright have joined themselves to me, because I have waited patiently for
you, O Lord. O God, deliver Israel from all his afflictions.</p>

<p>Psalm 50</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with your great mercy. According to the
multitude of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me thoroughly from my
wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my wickedness, and my
sin is ever before me. Against you alone I have sinned and done what is evil in
your sight, that you may be justified in your words and win when you are judged.
For see, in wickedness I was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see,
you have loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your
wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will wash
me and I shall be made whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and
gladness; the bones which have been humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face
from my sins and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God,
and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out from your presence, and
do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your salvation,
and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your
ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation,
deliver me from bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you
will open my lips, and my mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted
a sacrifice, I would have given it. You will not take pleasure in burnt
offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit. A broken and a humbled heart
God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good pleasure, and let the
walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a sacrifice of
justice, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer calves upon
your altar.</p>

<p>Psalm 53</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
O God, save my by your name, and you will judge me by your power. O God, hear my
prayer, give ear to the words of my mouth. For strangers have risen up against
me, and mighty ones have sought my soul, and have not put God before them. For
see, God will help me, and the Lord is the protector of my soul. He will turn
evils upon my foes, in your truth wipe them out. Willingly I shall sacrifice to
you, I shall give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good. For you have
delivered me from every tribulation, and my eye has looked down on my foes.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 54</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
Give ear to my prayer, O God, and do not despise my supplication; attend to me,
and hear me. I was grieved in my meditation, and troubled by the voice of the
foe and the tribulation of the sinner. Because they cast iniquity upon me, and
in anger they were indignant with me. My heart was troubled within me, and fear
of death fell on me. Fear and trembling came upon me, and darkness covered me.
And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove’s, and I shall fly away and
find rest. See, I have gone far away in my flight, and have encamped in the
wilderness. I waited for God who saves me from faint-heartedness and from storm.
O Lord, drown and divide their tongues; because I have seen iniquity and
wrangling in the city. Day and night it will go round upon its walls, and
lawlessness and toil are in its midst, and injustice. Usury and fraud have not
left its streets. For if an enemy had reviled me, I would have endured it. And
if one who hated me had boasted against me, I would have hidden from him. But it
was you, a man my equal, my guide and my friend. Who made sweet the food we ate
together; we walked in harmony in the God’s house. Let death come upon them,
and let them go down alive into hell. For evil is in their dwellings and in
their midst. But I cried to God and the Lord heard me. At evening and morning
and at midday I shall speak and declare, and he will listen to my voice. He will
redeem my soul in peace from those who draw near me, for in crowds they were
about me. God will hear and he who is before the ages will humble them. For
there is no change with them, because they have not feared God; he has stretched
out his hand to repay. They have defiled his covenant; they have been divided by
the wrath from his presence, and their have drawn near. Their words were
smoother than oil, yet they are javelins. Cast your care on the Lord, and he
will support you; he will not let the just waver for ever. But you, O God, will
bring them down to the pit of destruction. Men of bloodshed and deceit will not
live out half their days; but I, Lord, shall hope in you.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 90</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
One who dwells in the help of the Most High will live under the protection of
the of the God of heaven, will say to the Lord, ‘You are my protector and my
refuge, my God, and I shall hope in him’. For he will deliver you from the
snare of hunters, and from the word which troubles. He will overshadow you with
his wings, and beneath his feathers you will hope; his truth will encircle you
with a shield. You will not be afraid of terror by night, of the arrow that
flies by day. Of the thing that prowls in the darkness, of mishap and the
noonday devil. A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right,
but it will not come near you. But with your eyes you will observe, and see the
reward of sinners. For you, Lord, are my hope: you have made the Most High your
refuge. Evils will not approach you, nor a scourge draw near your dwelling.
Because he has given orders to his Angels about you, to guard you in all your
ways. They will bear you on their hands, lest you dash your foot against a
stone. You will walk on asp and basilisk, and trample down lion and dragon. ‘Because
he hoped in me, I shall deliver him; I shall shelter him, because he knew my
name. He will cry to me, and I shall hear him, I am with him in trouble; I shall
rescue him and glorify him. I shall fill him with length of days, and show him

<p>As you are source of compassion, grant us pity, Mother of God. Look on a
people who have sinned and show your power as always; for hoping in you we cry,
‘Hail’, as once Gabriel did, the Chief Captain of the Bodiless Powers.</p>

<p>This Theotokion is said on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, but on Wednesday and
Friday the following is said:</p>

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>You are highly glorified, Virgin Mother of God, and we praise you, for
through your Son’s Cross Hell has been overthrown and death has died; we who
were dead have risen, and been granted life; we have obtained Paradise, the
ancient happiness; and so with thanksgiving we glorify Christ our God as mighty
and alone full of mercy.</p>

mercy (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">x40</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">).</p>
<p>At every time and at every hour, in heaven and on earth worshipped and
glorified, Christ God, long-suffering, great in mercy, great in compassion,
loving the just and merciful to sinners, calling all to salvation by the promise
of the good things to come; do you, Lord, yourself accept our entreaties at this
hour, and direct our lives to your commandments. Sanctify our souls, purify our
bodies, correct our thoughts, cleanse our ideas and deliver us from every
distress, evil, and pain. Wall us about with your holy Angels, that protected
and guided by their host we may reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge
of your unapproachable glory; for you are blessed to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<p>Lord, have mercy. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">x3</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">),
Glory. Both now. Greater in honour than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more
glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word,
truly the Mother of God we magnify you. In the name of the Lord, bless, Father.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Prayer of St Basil the Great</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>O God and Lord of powers, and Maker of all creation, who through the
compassion of your incomprehensible mercy sent down your only-begotten Son, our
Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, for the salvation of our race, and through his
precious Cross tore up the record of our sins, and by it triumphed over the
principalities and powers of darkness; do you yourself, O Master who loves
mankind, accept also our supplications of thanksgiving and entreaty; and deliver
us from destroying and dark transgression, and from all our foes, visible and
invisible, who seek to harm us. Nail down our flesh through fear of you, and do
not let our hearts incline to words or thoughts of evil, but wound our souls
with longing for you; that ever gazing upon you and guided by the light that
comes from you, seeing you the unapproachable and everlasting light, we may give
thanks to you, the Father without beginning, with your only-begotten Son and
your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of
ages. Amen.</p>

<p>According to the Typika of the Holy Mountain the Reader at once adds:</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>It is truly right to call you blessed, who gave birth to God, ever-blessed
and most pure, and Mother of our God. Greater in honour than the Cherubim and
beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave
birth to God the Word; truly the Mother of God, we magnify you.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">And Dismissal.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that after the Dismissal we leave the Church and go off to
our cells with stillness; it is not allowed to have conversations with one
another, for they have been forbidden by the holy Fathers, and we ought to
observe this after every assembly.</font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
