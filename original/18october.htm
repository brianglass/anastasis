<p ALIGN="CENTER">Verses.<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Though at Emmaus I was held from sight<br>
Of you says Luke now, Christ, I see you plain.<br>
On the eighteenth of the month, the Evangelist Luke reached his life&#146;s end.</font></p>
<font FACE="ClassGarmnd BT">

<p>Luke, the great Evangelist, was from Antioch the Great in Syria, a doctor by profession
and outstandingly skilled in the art of painting. While living and practising medicine at
Thebes in Boeotia, he encountered the holy Apostle Paul; and having come to believe in
Christ he abandoned his ancestral error. He then gave up the cure of bodies and took up
that of souls. At the suggestion of the holy Apostle Paul he composed the Gospel according
to him for one Theophilos, a Governor, who had come to believe in Christ. After Paul had
departed he taught all Greece and, so they say, when he was eighty years old he went to
his rest in peace at Thebes in Boeotia. His body was laid to rest there, God glorifying
his own servant and worker by raining down little round loaves or capsules upon his grave
as a symbol of his skill. And therefore his tomb became well known to all.</p>

<p>Constantius, the son of Constantine the Great, translated his remains from Thebes
through the grand Duke and martyr Artemios and enshrined them in the church of the Holy
Apostles under the holy table with Andrew and Timothy.</p>

<p>They say that he was the first to paint the icon of the holy Mother of God, carrying
our Lord Jesus Christ in her arms, through the painter&#146;s medium of wax, and two
others. These the great Apostle offered to the Mother of the Lord, if it pleased her. She
accepted them and said: &#145;may the grace of the One who was born from me be with them
through me&#146;. Likewise he is said to have painted the holy icons of the holy Princes
of the Apostles. And from him this fair and devout and all-honoured work was carried out
into the whole inhabited world.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Verses.<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Now from the life which runs by like a dream<br>
With ready gladness Julian runs by.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>Our father among the Saints Julian abandoned the world and went away to the banks of
the river Euphrates. There he found a cave in which he lived the solitary life. Many
enthusiasts flocked to his tiny cave and setting up huts round about to the number of a
hundred, nourished by their proximity to the teacher. This wondrous man slew a dragon and
made water gush up in waterless land. He also went to mount Sinai and built a church on
the rock on which Moses the lawgiver had seen God, as far it was possible to see him. This
church is still standing today. But when many people were fearing the return of the
impious and apostate Julian from the Persians, they asked his help, knowing him to be a
true servant of God. He prolonged his holy prayer until the tenth day and then heard the
words: &#145;Not only for your sake, but because of the night-long entreaties and
supplications of many others, the foul and impious Julian is being slain&#146;.</p>

<p>After some years, when Meletios had been driven from Antioch, a number of people
appealed to this blessed man for the sake of his many prayers and intercessions and
entreaties. He agreed and set out, and on the way he was received by a God-loving woman.
When the Saint had sat down for supper the woman&#146;s only child, who was occupied at
table, shortly disappeared from sight and as it happened fell into the well. The noble
woman, though she knew this, remained absolutely unchanged, but rather covered the well
over and bravely continued serving. She deceived the Saint when he asked where the child
was by saying he had fallen ill. When the Saint anxiously asked that the child come to the
table and enjoy a blessing, what had happened became known. He at once rose from table and
tearing the cover off the well saw the child jumping in the water safe and sound, and as
though in a game he ordered him to be brought up by means of something that was to hand.
When this had been done the child was questioned and said he had come to no harm because
he had been buoyed up and supported by the old man who had spoken with him and played with
him in the waters.</p>

<p>When he reached Antioch he dwelt in the cave in which the holy Apostle Paul had once
hidden. Once when a large crowd had flocked to the cave for the sake of the succour and
blessing of the Saint, he was in the grip of a violent fever, and was lying breathing
weakly and almost at his last breath. As they crowded round him, saying that there were
many people waiting outside and in need of blessing, he answered &#145;If health were good
for us the Lord of all things would give it&#146;; and after he had prayed he raised
himself from the raging fever for the sake of helping the crowd.</p>

<p>Once when he was on a journey and was leaving for the royal court, some one who lying
sick on coming near his cloak arose at once and followed him, as of old the lame man
followed Peter and John. Not only this, but when he had established him in the orthodox
faith he returned to his monastic training ground, making his way through Kyros. The
people of Kyros detained the Saint for his succour, saying: &#145;Servant of God, in place
of our bishop we are expecting a certain Asterios, an impious and destructive man. Stay
with us and help us if you are able, lest with his gossiping tongue he perverts us with
his words. He stayed and when he had completed an all-night prayer, with a few who had
gathered, he slew him with wrath sent by God, allowing him a life of pain of only one day.
Then he returned to his disciples and having passed a good number of years with them he
departed to the Lord.</font></p>

manifestations of the truth.</p>

<p>Having shone on the world like a sun, you stand inspired, all-praised Luke, before the
Trinity with Paul who saw God. With him, O revealer of God, we unceasingly magnify you.</p>

<p>With your light-bearing radiance, Luke, entreat that those who sing your praise may be
made bright, and bestow peace on the world, all-blessed Apostle who speak of God, that we
may unceasingly magnify you.</p>

<p>Rejoicing you now stand, Luke, before the universal King, adorned with a crown of
divine majesty and beauty, therefore, O inspired of God, we unceasingly magnify you.</font></p>

<p>Luke, Apostle of Christ, initiate of ineffable mysteries, Teacher of the nations, with

<p>Believers, in hymns let us honour Christ&#146;s Disciple, wise writer of the Gospel,
fair living imprint of the vessel of election, whose praise is in all the Churches, Luke
the Apostle. For he proclaimed the marvellous wonders of God, enlightening those on earth
with beams of theology through grace.</p>

<p>Wise Apostle, having learnt the skill of healing souls above that of bodies, infused
with the wisdom of God you were revealed as outstanding in both. By it you heal both souls
and bodies, all-blessed Luke. Each day you summon mortals to knowledge and give them wings
towards the love of God; you lead them up to heaven and you intercede for those who sing
your praise.</p>

<p>With a rational hook you drew to divine knowledge those who like fish had sunk in the
deep of ignorance, and you offered them to Christ as a fair dish, all-blessed one; and
they received outstanding honour: the life that is unsullied and unending. So too you were
named an Apostle of Christ, wise Evangelist and writer of the works of Grace realised in
acts.</font></p>

<p>Come all creation, let us praise in songs the true spiritual physician and Disciple of
the Saviour, Luke the revered. For he healed the disease of godlessness with the ointment
of the baptismal font of Christ; and from his mouth he has poured on living lands rivers
of waters welling up from God, the Gospel. Therefore his sound has out prophetically into
the inhabited world, and he intercedes that our souls may be saved.</p>

<p>Like David let us the faithful, gathered together, cry out in songs to Luke the
mystical orator of the Word: Your tongue has been revealed as a pen of Christ the swiftly
writing scribe, making fair the eyes of the nations for the knowledge of divine
understanding, by which you proclaimed the Gospel and composed the Acts of your fellow
Apostles. And so, as you stand before God, the Trinity, intercede for our souls.</p>
