<p>The Prophet saw you as a shining lampstand, bearing Christ the spiritual 
lamp, through whom we, who lay in the darkness of evils, have been enlightened, 
O Mother of God, as we call you blessed.</p>

<p>Disciples of the Saviour, when you had become eye-witnesses of mysteries you 
proclaimed the One who is not seen and who has no beginning, saying, ‘In the 
beginning was the Word’. You were not created before the Angels, you did not 
learn from men, but from the wisdom from on high. And so as you have freedom to 
speak, intercede on behalf of our souls.</p>
<p>Let us praise harmoniously in songs the Apostles of the Lord; for clothed 
with the panoply of the Cross they destroyed the error of idols and were 
declared crowned victors; at their intercessions, O God, have mercy on us.</p>

<p>As they were being tortured the Saints rejoiced and cried out: These are 
contracts for us with the Master; for instead of the stripes which assail the 
body, he will place on us a garment of light at the resurrection; instead of 
prison cells there will be Paradise; and instead of condemnation with 
malefactors, life with the Angels. At their prayers, Lord, save our souls.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</font><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>You who were chosen beforehand, hearken to our voice, and grant our souls our 
requests; deliver us from passions and pains through the Apostles; as Mother of 
God you can do all things.</p>
