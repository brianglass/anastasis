<p>Psalm 103<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you have
been greatly magnified. You have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping
yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his
upper chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind,
making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its
sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle;
waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at
the voice of your thunder. The mountains rise and the plains descend to the place which
you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return
to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the
mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await
them to quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling:
and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will
be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green
herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the
human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human heart.
The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There
the sparrows will build their nests; the heron&#146;s dwelling is at their head. The high
mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the
seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night,
in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to
seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they will lie
down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How
your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth
has been filled with your creation. Also this great, wide sea; there there are creeping
things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go to and fro; this
dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to you to give them their food
in due season. When you give it them, they will gather it. When you open your hand all
things will be filled with goodness. But when you turn away your face they will be
troubled. You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust.
You will send forth your spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of
the earth. May the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his
works. He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they
smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. May my
words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners
might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no more. Bless the Lord, my
soul!</font></p>

Our feet were standing in your courts, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem built as a city, shared by
all together. For there the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord, a testimony for

thrones over the house of David. Ask then for the things which are for Jerusalem&#146;s
peace, and prosperity for those who love you. May there be peace then in your power and

took pity on him, &#145;This must be one of the Hebrews&#146; children,&#146; she said.

<p>One day when Job&#146;s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the eldest
brother&#146;s house, a messenger came to Job and said, &#145;The oxen were ploughing and
the she-asses were feeding beside them, and marauders fell on them and carried them off,
and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; I alone have escaped to tell
you.&#146; While he was still speaking, another messenger came to Job and said, &#145;Fire
fell from heaven onto the earth and burned up the sheep and the shepherds, and consumed
them; I alone have escaped to tell you.&#146; While he was still speaking, another
messenger came to Job and said, &#145;The horsemen formed three columns, made a raid on
the camels and carried them off, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; I
alone have escaped to tell you.&#146; While he was still speaking, another messenger came
to Job and said, &#145;Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their
eldest brother&#146;s house, and suddenly a great wind came across the desert, struck the
four corners of the house, and it fell on your children, and they are died; I alone have
escaped to tell you.&#146; When he heard this Job arose, tore his clothes, shaved his
head, and fell on the ground and worshipped the Lord. He said, &#145;Naked I came from my
mother&#146;s womb, and naked shall I return there; the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken
away; as it seemed good to the Lord, so it has come to pass; blessed be the name of the
Lord to the ages.&#146; In all this Job did not sin before the Lord, nor with his lips;
nor did he charge God with folly.</font></p>

<p>The Lord said to his Disciples, &#145;But about that day and hour no one knows, neither
the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. For as the days of Noë were, so
will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were
eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noë entered the ark,
and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the
coming of the Son of Man. Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be
left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left.
Watch therefore, for you do not know at what hour your Lord is coming. But know this: if
the owner of the house had known at which watch of the night the thief was coming, he
would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also
must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not expect him. Who
then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom his lord has put in charge of his servants,
to give them their food at the proper time? Blessed is that slave whom his lord will find
doing this when he comes. Amen I say to you, he will put him in charge of all his
possessions. But if that wicked slave says in his heart, &#145;My master is delayed,&#146;
and he begins to beat his fellow slaves, and eats and drinks with drunkards, the lord of
that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour that he does not
know. He will cut him in pieces and his portion will be with the hypocrites, where there
will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten
virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were prudent,
and five were foolish. When the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them; but
the prudent took oil in their flasks with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed, all
of them became drowsy and slept. But at midnight there was a shout, &#145;See! The
bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him.&#146; Then all those virgins got up and
trimmed their lamps. The foolish said to the prudent, &#145;Give us some of your oil, for
our lamps are going out.&#146; But the wise replied, &#145;No! there will not be enough
for us and for you; you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.&#146;
And while they went to buy it, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went with him
into the wedding banquet; and the door was shut. Later the other virgins came also,
saying, &#145;Lord, Lord, open to us.&#146; But he replied, &#145;Amen I say to you, I do
not know you.&#146; Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour. For it is
as if a man, going on a journey, summoned his slaves and handed over his property to them;
to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his
ability. Then he went away. The one who had received the five talents went off and traded
with them, and made five more talents. In the same way, the one who had the two talents
made two more talents. But the one who had received the one talent went off and dug a hole
in the ground and hid his lord&#146;s money. After a long time the lord of those slaves
came and settled accounts with them. Then the one who had received the five talents came
forward, bringing five more talents, saying, &#145;Lord, you handed over to me five
talents; see, I have made five more talents.&#146; His lord said to him, &#145;Well done,
good and faithful slave; you have been faithful in a few things, I will put you in charge
of many; enter into the joy of your lord.&#146; And the one with the two talents also came
forward, saying, &#145;Lord, you handed over to me two talents; see, I have made two more
talents.&#146; His lord said to him, &#145;Well done, good and faithful slave; you have
been faithful in a few things, I will put you in charge of many; enter into the joy of
your lord.&#146; Then the one who had received the one talent also came forward, saying,
&#145;Lord, I knew that you were a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering
where you did not scatter seed; so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the
ground. Here you have what is yours.&#146; But his lord replied, &#145;You wicked and lazy
slave! You knew, did you, that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not
scatter? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and on my return I
would have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him, and give
it to the one with the ten talents. For to all those who have, more will be given, and
they will have an abundance; but from those who have nothing, even what they have will be
taken away from them. As for this worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness,
where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.&#146; When the Son of Man comes in his

the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from another as a
shepherd separates the sheep from the goats, and he will put the sheep at his right hand
and the goats at the left. Then the king will say to those at his right hand, &#145;Come,
you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave
me to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I
was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.&#146; Then the just will
answer him, &#145;Lord, when did we see you hungry and gave you food, or thirsty and gave
you to drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcomed you, or naked and gave you
clothing? And when did we saw you sick or in prison and came to you?&#146; And the king
will answer them, &#145;Amen I say to you, just as you did it to one of the least of these
my brethren, you did it to me.&#146; Then he will say to those at his left hand, &#145;You
that are accursed, depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his
angels; for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to
drink, I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not give me
clothing, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.&#146; Then they also will answer,
&#145;Lord, when was it that we saw you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick
or in prison, and did not serve you?&#146; Then he will answer them, &#145;Amen I say to
you, just as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to
me.&#146; And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the just into eternal
life.&#146; When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
&#145;You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be
handed over to be crucified.&#146;</font></p>

<p>Then, as the Priest distributes the Antidoron,</p>

<p>Psalm 33</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">I will bless the Lord at all times, his praise shall
always be in my mouth. In the Lord my soul will be praised; let the meek hear it and
rejoice. Magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. I sought the Lord
and he heard me, and he delivered me from all my afflictions. Draw near to him and be
enlightened, and your faces shall not be ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard
him, and saved him from all his afflictions. The angel of the Lord will encamp round those
who fear him, and deliver them. Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed the man who
hopes in him! Fear the Lord, all you his saints, for there is not want for those who fear
him. The rich became have become poor and gone hungry, but those who seek the Lord will
not be deprived of any good. Come, my children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of
the Lord. Who is there who wants life, who loves to see good days? Keep your tongue from
evil, and your lips from speaking guile. Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and
pursue it. The eyes of the Lord are on the just, and his ears towards their supplication.
The Lord sets his face against those who do evil, to destroy their memory from the earth.
The just cried and the Lord heard them, and delivered them from all their afflictions. The
Lord is close to those who are broken-hearted, and he will save the humble in spirit. The
afflictions of the just are many, but the Lord will deliver them from them all. The Lord
guards all their bones; not one of them will be broken. The death of sinners is evil.
Those who hate the just will go astray. The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants,
and none who hope in him will go astray.</font></p>

<p>[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Psalm 144</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">I will exalt you, my God, my King; and I will bless
your name for ever and to age on age. Every day I will bless you; and praise your name for
ever and to age on age. The Lord is great and highly to be praised; and there is no limit
to his greatness. Generation after generation will praise your works; and will declare
your power. They will tell of the majesty of the glory of your holiness; and will recount
your wonders. They will speak of the power of your dread deeds; and will recount your
greatness. They will proclaim the memory of the multitude of your goodness; and rejoice in
your justice. The Lord is compassionate and merciful; long-suffering and full of mercy.
The Lord is good to all; and his acts of compassion are for all his works. May all your
works confess you, Lord; and all your holy ones bless you. They will speak of the glory of
your kingdom; and tell of your power. To make known your power and of the glory the
majesty of your kingdom to the children of mankind. Your kingdom is a kingdom for all the
ages, and your dominion for every generation. The Lord is faithful in all his words, and
holy in all his works. The Lord supports all who are falling, and sets upright all who are
broken down. The eyes of all hope in you, and you give them their food in due season. You
open your hand, and fill every living thing with your good pleasure. The Lord is just in
all his ways, and holy in all his works. The Lord is close to those who call on him, to
all who call on him in truth. He will do the will of those who fear him, and hear their
supplication and save them. The Lord guards all who love him, and all sinners he will
destroy. My mouth will tell the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his holy name
for ever and to age on age. </font></p>
