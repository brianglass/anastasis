<p>The Cross of the Lord for those who worship it unswervingly is a bridle on
every pleasure and a law of self-mastery. For as they gaze unceasingly on the
One who was nailed to it, they crucify the flesh with its passions and desires.
As we too hurry from them through pure fasting, let us become his own, who in
love for humankind became our own by the passion and gave us a share in the
nature of his own dispassion, he who has great mercy.</p>

<p>Verse 1. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">To you I lift up my eyes,
to you who are enthroned in the heavens. As the eyes of servants look to the
hand of their master: or as the eyes of a maid toward the hand of her mistress,
so our eyes look to the Lord our God: until he show us his mercy.</p>

<p>Pure Virgin, when you saw the ripe Grape Cluster that you had carried in your
womb unhusbanded hanging on the Tree, lamenting you bewailed him and cried out,
‘My Child, drop down sweetness, through which may all the drunkenness of the
passions be abolished, O Benefactor, by divine supplications through me who gave
you birth, for you are compassionate’.</p>
