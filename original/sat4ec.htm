<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You conceived without seed, and ineffably you bore the One who put down the mighty from
their throne and exalts the humble and raises the horn of his faithful ones, who glorify
the Cross and the Tomb and the glorious Resurrection of Christ. Therefore, Mother of God,
with never silent hymns we call you blessed, the source of such great goods, as you ever
intercede that our souls may be saved.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Aposticha. Prosomia of the Mother of God.<br>
Called from the highest.</p>

<p>Verse: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">I shall remember your name in every
generation and generation.</p>

<p>God, the Son begotten without time from the Father who has no beginning, through
condescension and for the salvation of mortals became man, that he might now grant
Paradise to the First-formed and at the same time redeem all nature from the deception of
the serpent and save the fallen image as he is easily placated. Therefore he made his
Mother the Pure undefiled Mother of the Bridegroom, whom we have all gained as the anchor
of our souls.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Listen, daughter, and see, and incline
your ear; and forget your people and your father&#146;s house.</p>

<p>You held in your womb, O blessed of God, the incarnate Creator of all things as he
refashioned humankind, which through the serpent had once fallen by the transgression. For
you gave birth ineffably in the flesh to our God, and through your bearing child you freed
from corruption all nature that had grown old. Therefore we praise and glorify your grace,
Virgin without bridegroom, as we implore that through you we may be delivered from every
punishment.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> The rich among the people of the land
will entreat your favour.</p>

<p>That you may reveal to us all the multitude of your mercy and the limitless ocean of
your loving-kindness, wipe away the sins of your servants. For as you are Mother of God, O
All-blameless, you have authority over creation and by your power you order all things as
you will; for the grace of the holy Spirit clearly dwells in you and with you is at in all
things everlastingly, O All-blessed.</p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Son who with the Father and the Spirit is glorified in the highest by the Seraphim,
wishing to refashion the First-formed, ineffably emptied his whole self in your womb, O
all-praised Mother of God. Dawning from you he enlightened the whole world by his Godhead,
delivering it from the folly of idols, and by this Christ God and the Saviour of our souls
made humanity divine and brought it up to heaven.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Resurrection Apolytikion, and the Dismissal.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Book Antiqua" size="5">AT GREAT VESPERS</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">After the Opening Psalm and the
first Kathisma of the Psalter, at </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord I have
cried&#133;, </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">we insert 10
Stichera, and we sing 7 Resurrection Stichera and 3 from the Menaion.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Resurrection Stichera. Tone 4.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>As we worship without ceasing your life-giving Cross, Christ God, we glorify your
Resurrection on the third day, for through it, O All-powerful, you renewed corrupted human
nature and showed us the way up to heaven, as you alone are good and love mankind.</p>

<p>By being willingly nailed to the tree of the Cross, O Saviour, you abolished the
penalty of the tree of disobedience; and by descending into Hades, O Powerful one, you
tore apart the bonds of death as God; therefore we worship your Resurrection from the
dead, as we cry out with joy: all-powerful Lord, glory to you!</p>

<p>You smashed the gates of Hell, Lord, and by your death you destroyed the palace of
death; while you freed humanity from corruption, granting the world life and incorruption,
and your great mercy.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Other Verses by Anatolios.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Come you peoples, let us hymn the Saviour's Rising on the third day, through which we
were redeemed from unbreakable bonds of Hell and all received incorruption and life, as we
cry: You, who were crucified and buried and rose again, save us by your Resurrection, only
lover of mankind.</p>

<p>Angels and mortals hymn your Rising on the third day, O Saviour, through which the ends
of the inhabited world were filled with light, and we were all redeemed from the slavery
of the foe, as we cry: O life-giving, all-powerful Saviour, save us by your Resurrection,
only lover of mankind.</p>

<p>You shattered the gates of brass and smashed their bars, Christ God, and you raised the
fallen human race; therefore with one voice we cry: Lord risen from the dead, glory to
you!</p>

<p>O Lord, your birth from your Father is without time and eternal; your incarnation from
a Virgin is inexpressible for humans and beyond explanation; and your descent into Hell is
fearful for the devil and his angels; for having trampled on death you rose on the third
day, granting mankind incorruption and your great mercy.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Prophet David, through you the ancestor of God, spoke of you in song beforehand to
him who has done great things for you: the Queen stood at your right hand. For he, the God
who was well pleased without father to become man from you, declared you to be mother,
source of life, that he might refashion his own image, corrupted by passions, and, having
found the lost sheep wandering on the mountain and laid it on his shoulders, he might
bring it to his Father; and by his own will unite it to the heavenly Powers and save the
world, O Mother of God, Christ who has great and rich mercy.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Resurrection Stichera of the Aposticha.<br>
Tone 4.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Lord, by ascending the Cross you wiped out our ancestral curse, and by descending into
Hades you freed those enchained from every age, granting incorruption to the human race;
therefore with hymns we glorify your life-giving and saving Rising.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">In Alphabetical Order.</p>

<p>Verse 1: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The Lord is King: he has robed
himself in majesty. The Lord has robed and girded himself with power.</p>

<p>Hanged upon a tree, O only Mighty One, you shook creation; laid in a tomb you raised
those who dwelt in tombs, granting the human race incorruption and life; therefore with
hymns we glorify your Rising on the third day.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse 2:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> He has made the world firm; it will
not be shaken.</p>

<p>A lawless people, O Christ, delivered you to Pilate, and condemned you to be crucified,
showing themselves unfeeling to their benefactor, but of your own will you endured burial,
rose on the third by your own power, as God granting us unending life and your great
mercy.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse 3: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Holiness befits your house, O Lord,
to length of days.</p>

<p>Reaching your grave in tears the women looked for you; and when they did not find you
they cried aloud with grief and lamentation: Alas, our Saviour, King of all, how were you
stolen? What sort of place holds your life-bearing body? But an Angel answered them and
said: Do not weep, but go, proclaim that the Lord has risen, granting us joy, as he alone
is compassionate.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Look upon the supplication of your servants, O All-unblemished, bringing to an end the
dread assaults that beset us and calming all our distress; for we have only you as safe
and sure anchor, and we have obtained your protection. Sovereign Lady, may we who entreat
you not be put to shame; make haste to hear the supplication of us who cry to you with
faith: Hail, Sovereign Lady, help, joy and protection of all, and salvation of our souls.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Resurrection Apolytikion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>When the women Disciples of the Lord learned from the Angel the joyful message of the
Resurrection and cast away the ancestral sentence, triumphantly they said to the Apostles:
Death has been despoiled, Christ God has risen, granting the world his great mercy.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The mystery hidden from all eternity and unknown to Angels, has been revealed to those
on earth through you, O Mother of God: God being made flesh in a union without confusion,
and willingly accepting the Cross for us, through which he raised the first-formed man and
saved our souls from death.</font></p>
