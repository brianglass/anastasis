<p>The Spirit-inspired preachers, the Disciples of the Saviour, having become by faith
instruments of the Spirit, distributed the holy proclamation, sowing it with right belief,
to the ends of the earth, from which, by God&#146;s husbandry and grace, have sprung up
the armies of Martyrs, who form an image of the holy Passion through many kinds of
tortures, scourgings and fire; and with boldness they intercede on behalf of our souls.</p>

<p>Burning with the fire of the love of the Lord, they despised fire, and as lighted
godlike coals the holy Martyrs by Christ burned up the brushwood insolence of error; while
they stopped the mouths of wild beasts by wise entreaties, and when their heads were cut
off they cut down all the regiments of the foe; and valiantly pouring out the streams of
their blood they watered the Church, which then blossomed with faith.</p>

<p>The valiant Martyrs wrestled with wild beasts, were struck with swords, raked with
claws, their hands were cut off and they were racked; without yielding they were burned
with material fire, they were pierced and their joints were severed. They bore all most
valiantly, as they looked forward to their coming rest, the pure crowns and the glory of
Christ; to whom with boldness they intercede on behalf of our souls.</p>

<p>Let us, as is fitting, praise with sacred songs those who have competed by faith in all
the ends of the earth, Apostles, Martyrs, godly-minded Priests, holy Women, a sacred
gathering; for earthly beings were united with the heavenly and by suffering received
through Christ&#146;s grace dispassion; and now like fixed stars their shed their light on
us, as with boldness they intercede on behalf of our souls.</p>

[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">43:9-14<sup>a</sup></font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: All the nations have been assembled and rulers from them shall be
assembled; who will declare these things among them? or who will make heard to you the
things from the beginning? Let them bring their witnesses and let them be justified, and
them hear and let them speak what is true. Be my witnesses, and I too am a witness, says
the Lord God, and my servant whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe me, and
understand that I AM; before me there was no other God, and after me there will not be. I
am God, and apart from me there is none who saves. I have declared and I have saved; I
reproved, and there was no strange god among you. You are my witnesses and I am a witness,
says the Lord God. Again from the beginning I AM, and there is none who can deliver from
my hands; I will make, and who will turn it back? Thus says the Lord God who redeems us,
the holy one of Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the Wisdom of Solomon.<br>
[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">3:1-9</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>The souls of the just are in the hand of God, and no torment will touch them. In the
eyes of fools they seemed to die and their departure was reckoned a disaster and their
going from us their destruction; but they are at peace. For though in the sight of men
they were punished, their hope is full of immortality. Having been disciplined a little,
they will receive great good, because God tested them and found them worthy of himself.
Like gold in the furnace he tried them and like a whole burnt offering he accepted them.
And in the time of their visitation they will shine forth, and will run like sparks
through stubble. They will judge nations and rule over peoples, and the Lord will reign
over them forever. Those who trust in him will understand truth, and the faithful will
abide with him in love, because grace and mercy are upon his holy ones and visitation on
his elect.</p>

[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">5:16-6:3<sup>b</sup></font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>The just live for ever, and their reward is with the Lord; the Most High takes care of
them. Therefore they will receive a glorious crown and a beautiful diadem from the hand of
the Lord, because with his right hand he will cover them, and with his arm he will shield
them. He will take his zeal as his whole armour, and will arm all creation to repel his
enemies; he will put on righteousness as a breastplate, and will wear impartial justice as
a helmet; he will take holiness as an invincible shield, and sharpen stern wrath for a
sword, and creation will join with him to fight against his frenzied foes. Shafts of
lightning will fly with true aim, and will leap from the clouds to the target, as from a
well-drawn bow, and hailstones full of wrath will be hurled as from a catapult; the water
of the sea will rage against them, and rivers will relentlessly overwhelm them; a mighty
wind will rise against them, and like a tempest it will winnow them away. Lawlessness will
lay waste the whole earth, and evil-doing will overturn the thrones of rulers. Listen,
therefore, O kings, and understand; learn, O judges of the ends of the earth. Give ear,
you that rule over multitudes, and boast of many nations. For your dominion was given you
from the Lord, and your sovereignty from the Most High.</font></p>

Christ our God, supremely good, at their prayers grant peace to your Churches, victories
over enemies to our Christ-loving Sovereign, and to our souls your great mercy.</p>

<p>Come, let us rejoice in spirit at the memorial of the Saints; for see, it has come
bringing us gifts of grace in rich abundance; and so with a voice of gladness and a pure
conscience let us cry out and say: Hail, company of Prophets, who proclaimed the coming of
Christ to the world and foresaw near at hand things far off. Hail, choir of Apostles, who
caught the nations in a net, and who are the fishers of mankind. Hail, race of Martyrs,
who were gathered from the ends of the into one faith, endured for it fierce torments and
finally received the crown of your contest. Hail, swarm of Fathers, who trampled down your
own bodies by ascetic struggle, and when you had slain the passions of the flesh you gave
wings to your mind with divine love and took flight to heaven, and as you rejoice with the
Angels, you enjoy eternal blessings. But, O Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs with Ascetics,
insistently implore the one who crowned you that those who celebrate with faith and love
your ever-revered memorial may be rescued from enemies visible and invisible.</p>

a mystical wine-bowl are set before us, filled with sweet foods of joy: the virtues of the
Martyrs; for these brave-hearted ones from the ends of the earth offered to God as a
rational sacrifice the many tortures of their bodily extremities and the prime of their
years; some had their heads cut off, others were dismembered of hands and of every joint
together; all the Saints became partakers of Christ&#146;s sufferings. But Lord, who gave
them crowns as rewards of their torments, count us worthy to live according to their
example, as you love mankind.</p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>On this day, the Sunday after Pentecost, we celebrate the feast of all the Saints from
throughout the inhabited world, in Asia, Libya and Europe, in North and South.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Verses</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">I sing the praise of each friend of my Lord,</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">If any would, let them now list them all.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>Our most godlike Fathers decreed that we should celebrate the present feast after the
descent of the All-holy Spirit, as showing in a certain way that the coming of the
All-holy Spirit acted through the Apostles like this: sanctifying and making wise human
beings taken from our mortal clay and, for the completion of that fallen angelic order,
restoring them and through Christ sending them to God, some by the witness of martyrdom
and blood, others by their virtuous conduct and way of life; and things beyond nature are
achieved. For the Spirit descends in the form of fire, whose natural momentum is upwards;
while dust, whose natural momentum is downwards, ascends on high, that dust which forms
our mortal clay, the flesh added to and made divine by God the Word, which a short time
before, had been exalted and taken its seat at the right hand of the Father&#146;s glory.
But he now also draws all those who wish, according to the promise, just as God the Word
had manifested the works of reconciliation and what was the end, most suitable to its
purpose, of his coming to us through flesh and of his dispensation, namely that he brings
those who were rejected before to union and friendship with God &#151; human nature
offering to God the ungrateful people from the nations like first fruits &#151;those who
were outstandingly well-pleasing to him. This is one reason that we celebrate the feast of
All Saints.</p>

<p>A second reason is because, though many people have been well-pleasing to God, they
were through outstanding virtue unknown to humanity by name, or for some human reason or
other, but nevertheless have great glory in God&#146;s sight. Or again, because there are
many who have lived following Christ in India, Egypt, Arabia. Mesopotamia and Phrygia and
in the lands beyond the Black Sea, even as far as the British Isles themselves; in short,
in both East and West, but it was not easy to honour them all properly because of their
vast numbers, in the way that ecclesiastical custom has been received. And therefore, so
that we may attract the help of them all, wherever on earth they were well-pleasing to
God, and generally for those who would later become Saints, the most godly Fathers
ordained that we should celebrate the feast of All Saints, honouring the earlier and later
ones, the unknown and the known &#151; all those in whom the Holy Spirit has dwelt he has
made holy.</p>

<p>A third reason is this. It was necessary for the Saints who are celebrated individually
day by day to be gathered together on one day, in order to demonstrate that, as they
struggled for the one Christ and all ran the race in the same stadium of virtue, so they
were all fittingly crowned as servants of one God and sustained the Church, having filled
the world on high. They stir us also to accomplish the same struggle in its different and
many forms, to the degree of power that each of us has to press onwards with all
eagerness.</p>

<p>For all these Saints from every age the revered and wise Emperor Leo erected and vast
and very beautiful church. This is very near the church of the holy Apostles, within the
city of Constantine. He built it originally, it is said, for his first wife Theophano, who
was outstandingly well-pleasing to God, which was indeed a marvel in the midst of turmoil
and in royal palaces. When he informed the Church of his idea, he did not succeed in
making it agree with his wishes</p>

<p>The most wise Emperor, with the approval of the whole Church, dedicated to all the
Saints everywhere in the world the building that had been erected, observing that
&#145;Since Theophano is a Saint, let her be numbered with the rest. &#145;</p>

<p>Note that we are celebrating everything that the Holy Spirit, in giving good things,
has made holy. I mean the highest and sanctifying Minds, that is to say the Nine Orders;
the Ancestors and Patriarchs; the Prophets and sacred Apostles; the Martyrs and Hierarchs;
the Priest Martyrs and Ascetic Martyrs; the Ascetics and the Just and all the choirs of
holy women and all the other anonymous Saints, with them let there be all who will come
afterwards. But before all, in all and with all, the Saint of Saints, the most holy and
quite incomparably mightier than the angelic Orders, our Lady and Sovereign, Mary,
Ever-Virgin.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>At the prayers of your all-pure Mother, Christ God, and of all your Saints from every
age, have mercy and save us, for you alone are good and love mankind. Amen.</font></p>

each their desserts and apportioning crowns, then count all worthy to sing to you: Blessed
