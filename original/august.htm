<p align="center"><font size="6" face="Book Antiqua">THE MONTH OF AUGUST</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">[</font><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">It has 31 days. The day has 13 hours and the night 11</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><strong>1. The procession of the
precious and life-giving Cross, and commemoration of the seven holy youths, the Maccabees,
and their mother Solomoni, and of their teacher Eleazar.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">During the month of August, as diseases were
particularly frequent, it was formerly the custom in Constantinople for the precious Wood
of the Cross to be carried through the streets and squares of the city during these days
to sanctify the place and to drive away diseases. On the thirty first of July they brought
the Cross from the royal treasury and placed it on the Holy Table of the Great Church (of
the Holy Wisdom). On the next day and on each subsequent day until the feast of the
Dormition of the Mother of God they processed with it throughout the whole city and
exposed it for the veneration of the people. This is what is called the &#145;Progress of
the Precious Cross&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The holy Maccabees, whose names are, Aveim, Antony,
Gourias, Eleazar, Efsevonas, Acheim and marcellus, were Jews by race and strict observers
of the ancestral laws. They flourished in the days of Antiochus, known as
&#145;Epiphanes&#146;, king of Syria and a merciless enemy of the Jews. He enslaved their
whole nation and committed many evil deeds, even against the sacred acts of their religion
itself. Among other things he compelled them to eat swine&#146;s flesh, which is forbidden
by the law. It was then that these devout youths, who had been arrested with their mother
and their teacher and ordered to abandon the precepts of the law, were subjected to ten
thousand torments, as many as a tyrannical and savage imagination could think up. When
they had nobly endured all these and shown through their deeds that reason is the ruler of
the passions and can conquer them, if it wills to, they met their end gloriously in the
midst of torments, giving up their lives for the observance the law of God; first their
aged teacher Eleazar, then all the brothers in order of age. Their wonderful mother,
Solomoni, filled with noble thoughts and rousing her woman&#146;s mind with manly fervour
(2 Maccabees 7,21), stood by the triumph of her children over the tyrant, encouraging each
of them to the struggle for the faith and bravely enduring their pains through her hope in
the Lord. When she saw that her youngest son had met his end, she threw herself last of
all into the fire and was granted the same blessed end along with her children, in the
year 168 before Christ.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">After the stoning of the Protomartyr by the Jews who
had killed Christ (27 December), Gamaliel, his teacher, encouraged some of the Christians
to come by night, rake the Saint&#146;s body and bury it in his own field, which after
fifteen miles distant from Jerusalem and called after him &#145;Kaphar-Gamaliel&#146;,
that is, &#145; Gamaliel&#146;s field&#146;, where Gamaliel himself was later buried. In
the year 427 a devout man, named Lukianos, who was a priest and the one in charge of a
church beside this field, received through a vision a revelation from God that the place
was where the Protomartyr was buried, and he at once informes John, who was then patriarch
of Jerusalem. They went to the place indicated and after digging found a coffin inscribed
in Hebrew, &#145;Stephen&#146;. They opened it and taking the most sacred remains
transferred them to Jerusalem with great pomp.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><strong>3. Of our venerable fathers Isaakios,
Dalmatos and Faustus.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Of these Isaakios, whose name is also found written
as Isakios and Isakes and who is celebrated in particular on 30 May, became a monk from
his youth, a worker of every virtue and a zealot for the Orthodox faith. He was granted
the gift of prophecy. He dwelt in a small hut near Constantinople. When Vales, the Arian
sympathiser, led a expedition in person against the Goths around the Danube, the Saint
came out to meet him and with bold freedom of speech told him that God had stirred up the
barbarians against him because he in turn had stirred up many voices to blasphemy against
God and had driven those who sang God&#146;s praise from the churches; and that, if he
stopped making war on God through heresy and returned the noble shepherds to Christ&#146;s
flock, he would easily gain the victory. But if he did not do this, so not having God as
his ally, and joined battle , the disaster of him and his army was certain. &#145;You will
learn&#146;, he said, &#145;that it is hard to kick against the goad, for you will not
return and you will lose the army.&#146; But the emperor was enraged and shut the Saint in
prison so that he might punish him and put him to death when he returned after defeating
the barbarians. But he was comprehensively defeated and burned alive in a certain village
in 378 (Theodore of Cyrrhus, Ecclesiastical History 4,31-32). The Saint was let out of
prison and was a source of wonder because of his prophecy, but even more so because of his
zeal for Orthodoxy, which he displayed at the Second Ecumenical Council in 381. After
this, a monastery having been erected in Constantinople for his sake, he shepherded his
fellow ascetics devoutly, and, having given them a model of the monastic way of life, his
own example, he fell asleep in peace around the end of the fourth century, leaving
Dalmatos as his successor.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Dalmatos had originally been a soldier, enlisted
with the 2nd Company of the soldiers called Scolarii. Later he gave up everything and,
taking his son Faustus, he left for the above mentioned monastery of Isaakios, where he
was clothed with the monastic habit and become revered by all for his virtue. He was
present at the 3rd Ecumenical Council, called in Ephesus in 431. There he displayed his
orthodox zeal against Nestorios and was elected by the fathers of the Synod as
archimandrite of the monasteries in Constantinople. He lived for 80 years and rested in
the Lord.</font></p>

<h3><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">5. Forefeast of the Transfiguration of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and commemoration of the holy Martyr Efsignios.</font></h3>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Martyr was from Antioch, a soldier by rank from
the time of Constantine Chlorus, father of Constantine the Great, until that of Julian the
Apostate. He upbraided the latter for his impiety and reminded him that he was the nephew
of Constantine the Great, the first Christian Emperor, that from his tenderest years he
had been nourished with the milk of true religion, had been taught the Christian faith,
had been the fellow student of Basil the Great and Gregory Nazianzen and had become a
reader in the church of Nikomedia; and that, having already abandoned all this and become
an apostate, he offered to idols the worship that was due to God alone. When he had
reminded the apostate of all this by way of reproach, he was beheaded around 381, having
lived altogether for 110 years and more than 60 as a soldier. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><img src="tr-gr1A.jpg" border="3" width="177" height="248"></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Since the Lord had often spoken beforehand to his
Disciples not only about his own Passion, Cross and death, but also about the persecutions
and afflictions that awaited the Disciples themselves; and since, on the one hand, these
terrible events were imminent, but on the other so was the coming and hoped for enjoyment
of blessings instead of them, he therefore, in order to let them see with their own eyes
the glory that had been prepared for those who endured to the end, he took his three
chosen Disciples, Peter, James and John, and led them apart up Mt Thabor, where he was
transfigured in their presence. His face shone like the sun and his garments became white
like light. Suddenly amid this outpouring of supernatural and remarkable light, there
appeared the leading Prophets, Moses and Elias, talking with Jesus about his coming saving
passion, and revealing at the same time that he is the Lord of both the living and the
dead, for they had come to stand in his presence like servants, Moses from Hades, as he
had died many ages before (Cf. 4 September), while Elias as though from heaven, to which
he had been taken up alive (Cf. 20 July). After a little while a cloud of light
overshadowed them and from the cloud the same voice that had been heard in the Jordan (Cf.
6 January) was heard, testifying to Jesus&#146; divinity and saying, &#145;This is my
beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased. Hear him.&#146; (Matt. 17,1-5). These are the
divine and wondrous events of the present feast, which is an icon and foreshadowing of the
condition of the just that is to come, whose splendour the Lord revealed when he said,
&#145;The just will shine out like the sun&#146; (Matt. 13,43).This is why the Kontakion
of this feast is sung every day at the Hours [in the Typika], as a permanent reminder of
that glory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">He was a Persian by race and lived in the time of
Constantine the Great. He was at first an idolater, but, having been instructed by a
Christian named Avaros, he left for Nisibis, a town in Mesopotamia, where he was baptised
and clothed in the monastic habit in a certain monastery. Later he climbed a mountain and
there led an austerely ascetic life, performing miracles for those who came to him and
converting many unbelievers. When he learnt this, Julian the Apostate, during his
expedition against the Persians in 363, sent and had him stoned together with his two
disciples as they were singing the Third Hour.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">After the traitor Judas had received the reward for

shameful death &#151; he fell from where he was hanging, his stomach split open and all
his entrails were poured out. Then, to make up the number of the Twelve, all the
Saviour&#146;s Disciples, who were all together after the Ascension, men and women
together, about 120, chose two men from among them, Joseph called Barsbabas, who was
surnamed &#145;Justsus&#146;, that is &#145;Just&#146;, and Matthias. They stood them the
midst and when they had prayed to God the drew lots and the lot fell on Matthias and he
was numbered with the eleven Apostles (Matt. 17,5. Acts 1,15-26). An so Matthias, having
filled Judas&#146;s empty place and the work of his apostolate, fulfilled the prophecy
which the Holy Spirit had made through David&#146;s mouth, &#145;Let his quarters become
empty and let another take his office&#146; (Psalm 68,25. 108,8). After this, it is said,
Matthias preached the Gospel in Ethiopia, where he met a martyr&#146;s death.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">He was Archdeacon of the Church of Rome and had
charge of its treasures and of distributing money to the poor. When Valerian launched a
ferocious persecution against the Christians and Xystos, or Sixtus II, Pope of the elder
Rome, had died by crucifixion, Laurence was arrested and led before the magistrate. When
he was questioned about the Church&#146;s treasures he asked leave for three days grace to
assemble them. He then assembled all destitute and presented them to the magistrate,
&#145;There&#146;, he said, &#145;are the Church&#146;s treasures&#146;. At this the
magistrate was enraged and ordered him to be stretched out on a red hot grid iron. When
Christ&#146;s noble champion had endured this without a sound and was being burnt on one
side, he said, &#145;Turn me over, so that I may be well and truly roasted&#146;. When
this had been done, the Martyr said to the tyrants, &#145;Taste then and see ifthe flesh
of the Christians is sweeter roasted rather than raw. When he had said this and prayed
like Christ for his persecutors and executioners, he gave up his spirit on 10 August, 258.</font></p>

died in 698 bc. From this it is clear that he is not the Micheas, son of Jemblaa, or
Jembla [3 Reigns 22], who rebuked Achab and was slain by his son Joram, according to the
Synaxaristes, because this Joram reigned in 896 bc, while Micheas, as has been said, was
still prophesying in the days of Ezekias, who was a contemporary of Osee, last king of the
twelve tribes of Israel, in whose reign that kingdom was overthrown by Salmanasar, king of
Assyria [4 Reigns 17,1-16 and 18,1]. This Micheas is the sixth of the twelve Minor

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Concerning the Dormition of the Mother of God the
Church has received the following from the ancient tradition of the Fathers. When the time
drew near when it was our Saviour&#146;s good pleasure to take to himself his own Mother,
he informed her through an Angel, three days before hand, of her passing from this
temporary life to that which is eternal and blessed. When she heard this, she went in
haste to the mount of Olives, where it was her custom to go and pray, and when she had
given thanks to God, she returned to her house and prepared for her burial. Meanwhile
clouds had snatched up the Apostles from the ends of the earth, wherever each of them was
preaching, and set them down together at the house of the Mother of God. She quickly
explained to them the reason for their coming together and like a mother she consoled them
in their distress. Then she raised her hands to heaven, prayed for the peace of the world,
blessed the Apostles and then, when she had lain down on the bier and disposed her body as
she has intended, she placed her all-holy soul into the hands of her Son and God.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Apostles with devotion and great pomp took up
the bier of that body which had received God and chanting funeral hymns they took it to
the grave, when Angels from heaven began to sing with them, as they escorted her who is
higher than the Cherubim. One of Jews, out of envy, audaciously placed his hands on the
bier and at once received the punishment of his rashness, for his hands were cut off by an
invisible blow. When they reached the village called Gethsemane, they buried there with
honour the all-pure body, source of life, of the Mother of God. But on the third day after
the burial, as they were consoling one another together, they raised the loaf that had
been set out, as was their custom, in the name of Jesus, when the Mother of God appeared
in the air and said them, &#145;Hail!&#146;. From this they understood that the Mother of
God had been translated bodily into heaven.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">This is what the Church has received from the
traditions of the Fathers, and having set down many things from them in hymns, as a proof
of true devotion, it chants them this day to the glory of the Mother of our God.</font></p>

<h3><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">20. Of the holy Prophet Samuel.</font></h3>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">This most holy man was God&#146;s prophet from his
youth and the last of Israel&#146;s judges. He was from the city of Armathaim, of the
tribe of Levi, son of Eleazar and Anna and was born about 1155 bc. H was given the name
Samuel, which means &#145;requested from God&#146;, by his mother, because she was
previously barren and had asked God for a child with many prayers and fervent tears. After
she had given birth to him and weaned him, she brought him at once to the town of Silom,
where the divine Ark then was. Having offered him to God&#146;s ministry as an infant, in
accordance with her promise, she gave him thanks by chanting the Third canticle of the Old
Testament, &#145;My heart has been established in the Lord.&#146; Then she returned to her
home and gave birth subsequently to three more sons and two daughters. But Samuel remained
in Silom under the protection of Eli, who was then the High Priest of the Jews, serving at
God&#146;s tabernacle and by his most holy way of life being well-pleasing to both God and
men, according to the testimony of holy Scripture, &#145;And the boy Samuel advanced and
grew up and was in favour with both the Lord and men&#146; [1 Reigns 2,26]. This virtuous
boy was sleeping in the temple where the Ark of God was, and he heard a voice calling him
by name three and four times, &#145;Samuel, Samuel.&#146; It was God&#146;s voice
informing Samuel of his sentence concerning the impending disaster of Eli, because he,
having two sons called Ophni and Phineas, a pair of lawless youths who despised God, had
done nothing at all to correct them. This divine sentence was fulfilled in due time and
the family of Eli was destroyed in one day; a fearful warning to those who neglect the
proper upbringing of their own children and the necessary correction of their offences.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">After this Samuel was chosen as the protector of the
people, whom he judged with holiness and justice, becoming for them a model of good works
and considering the one great sin to be ceasing to pray for them and entreating God for
the forgiveness of their transgressions, as he said himself in the presence of them all,
&#145;Far be it from me to sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you. And I will
serve the Lord and show you the good and upright way&#146; [1 Reigns 12,23]. All confessed
to his justice and lack of love of gain, with which he governed the people and judged the
lawsuits of each, when he asked them, with God as his witness, that they tell him in
conscience if he had ever wronged anyone, or taken from anyone either property, money or
bribe even so much as a cheap sandal. They answered with one voice and said, &#145;You
have not wronged us, you have not oppressed us, you have not afflicted us and you have not
taken anything from anyone, [1 Reigns 12,2-4]. When the people asked for a king in his old
age, he anointed Saul, but when, shortly after, he disobeyed God&#146;s command, he
deposed him from the Lord&#146;s presence and went and anointed David, at God&#146;s
bidding. Having lived without blame in anything for 89 years and become a model to the
fathers of a life pleasing to God, he died in about 1075 bc. By the majority the books of
Judges and Ruth and the first 24 chapters of 1 Reigns are attributed to him.</font></p>

<h3><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">21. Of the holy Apostle Thaddaeus, and of the holy
Martyr Vassa.</font></h3>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Martyrs were from the city of Edessa in
Mesopotamia and were martyred under Maximianos in 290. The Apostle was also from Edessa, a
Jew by race, who came to Jerusalem and became a disciple of Christ, whom he followed until
the Passion. After the Ascension, in around 36 ad, he returned to his fatherland, where he
instructed and baptised the local ruler Abgar and healed him of an incurable disease, by
he was suffering greatly. Having preached in Mesopotamis, he met a martyr&#146;s death.
Some people say of him that he was one of the Twelve, the one whom Matthew calls Lebbaios,
surnamed Thaddaios [Matt. 7,31]. Eusebios, however, says that he was one of the Seventy
and writes this about him, &#145;After the Christ&#146;s resurrection and ascent into
heaven, Thomas, one of the twelve apostles, by a prompting from God, sent out Thaddaios,
who had been one of the seventy disciples of Christ, to Edessa as preacher and evangelist
of Christ&#146;s teaching, [History of the Church 1,13]. He writes the name
&#145;Agbar&#146;, which others give as &#145;Avgar&#146;.</font></p>

<h3><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">29. The Beheading of the holy, glorious Prophet,
Forerunner and Baptist John.</font></h3>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The godlike Baptist, the prophet and son of a
prophet, the seal of the prophets and the beginning of the apostles, the intermediary
between the old and new covenants, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, the
Messenger [Angel] of the incarnate Messias and his forerunner and the one who was to
prepare for his coming [Isaias 4,3. Malachy 3,1], conceived and born through many wonders,
filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother&#146;s womb, advancing like a second zealous
Elias, whose desert life and ascetic clothing of a leather belt round his loins and
inspired zeal for the maintenance of the law he imitated [see 23 September, 25 March, 24
June, 20 July], from the time he preached the baptism of repentance to the people by
divine command [6 January], from the time he taught both private citizens and those with
rank what they should do, and showed them the duties of their calling, from the time that
he struck those baptised by him with the fear of God, because no one can escape the wrath
to come if they do not produce worthy fruits of repentance, from the time that by such
preaching he prepared their hearts to receive the gospel teaching of the Saviour, from the
time, last of all, that he himself pointed out the Saviour and said, &#145;Behold, the
Lamb of God, who takes the sin of the world&#146; [Luke 3,2-18. John 1,29], he later
sealed with his own blood the truth of his words, become a sacred sacrificial victim on
behalf of God&#146;s law at the hands of a lawless man.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">This was Herod, the tetrarch of Galilee, the son of
Herod the Great, surnamed Antipas, who, having a lawful wife the daughter of Arethas, or
Aretas, king of Arabia, shamelessly divorced her and seized, in violation of every
commandment of the law, his brother Philip&#146;s wife Herodias, who had a daughter by him
named Salome. The preacher of repentance did not cease to denounce this rape and unlawful
union and became an outspoken and severe denouncer of the offenders. &#145;It is not
permitted you, he said to him, to have your brother&#146;s wife&#146; [Mark 6,18]. Herod
added to his other impious actions that of arresting John and shutting him up in prison.
He would have had him murdered at once had the tyrant&#146;s resolve not wavered because
of the profound reverence of the crowd for John and also his own respect for him, which he
had from the beginning entertained for this holy and just man. But in the end, goaded by
the sting of his passion for a woman, he laid foul hands on the teacher of purity on the
festive day of his birthday. When Salome had danced to his satisfaction and that of his
fellow banqueters, he made a promise to her, more senseless than all senselessness, with
an oath that, even were she to ask for half his kingdom, he would give it her as a reward
for her dance. The dancer consulted her mother and at once asked for the head of John the
Baptist on a dish. The transgressor of God&#146;s law, feigning his keeping the law with
regard to the oath, put the condition of his soul into action and filled his polluted
banquet with streams of a prophet&#146;s blood. That all-honoured head, revered also by
the Angels, he gave as a prize for a lascivious dance and it became a toy for a licentious
daughter and an adulterous mother. The godly Baptist&#146;s disciples came and took his
most sacred body and buried it in a grave [Mark 6,21-29].</font></p>

Forerunner, the Lord&#146;s testimony suffices. For you were revealed as more praiseworthy
than the Prophets, because you were found worthy to baptise in running streams the One
they had proclaimed. Therefore you struggled bravely for the truth with joy, and preached
to those in Hell a God who had appeared in flesh, who takes away the sin of the world and
grants us his great mercy.</font></p>
