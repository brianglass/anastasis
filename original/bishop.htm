<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You were revealed as in every way most sacred and a bearer of light, in the Holy Spirit
invested with divine and holy anointing, always radiantly approaching the Holy of Holies,
ablaze with the brightness that comes from God and initiated by grace into the saving
mysteries as a sacred initiator into mysteries; and as a truly far-famed Hierarch with
boldness you make intercession for our souls.</p>

<p>Your life blazed with the torches of the virtues and enlightened believers, and
dispelled the fog of error, for you truly appeared as a radiant sun, all-blessed Hierarch,
and now you have made your dwelling where the light that knows no evening shines; by the
grace of the Holy Spirit you have become a son of the day, therefore as we celebrate your
godly, light-bearing and revered memory, ever-remembered Father, with love we honour you.</p>

<p>Your mind, its inclinations towards the divine, made fair by faith and radiantly made
divine, all-revered, all-wise Father, meditated on incorruption while in a mortal and
corruptible body, and acquired the splendour of the Bodiless powers, becoming far from
passions and adorned with dispassion, O Father and wisest Hierarch, most radiant beacon
and intercessor for those who honour with faith your memorial.</font></p>

<p>Whenever the fearful tribunal of your Son comes into my mind, All-pure Virgin, and the
universal assize, I am at a loss, I am afraid, quailing and trembling at the examination
of my deeds; for all are base and full of every shame, and truly worthy of darkness and
punishment and rejection. See my distress, and see the ruin of my soul, and deliver me
from that constraint and punishment.</font></p>

<p>A sword, as Symeon said, passed through your heart, All-holy Lady, when you saw the One
who had shone from you by an ineffable word, lifted up on a Cross by lawless men as one
condemned, tasting vinegar and gall, pierced in the side, nailed by hands and feet; and
grieving you cried aloud with lamentation as a mother: My sweetest Child, what is this new
mystery?</p>

<p>Spiritually enriched with mysteries, blessed Father inspired by God, you uttered words
of doctrines; through which you became a shepherd of the Church, leading it over to a
heavenly sheepfold.</p>

<p>You sped towards the height of the ascents of Scripture, and explored its irresistible
and unravaged beauty with purity of mind, through which you have been declared a lantern
of high priesthood.</p>

<p>You encountered the divine illumination of the spiritual light, Father, and made our
minds radiant, while with rightly expounding rays you reduced heresies to ashes and burned
them up through the Spirit.</font></p>

heretics; and so a garland of victory has been woven for you.</p>

<p>You appeared as Hierarch and minister of the divine dispensation, and became an
initiator and most sacred initiate of the glory of the gifts of the Spirit.</font></p>

<p>You made the splendour of your words shine out for us, while you scattered the fog of

<p>By your entreaties to God, stretch out your hand of help to me in troubles, from the

temptations, and you sang: O Lord, highly praised, the God of our Fathers. </p>
