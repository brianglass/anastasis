straight away with:</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Three Metanias and the Psalms:</p>

<p>Psalm 5<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Give ear to my words, O Lord, understand my cry.
Attend to the voice of my supplication, my King and my God; for to you I shall pray, O
Lord. In the morning you will hear my voice. In the morning I shall stand before you, and
you will watch over me; because you are not a God who wants iniquity. The evildoer will
not dwell with you, nor will the lawless remain before your eyes. You have hated all those
who work iniquity; you will destroy all those who speak lies. The Lord abhors a man of
bloodshed and deceit. But I in the abundance of your mercy shall enter your house, I shall
worship towards your holy temple in fear of you. Guide me, Lord, in your righteousness
because of my enemies, direct my way before you. Because there is no truth in their
mouths; their heart is vain. Their throat is an open tomb, they deceive with their
tongues. Judge them, O God. Let them fall through their counsels; according to the
multitude of their impieties cast them out, for they have embittered you, O Lord. And may
all those who hope in you be glad; they will rejoice for ever, and you will dwell among
them, and all those who love your name will boast in you. Because you will bless the
righteous; you have crowned him, O Lord, with your good pleasure.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 89<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, you have been our refuge from one
generation to another. Before the mountains came into being or the earth and the world was
formed, from age to age you are. Do not turn mankind back to humiliation, and you said:
Turn back, children of men. Because a thousand years in your eyes, O Lord, are like a day,
or like yesterday which has passed, and like a watch in the night. Their years will be
mere trifles, in the morning like grass may he pass away. In the morning let him flower
and pass away; in the evening let him fall, dry up and wither. Because we have perished in
your anger, and in your wrath we have been dismayed. You have set our iniquities before
you; our age in the light of your countenance. Because all our days have perished, and in
your anger we have perished; our years they considered like a spider. The days of our
years there are seventy years in them, but if we are strong, eighty, and the majority of
them are labour and toil; because weakness has come over us and we shall be chastened. Who
knows the might of your anger? And can gauge your wrath from fear of you? So make your
right hand known to me, and those chastened in heart by wisdom. Turn back, O Lord, how
long? And be entreated for your servants. We have been filled in the morning with your
mercy, O Lord, and we have rejoiced and been glad. In all our days let be glad; in return
for the days when you humbled us, the years when we saw evils. And look upon your servants
and upon the work of your hands and guide your children. And let the brightness of the
Lord be upon us, and direct the works of our hands for us and direct the work of our hand.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 100<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">I will sing to you of mercy and judgement, O
Lord, I will chant and think on a blameless way: when will you come to me? I have walked
in the midst of my house in the innocence of my heart. I have set no lawless deed before
my eyes; I have hated those who commit transgressions. No twisted heart has been attached
to me; the evil man who avoids me I have not acknowledged. The man who secretly slanders
his neighbour, him I have driven out. With a man of proud looks and insatiate heart, I
have not eaten. My eyes are upon the faithful in the land, for them to dwell with me; the
man who walks on a blameless way, he has ministered to me. The man who acts proudly has
not dwelt in my house; the man who speaks calumnies has not prospered before me. Morning
by morning I slew all the sinners in the land, to purge from the Lord's city all workers
of iniquity.</p>

ungodly was stricken and darkened with the love of money; and to lawless judges he

[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">11:18-12:5a.9b-11a.14-15</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>Lord, make me know, and I shall know; then I saw their practices. But I, like an
innocent lamb led to be sacrificed, did not know; against me they devised an evil thought,
saying: Come, and let us cast wood into his bread and let us wipe him out of the land of
the living, and let his name be remembered no more. Lord, you judge justly, you try reins
and hearts, may I see vengeance upon them from you, because I have revealed to you my
justification. Therefore thus says the Lord to the men of Anathoth who seek for my life
and who say: Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord, otherwise you will die at our hands.
See, I shall visit them; their youths will die by the sword, their sons and daughters will
perish by hunger, and there will not be a remnant of them; because I shall bring evils
upon the inhabitants of Anathoth, in the year of their visitation. [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">12:1</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]
You are just, Lord, so I shall make my defence to you, moreover I shall speak of
judgements to you: why does the way of the ungodly go well? Those who set breaches of
faith at nothing have prospered, you planted them and they have taken root; they begot
children and produced fruit; you are near to their mouth and far from their reins. And
you, Lord, know me, you have tried my heart before you; purify them for the day of their
slaughter. How long will the land grieve and the grass of the field be dried from the
wickedness of its inhabitants? Animals and birds have vanished, because they &lt;the
inhabitants&gt; said: God will not see our ways. Your feet run and make you faint.
Assemble all the beasts of the field and let them come and eat it. Many shepherds have
destroyed my vineyard, they have defiled my portion, they have made my desired portion a
trackless desert, it has been made into utter destruction. Because thus says the Lord of
all the evil neighbours who touch my inheritance, which I have apportioned to my people
Israel: See, I shall drag them from their land and I shall cast Juda out of their midst.
And it shall be that after I have cast them out, I shall turn back and have mercy on them,
and I shall make them dwell, each in his inheritance and each in his land.</p>
