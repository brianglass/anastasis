<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Book Antiqua" size="6">CANON FOR MID-PENTECOST</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">The Acrostic is:</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The Midpoint of great feasts I sing.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 1. Tone 4. The Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Israel, who of old marched through the Red Sea dryshod, routed the power of Amalek in
the wilderness through Moses&#146; hands raised in the form of the Cross.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The great blessings of your incarnation beyond understanding shine for us, Master; your
graces without price and your divine brightness well up for us as gifts of goodness.</p>

<p>Sending out the rays of your Godhead, O Christ, you took your stand openly at the
mid-point of the feast; for you are a feast of joy for the saved and the cause of our
salvation.</p>

<p>You, Lord, have become Wisdom, Justice and Redemption for us from God, as you pass over
from earth to the height of heaven and bestow the divine Spirit.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Your flesh did not know corruption in the grave, Master; but as it had been formed
without seed, it did not undergo corruption, for supernaturally it was not enslaved to the
course of nature.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 3. The Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Your Church, O Christ, rejoices at you as she cries: you, Lord, are my strength, my
refuge and my foundation.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You opened springs of life-giving waters for the Church, O Good One, as you cried: If
any thirst, let them with fervour come and drink.</p>

<p>You said clearly that you would be lifted up from earth to heaven; but you promised to
send the Holy Spirit from heaven.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Lord, by nature giver of life and born of a Virgin, as he is compassionate has
given immortality to all the faithful.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 4. Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>When she saw you, the Sun of justice, lifted up on the Cross, the Church stood in her
rank, and fittingly cried out: Glory to your power, O Lord.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>When you broke open the gates of death by your power you made known the ways of life,
and opened the gates of immortality to those who cry in faith: Glory to your power, O
Lord.</p>

<p>You hold the mid-point of all things and their end, and as you are without beginning
you hold their beginning in your grasp. You stood in the midst and cried out: Come, all
who think godly thoughts and enjoy his gifts!</p>

<p>As God, O Christ, you have authority over all, as powerful you destroyed the might of
death, and you promised to send the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Father.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Mother who knew not wedlock, richly you pour out grace on those who hymn you and the
eternal Word who was born of you, as you ask for them forgiveness of offences, O
Immaculate.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 5. Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Lord my light, you have come into the world; a holy light turning those who hymn you
from the fog of ignorance.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Now that we have reached the mid-point of the divine feasts, let us hasten with godly
thoughts to work for the perfection of virtue inspired by God.</p>

<p>How truly sacred is the present festival, for it marks out the mid-point of the
greatest feasts and shines with light from both.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>My Saviour full of mercy, the mind of the Archangel cannot comprehend your ineffable
and immaculate birth from a Virgin.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 6. Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>I will sacrifice to you, Lord, with a voice of praise, your Church cries out to you,
purified from the filth of demons by the blood which flows through pity from your side.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The mid-point of Pentecost is here to-day, brilliant from the one side in the
brightness of the divine Pascha, and shining from the other with grace of the Comforter.</p>

<p>As you stood in the Temple, O Christ, you spoke with the Jewish people, revealing your
own glory, and showing forth your identity of nature with the Father.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Be my protection and an unshakeable wall, delivering me from the world&#146;s stumbling
blocks, only Mother of God, and making me shine with the light that floods from God.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 7. The Irmos,</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Children of Abraham in the Persian furnace, ablaze not with the flame but with love
for true religion, cried aloud: Blessed are you, Lord, in the temple of your glory.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Saviour, by strength you destroyed the power of death and made known the path of life
to mortals, who cry aloud: Blessed are you, Lord, in the temple of your glory.</p>

<p>When they saw you bearing flesh the Hebrew people did not acknowledge you, O Word of
God; but we sing to you: Blessed are you, Lord, in the temple of your glory.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Hallowed, divine dwelling of the Most High, hail! For through you, Mother of God, joy
has been given to those who cry aloud: Blessed are you among women, all-spotless Lady.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 8. The Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Daniel, stretching out his hands, shut up the mouths of lions in the den, while the
Youths, lovers of piety and clothed in virtue, quenched the power of fire, as they cried:
All you works of the Lord, bless the Lord!</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>In beauty you rose from the tomb, Lord, adorned in the glory of your Godhead, and
appeared to your Apostles, promising to send the force of the Spirit to them as they
cried: All you works, praise the Lord!</p>

<p>Having slain Hell as God, supreme source of life, you became for all a source of
eternal life, which the graces of these brilliant days now most clearly resemble for those
who cry: All you works, praise the Lord!</p>

<p>Showing your rays, O Christ, as sun of justice, you sent out your Apostles to the
world, bearing you, the light ineffable, dispelling the fog of ignorance and crying: All
you works, praise the Lord!</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>See now a ruler, a leader has now clearly failed from the tribe of Juda; for you,
all-spotless one, have given birth to the things stored up for him, the expectation of the
nations, Christ, to whom we sing: All you works of the Lord, bless the Lord!</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 9. The Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>A stone, the head of the corner, cut without hands, Christ was cut from you, O Virgin,
mountain unhewn, uniting the separated natures: therefore rejoicing, Mother of God, we
magnify you.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>From Christ we have learnt a new and fresh way of life: let us all strive diligently to
keep it to the end, that we may enjoy the coming of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Giver of Life, you have clothed my mortality with the cloak of immortality and the
grace of incorruption; you have raised it with yourself and brought it to the Father,
ending my age-long war.</p>

<p>Invited once again to the heavenly way of life by the power of the mediation of him who
emptied himself even to taking the form of a slave, and raised us up, let us fittingly
magnify him.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>All we faithful, trusting in you, O Virgin, honour you with words of praise, as root
and source and cause of incorruption: for you made the empersonned immortality blossom for
us.</font>
