<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Book Antiqua" size="5">INTRODUCTION</p>
</font>

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">This translation of the office of Matins for Sundays
and Feasts contains the complete text of the common of the office, with the exception of
the <i>Kathismata</i> of the Psalter and the verses of the Biblical Canticles, since these
are rarely used except in monasteries. In an Appendix we give the text of the first two
psalms of the <i>Polyeleos</i>, but not the selection of verses for the various major
feasts, together with Psalms 44 and 136, which may also form part of the <i>Polyeleos</i>
on certain days. The farcings of Psalm 44 are taken from the invaluable <i>Sylleitourgikon</i>,
or &#145;Reader&#146;s Handbook&#146;, published by the Holy Monastery of Simonos Petra in
1996. The full text of the short litanies that follow the readings from the Psalter and
the 3rd and 6th Odes of the <i>Canon</i> are omitted, since these are seldom used in
parishes. We do however, for completeness, give the text of the final <i>Ekphonesis</i> of
each<i>. </i>The eleven Resurrection <i>Exapostilaria </i>and the corresponding <i>Eothina</i>
have also been included. For the convenience of singers and readers they are given in
separate sections.</p>

<p>The underlying <i>Typikon</i> is that of the Holy Mountain, to which the Russian <i>Typikon
</i>corresponds for the most part very closely. In Greek parishes on Sundays the reading
of the Gospel is normally displaced to the end of the <i>Katavasia</i> of the 8th Ode,
immediately before the Magnificat<i>.</i> In this case the order for the Gospel begins
with the deacon&#146;s &#145;Let us pray to the Lord&#146;, on page 23. The Cypriot <i>Typikon</i>,
however, preserves the traditional order. Interestingly in the old &#145;Cathedral
Office&#146;, as described by St Symeon of Thessaloniki, the Gospel was sung as the climax
of Sunday Matins, after the <i>Eothinon. </i>St Symeon regrets the increasing popularity
of the monastic practice, but it eventually prevailed. In Greek parish use Matins normally
precedes the Liturgy, which begins immediately after the <i>Troparion</i> &#145;Today
salvation has come to the world&#146;, used for all eight Tones, the concluding litanies
and dismissal being said quietly in the sanctuary by the priest and deacon.</p>

<p>The rubric that the priest should come out to read the Matins prayers during the Six
Psalms at the beginning of the 5th Psalm rather than the 4th is, in fact, what the <i>Typikon
</i>of St Savvas directs, and it is still the practice of some monasteries. In the old
order, presupposed by the <i>Typikon</i> of St Savvas, the Six Psalms were chanted
solemnly and there was therefore time to read all Twelve Prayers during the last two
Psalms. The Six Psalms should be read by <b>one </b>reader, not divided between several.
They are one of the <i>gerontika</i>, that is the parts normally read by the Superior, and
should be allocated to a senior person, such a visiting priest. All should remain standing
during the Six Psalms. They are not an opportunity, for Singers in particular, to practice
that well-known Orthodox rubric, &#145;Here beginneth the animated discussion&#146;.</p>

<p>When Matins forms part of a Vigil it follows the <i>Artoklasia</i> at the end of
Vespers. The Midnight Office is omitted, though some monasteries read the Canon to the
Trinity at a Vigil on a Sunday. In normal monastic use the blessing by the priest that
concludes the <i>Artoklasia</i> is followed by a patristic reading. After the reader has
announced the title, the priest gives the usual blessing, &#145;Blessed is our
God&#133;&#146;, and the reader begins. At the end of the reading the Six Psalms begin at
once, with &#145;Glory to God in the highest&#133;&#146;. The <i>Royal Office</i> is
omitted entirely. If there is no reading, the Six Psalms follow the blessing by the
priest, &#145;The blessing of the Lord be upon you&#133;,&#146; which ends the <i>Artoklasia</i>.
The First Hour is read at the end of Matins, unless the Liturgy follows at once, and we
have therefore included it here.</p>

<p>In most parishes the Royal Office is abbreviated, and, the censing and the two Psalms
being omitted, the Reader begins at once with the <i>Trisagion.</i></p>

<p>When Matins is celebrated in full it is not normal for the deacon to vest until the <i>Anavathmi</i>,
the priest saying all the preceding litanies himself. In Greek parish use, the clergy vest
and perform the Proskomidi<i> </i>during the first part of Matins, after the Litany of
Peace. In monasteries the celebrating clergy take the <i>kairos</i> during the reading of
the Psalter and then return to their stalls until it is time for them to vest for the
Liturgy. In parishes the <i>kairos </i>is taken after the Six Psalms and Litany of Peace,
or even before the beginning of the service.</p>

<p>The prayer after Psalm 50 is the text, apart from the addition of <i>Mothers</i> among
the ascetics, as it appears in the earliest sources. It is now customary to expand it with
a great many additional names in accordance with local custom.</p>

<p>Most of the technical terms, including those printed in italic in this preface, are
explained in a short Glossary at the end.</p>

<p>Since Matins is a longer and more complex service than Vespers and the ways of
celebrating it vary more widely, it is not feasible to provide for every possible use.</p>

<p>After the Dismissal of the Midnight Office the Priest, having made the customary
metania to the Superior, or to his stall, enters the sanctuary and makes three bows before
the holy Table. He puts on the Epitrachelion and, standing in front of the Holy Table,
intones:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>The Priest blesses the incense and begins to cense the sanctuary and the whole church
as usual.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reader begins the following Psalms:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Come, let us worship and fall down before the King our God.</p>

<p>Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ the King our God.</p>

<p>Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King, our God.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Psalm 19</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may the
name of the God of Jacob shield you. May he send you his help from the holy place, and
support you from Sion. May he remember your every sacrifice, and accept with favour your
whole burnt offering. May the Lord give you your heart&#146;s desire, and fulfil your
every purpose. We shall rejoice in your salvation, and be magnified in the name of our the
Lord our God. May the Lord fulfil all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved
his Christ. He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty acts is the salvation of his
right hand. Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will call on the
name of the Lord our God. They were fettered and fell, but we have risen and been set
upright. Lord, save the king, and hear us on the day we call upon you.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Psalm 20</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The king will rejoice in your power, O Lord, he will
exult exceedingly in your salvation. You gave him his heart&#146;s desire; you did not
deny him the request of his lips. For you came to meet him with blessings of goodness; you
placed a crown of precious stones upon his head. He asked you for life, and you gave him
length of days for age on age. Great is his glory because of your salvation; you will
place on him glory and majesty. For you will give him blessing for age on age, and make
him glad with the joy of your countenance. For the king puts his hope in the Lord, and
through the mercy of the Most High he will not be shaken. May your hand light upon all
your enemies, and your right hand find out all who hate you. You will make them like a
blazing oven at the time of your presence. The Lord will confound them in his wrath and
fire will devour them. You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their seed
from among the children of humankind. Because they intended evils against you, and devised
plans by which they can in no way succeed. For you will put them to flight; among your
remnants you will prepare their presence. Be exalted, Lord, in your power; we will sing
and praise your mighty acts.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and
to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p>Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> (three times)</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and
to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p>All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our
iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your name's sake. Lord, have
mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.</p>

<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and
to the ages of ages. Amen</p>

<p>Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed; your kingdom come; your will be done
on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we
forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>The priest must take care that he is standing beneath the Polyeleos to say this
conclusion. He then enters the sanctuary, puts away the censer and takes his stand in
front of the Holy Table.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reader says the following Troparia:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Lord, save your people, and bless your inheritance, granting to faithful Christians
victory over their enemies, and guarding your commonwealth by your Cross.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.</p>

<p>Lifted up on the Cross of your own will, to the new commonwealth that bears your name
grant your mercies, Christ God; make your faithful people glad by your power, granting
them victories over their enemies; may they have your help in battle: a weapon of peace,
an invincible trophy.</p>

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">And we begin the Six Psalms,
listening with complete silence and compunction. The Superior, or the designated reader,
with devotion and fear of God says:</font></p>

<p>Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth, goodwill among men.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> (x3)</font></p>

<p>Psalm 3</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, why have those who afflict me been multiplied?
Many rise against me. Many say to my soul, &#145;There is no salvation for him in his
God&#146;. But you, Lord, are my helper, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. With
my voice, I cried to the Lord, and he heard me from his holy mountain. I lay down and
slept; I awoke, because the Lord will assist me. I will not be afraid of tens of thousands
of people who surround me. Rise, Lord, save me, my God; because you have struck all who
are vainly my foes. You have smashed the teeth of sinners. Salvation is the Lord's, and
your blessing is upon your people.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 37</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chastise me
in your wrath. For your arrows have been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a heavy hand
upon me. There is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in my bones
on account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my head; like a heavy burden they
weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank and festered on account of my foolishness. I was
wretched and utterly bowed down; I went about mourning all day long. For my loins were
filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated
exceedingly; I howled from the groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you,
and my groaning was not hidden from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and
even the light of my eyes had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and
stood against me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life used
force, and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and meditated trickeries all day
long. But I, like a deaf man, heard nothing; like one who is dumb, who does not open his
mouth. So I became like one who cannot hear, and in whose mouth there are no rebukes. For
in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will answer me, O Lord my God. For I said: Let my foes
never exult over me. When my foot slipped they crowed over me. For I am ready for blows
and my pain is with me continually. For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my
sin. But my enemies live and have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly have
been multiplied. Those who repay me with evils in place of good have slandered me, since I
pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not go far from me. Hasten to help
me, Lord of my salvation.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 62</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">O God, my God, I watch for you at dawn; my soul has
thirsted for you, my flesh how often in a desert, untrodden and waterless land. Thus I
appeared before you in the holy place, to see your power and your glory. For your mercy is
better than life; my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live, and in
your name I will lift up my hands. May my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; my
mouth will praise you with joyful lips. When I remembered you upon my bed, every dawn I
meditated upon you. For you became my helper, and in the shelter of your wings I shall
rejoice. My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld me. But those who vainly sought
my life will go down to the deepest parts of the earth, they will be delivered to the
power of the sword, they will be portions for foxes. But the king will rejoice in God, and
all who swear by him will be praised; for the mouths of those who speak iniquities have

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day, and by
night also before you. Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to my
supplication. For my soul was filled with evils, and my life drew near to Hell. I was
reckoned among those that go down to the Pit; I became as one that has no help, free among
the dead. Like the slain that sleep in the tomb, whom you remembered no more; and they
were cut off from your power. They placed me in the lowest Pit; in darkness and in the
shadow of death. Your wrath lay heavy upon me, and you brought all your waves against me.
You put my friends far from me, and made me an abomination to them. I was handed over and
I came out; my eyes grew weak because of my beggary. I cried to you, Lord, all the day; I
stretched out my hands towards you. Will you work wonders for the dead; or will physicians
raise them up again to praise you? Will any declare your mercy in the tomb, or your truth
in the place of destruction? Will your wonders be known in the dark, or your justice in a
land that has been forgotten? But to you, Lord, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer
will come before you. Why have you rejected my soul, Lord; why do you turn away your face
from me? I am poor and in toils since my youth; exalted, I was humbled and brought to
despair. Your fierce anger overwhelmed me, and your terrors appalled me. They surrounded
me like water all day long; they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour
you have put far from me, and my companions because of my misery.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 102</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me,
bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of his benefits. He
forgives all your iniquities; he heals all your diseases; he redeems your life from
corruption and crowns you with mercy and compassion; he satisfies your desire with good
things; your youth will be renewed like an eagle's. The Lord performs deeds of mercy and
judgement for all who are oppressed. He made known his ways to Moses, his wishes to the
children of Israel. The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of
mercy. He will not always be wrathful, nor will he be enraged for ever. He has not dealt
with us according to our iniquities, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For, like the
height of heaven above the earth, the Lord has made his mercy prevail over those that fear
him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he taken our sins from us. As a
father takes pity on his children the Lord has taken pity on those who fear him. For he
knows of what we are made; has remembered that we are but dust. As for man, his days are
but as grass, he will blossom like a flower of the field; for when a wind has passed over
it, it will be no more and will know its place no longer. But the mercy of the Lord is for
ever and ever upon those who fear him; and his justice upon their children's children,
upon those who keep his covenant and remember his commandments to do them. The Lord has
prepared his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Bless the Lord, all you his
Angels, powerful in strength, who perform his word, and listen to the voice of his words.
Bless the Lord, all you his Powers, his Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord, all you
his works. In every place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul!</font></p>

for in your sight no one living can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul; humbled
my life to the ground; made me dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit in
me grew weary, and my heart was troubled within me. I remembered days of old; I meditated
on all your works. I made the works of your hands my meditation. I stretched out my hands
towards you; my soul thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord; my
spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to
the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to
me the way in which I should walk, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my
enemies, Lord; I have run to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my
God. Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land. For your name's sake, O Lord, you

his stand in the middle of the church. In Athonite use, he stands directly beneath the
polyeleos for the Superior to venerate the Gospel. He then moves further to the west for
the rest of those present to do so. The server with the candle is the last to venerate. In
most Greek parishes the Gospel is then taken to back of the church, preceded by the
candle, and placed on a stand near the west end of the church, so that latecomers may
venerate it. There follows the veneration of the Gospel, after which the Priest returns to
the Sanctuary and places the Gospel on the Holy Table, or, where it is the custom, at the
back of the Church.</p>

<p>On all other days the Psalm is read and there is no veneration of the Gospel.</p>

<p>Turn away your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.</p>

<p>Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me.</p>

<p>Do not cast me out from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me.</p>

the morning you will hear my voice. In the morning I shall stand before you, and you will
watch over me; because you are not a God who wants iniquity. The evil-doer will not dwell
with you, nor will the lawless remain before your eyes. You have hated all those who work
iniquity; you will destroy all those who speak lies. The Lord abhors a man of bloodshed
and deceit. But I, in the abundance of your mercy, will enter your house, I will worship
towards your holy temple in fear of you. Guide me, Lord, in your justice because of my
enemies, direct my way before you. Because there is no truth in their mouths; their heart
is vain. Their throat is an open tomb, they deceive with their tongues. Judge them, O God.
Let them fall through their counsels; according to the multitude of their impieties cast
them out, for they have embittered you, O Lord. And may all those who hope in you be glad;
they will rejoice for ever, and you will dwell among them, and all those who love your

<p>Psalm 89</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, you have been our refuge from one generation to

age to age you are. Do not turn humankind back to humiliation, and you said: Turn back,
children of men. Because a thousand years in your eyes, Lord, are like a day, or like
yesterday which has passed, and like a watch in the night. Their years will be mere
trifles, in the morning like grass may he pass away. In the morning let him flower and
pass away; in the evening let him fall, dry up and wither. Because we have perished in
your anger, and in your wrath we have been dismayed. You have set our iniquities before
you; our age in the light of your countenance. Because all our days have perished, and in
your anger we have perished; our years were reckoned like a spider. The days of our years
there are seventy years in them, but if we are strong, eighty, and the majority of them
are labour and toil; because weakness has come over us and we shall be chastened. Who
knows the might of your anger? And can gauge your wrath from fear of you? So make your
right hand known to me, and those chastened in heart by wisdom. Turn back, O Lord, how
long? And be entreated for your servants. We have been filled in the morning with your
mercy, O Lord, and we have rejoiced and been glad. In all our days let us be glad; in
return for the days when you humbled us, the years when we saw evils. And look upon your
servants and upon the work of your hands and guide your children. And let the brightness
of the Lord be upon us, and direct the works of our hands for us, and direct the work of

midst of my house in the innocence of my heart. I have set no lawless deed before my eyes;
I have hated those who commit transgressions. No twisted heart has been attached to me;
the evil man who avoids me I have not acknowledged. The man who secretly slanders his
neighbour, him I have driven out. With a man of proud looks and insatiate heart I have not
eaten. My eyes are upon the faithful in the land, for them to dwell with me; the man who
walks on a blameless way, he has ministered to me. The man who acts proudly has not dwelt
in my house; the man who speaks calumnies has not prospered before me. Morning by morning

Antiphons, except for Tone Eight, which has four. They are sung immediately before the <i>Prokeimenon.
</i>On Feasts the first Antiphon of Tone Four is always used, and hence the <i>Prokeimenon</i>

<p>Doxology.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> An ancient hymn of praise, common
to both East and West. In the East it has two forms, the Greater and Lesser. The former is
used at Matins on Sundays and Feasts, the latter at Matins on ordinary days and at
Compline. Like the Latin <i>Te Deum,</i> the hymn itself is followed by a series of verses
from the Psalter. The Great Doxology ends with the solemn singing of the Trisagion. The
Lesser Doxology ends with the prayer <i>Grant Lord this day</i>, which, at both Vespers
and non-festal Matins, precedes the Bowing of Heads. The word &#145;doxology&#146; is also
used for other short ascriptions of praise to the Holy Trinity. See <i>Doxastikon </i>and <i>Ekphonesis.</i></font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Doxastikon.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> A hymn sung after the short
doxology &#145;Glory (Greek <i>doxa</i>) to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy
Spirit&#146;<i>.</i> It is normally sung to a slower and more elaborate melody than the
preceding hymns.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Ekphonesis</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i>.</i> Used chiefly of the final
doxology that ends every prayer. It is usually, but not always, sung out loud (Greek <i>ekphônô</i>),
even when the prayer itself is directed to be read &#145;in a low voice&#146; (Greek <i>mystikôs</i>).</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Eothina. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Meaning &#145;of the dawn&#146;. The

each Sunday at Matins, and [b] to the eleven <i>idiomels</i> by the Emperor Leo the Wise
[866-912], that are sung at the end of Lauds on Sunday. There is one to correspond each of
the eleven Gospels, of which they are poetic summaries. In the old &#145;Sung&#146;, or
&#145;Cathedral&#146;, office, as described by St Symeon of Thessaloniki [&#134; 1429],
they were sung immediately before the Resurrection Gospel.</font></p>

<p>Epitrachelion.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Worn round the neck, which is

difference being that it is always joined down the middle, normally with a series of
ornamental studs. It is also broader then the stole<i>. </i>It is the characteristic
priestly vestment, worn only by bishops and priests. A priest should not celebrate any
service unless he is wearing it.</font></p>

<p>Evlogitaria. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">A series of short hymns
introduced with the refrain &#145;Blessed (Greek <i>evlogitos</i>) are you, O Lord, teach
me your statutes&#146;, which are sung at the end of Psalm 118, or the <i>Polyeleos</i>,
at Matins on Sundays. There is another set which is sung on Saturdays of the Departed, and
also at Funerals and Memorial Services.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Exapostilarion.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Short hymns sung at the end
of the Canon at Matins. For Sundays there are eleven, written by the son of Leo the Wise,

<p>Gerontika. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">A convenient word used to indicate
those parts of the office which are traditionally read by the Superior, or Elder (Greek <i>Gerôn</i>,
or <i>Geronta</i>)<i>. </i>If the Superior is absent they are read by the senior monk
present. A visiting priest or important visitor is often asked to read them. At festal
Matins they include the Six Psalms, Psalm 50 and the concluding Prayer of the First Hour.</font></p>

<p>Ikos.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>See </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Kontakion</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i>.</i></font></p>

<p>Irmos.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> The verse which gives the tune to

feasts the Irmi are sung twice and may also be used as <i>Katavasias.</i></font></p>

language a <i>skoupho, </i>or &#145;bonnet&#146;. The familiar &#145;stove pot&#146; hat
of Orthodox bishops, priests and deacons. In Greek use those of the secular clergy have a
brim on top. Monks, whether priests or not, wear a cowl (Greek <i>koukoulli</i>, from
Latin <i>cucullus</i>) over their <i>skoupho. </i>When worn by secular Archimandrites and
Bishops it is called an <i>Epanokalymafchion</i> or &#145;over kalymafchion&#146;. The
Russian cowl is permanently attached to the <i>skoupho</i>, and the whole is called a <i>klobuk</i>,
but the Greek cowl can be removed separately, and the rules for when to wear what are
quite complicated.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Katavasia.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> The final verse of an Ode of a
Canon, so called because the Singers used to come down (Greek <i>katavainein</i>) from
their stalls and unite in the middle of the Choir to sing them. On Sundays and major
Feasts there is one after every Ode. They are often &#145;seasonal&#146;, and anticipate
the next great Feast. Thus the <i>Katavasias </i>of Christmas are sung from the 21st of
November onwards. The &#145;normal&#146; <i>Katavasias</i> are those of the Canon to the
Mother of God in Tone 4, &#145;I will open my mouth&#146;. On non-festal days they occur

(Greek <i>Staseis</i>)<i>.</i></font></p>

<p>Kontakion.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Originally a &#145;verse
sermon&#146; consisting of a <i>Proemium</i> followed by a series of longer stanzas, or <i>Ikoi</i>,
all ending with the same phrase, like a refrain. They were gradually displaced by the <i>Canons</i>,
and in the present office only the <i>Proemuim</i>, now called the <i>Kontakion</i>, and
the first <i>Ikos</i> survive. In current Greek use they are normally read at Matins,
except on great Feasts, and the final phrase is repeated, a survival of the ancient
practice. In Russian use the <i>Kontakion</i> is normally sung at Matins on Sundays. The <i>Kontakion
</i>is also read at the Hours and sung at the Liturgy, though in Greek use those at the
Liturgy are &#145;seasonal&#146;, like the <i>Katavasias. </i>The greatest writer of <i>Kontakia</i>
is St Romanos [6th century], many of whose <i>Kontakia </i>are still in use.</font></p>

&#145;monthly&#146;. The book containing the services for days of the month. There are
thus twelve volumes of <i>Menaia</i>. For places without a full set of <i>Menaia</i> there
exists in both Greek and Slavonic a volume containing general offices for each category of
Saint called the <i>General Menaion.</i> The contents of the Greek and Slavonic <i>General
Menaia</i> are not quite the same, the Slavonic containing more offices, as well as texts
for a full Vigil for each category of Saint, and also for the Lord and the Mother of God.</font></p>

Western chasuble. The rubrics direct that the priest is to &#145;lower the
phelonion&#146;, that is to let it fall over his hands, at the moment of the Dismissal.
This indicates that the work of the service is over, rather like rolling down one&#146;s
sleeves. Russian <i>phelonia</i> often have a row of buttons across the chest so that the
front of the vestment can be raised or lowered.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Polyeleos.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Psalms 134 and 135 which are sung
as the third Kathisma of the Psalter on major Feasts. They are so called because of the
many (<i>poly</i>) repetitions of the word &#145;mercy&#146; (<i>eleos</i>) in Psalm 135.
The third section consists of selected psalm verses for each major feast. In Russian use
these are usually to reduced to one or two, accompanied by a <i>Megalynarion. </i>The word

beneath the central dome of the choir. It symbolizes Christ, the &#145;most
merciful&#146;. When furnished with oil lamps it also uses &#145;much oil&#146; (Greek <i>poly
elaion</i>). On the Holy Mountain the <i>Polyeleos</i> is lighted and swung, to
spectacular effect, at &#145;Lord, I have cried&#146; and during the <i>Polyeleos</i> at
great Vigils. It is also lighted at the Great Entrance on major Feasts, and also at
funerals. Around the <i>polyeleos</i> there<i> </i>often hangs a great metal circle,
decorated with icons, normally including the twelve Apostles, and surmounted by candles.
This is known as a <i>choros.</i></font></p>

Sundays and feasts. At the <i>Aposticha</i> one sticheron is sung before the first psalm
verse. The Aposticha at Vespers on Sundays form an alphabetical acrostic, three letters
each week, but the first sticheron in each Tone does not form part of the series.</font></p>

<p>Theotokion.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Most series of hymns end with one

second part of the short doxology, &#145;Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
Amen&#146;<i>, </i>and is normally sung in the same Tone as the preceding <i>Doxastikon.</i>
On Saturday evening, however, the <i>Theotokion</i> at the Entrance is nearly always that
of the Tone of the week, regardless of the Tone of the <i>Doxastikon</i>. It is also sung
again at Vespers on the following Friday. In Russian usage this <i>Theotokion </i>is
called the <i>Dogmatic</i>, whereas in Greek the latter name is used for the corresponding
