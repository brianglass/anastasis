<p>Psalm 5</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Give ear to my words, O Lord, understand my cry. Attend
to the voice of my supplication, my King and my God, for to you I shall pray, O Lord. In
the morning you will hear my voice. In the morning I shall stand before you, and you will
watch over me, because you are not a God who wants iniquity. The evildoer will not dwell
with you, nor will the lawless remain before your eyes. You have hated all those who work
iniquity; you will destroy all those who speak lies. The Lord abhors a man of bloodshed
and deceit. But I in the abundance of your mercy shall enter your house, I shall worship
towards your holy temple in fear of you. Guide me, O Lord, in your justice because of my
enemies, direct my way before you. Because there is no truth in their mouths; their heart
is vain. Their throat is an open tomb, they deceive with their tongues. Judge them, O God.
Let them fall through their counsels; according to the multitude of their impieties cast
them out, for they have embittered you, O Lord. And may all those who hope in you be glad;
they will rejoice for ever, and you will dwell among them, and all those who love your
name will boast in you. Because you will bless the righteous; you have crowned him, O
Lord, with your good pleasure.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 44</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">My heart has uttered a good Word. I tell my works to
the King. My tongue is the pen of ready writer. You are lovely with a beauty beyond the
children of men. Grace has poured from your lips, therefore God has blessed you for ever.
Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty warrior. In your splendour and beauty, draw your
bow and prosper and reign in the cause of truth and meekness and justice, and your right
hand will guide you wonderfully. Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the sceptre of
your Kingdom is a rod of justice. You have loved right and hated wrong, therefore God your
God has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your fellows. Your garments are
fragrant with myrrh, aloes and cassia, from the ivory palaces which gladden you.
Kings&#146; daughters are in your train. The Queen stood at your right hand arrayed in
gold wrought with many colours. Listen my daughter and see, and incline your ear. And
forget your people and your father&#146;s house. Then the King will desire your beauty,
for he is your God and your shall worship him. And the daughter of Tyre will worship you
with gifts. The richest of the people will entreat your favour. All the glory of the
King&#146;s daughter is within, though she is arrayed in tasselled gold, wrought with many
colours. The virgins in her train will be brought to the King, those near her will be
brought to you. They will be brought with joy and gladness, they will be led into the
King&#146;s temple. Instead of your fathers, sons are born to you. You shall make them
rulers over all the earth. I will remember your name throughout all generations, therefore
people will praise and thank you for ever and ever. </font></p>

<p>Psalm 45</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">God is our refuge and our power, a help in the
afflictions that beset us greatly. Therefore we shall not be afraid when the earth is
troubled, and mountains are removed into the heart of the sea. Their waters roared and
were troubled, the mountains were troubled by his might. The surgings of the river delight
the City of God; the Most High has sanctified his tabernacle. God is in the midst of her,
and she will not be shaken; God will help her towards the morning. Nations were troubled,
kingdoms tottered, he uttered his voice, the earth was shaken. The Lord of powers is with
us, our helper is the God of Jacob. Come and see the works of God, the wonders he has done
upon the earth, putting an end to wars as far as the ends of the earth. He will smash the
bow and shatter the weapon, and burn the shields with fire. Be still, and know that I am
God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. The God of
powers is with us, our helper is the God of Jacob.</font></p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: And you Bethlehem, house of Ephratha, are not least among the

Israel, and his goings out are from the beginning, from eternity. Because of this he will
give them until the moment that she who bears child shall bring to birth; and the
remainder of his brethren will return to the children of Israel. And he will stand and

[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">1:1-12</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>In many and varied ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets; but in these
last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through
whom also he created the ages. He is the radiance of his glory and the very imprint of his
substance, upholding the universe by the word of his power. When he had made purification
for our sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as much
superior to angels as the name he has obtained is more excellent than theirs. For to which
of the angels did God ever say, &#145;You are my Son, today I have begotten you&#146;? Or
again, &#145;I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son&#146;? And again, when
he brings the first-born into the world, he says, &#145;Let all God&#146;s angels worship
him.&#146; Of the angels he says, &#145;Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers
flames of fire.&#146; But to the Son he says, &#145;Your throne, O God, is to age on age,
the sceptre of justice is the sceptre of your kingdom. You have loved justice and hated
iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your
comrades.&#146; And, &#145;You, Lord, founded the earth in the beginning, and the heavens
are the work of your hands; they will perish, but you remain; they will all grow old like
a garment, like a mantle you will roll them up, and they will be changed. But you are the
same, and your years will never end.&#146;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the holy Gospel according to Matthew.<br>
[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">1:18-25</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been
betrothed to Joseph, but before they had come together, she was found to be with child
from the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to expose her to
public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. But just when he had resolved to do this,
an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, &#145;Joseph, son of David, do
not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the
Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his
people from their sins.&#146; All this took place to fulfil what had been spoken by the
Lord through the prophet: &#145;See, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they
shall call his name Emmanuel,&#146; which means, &#145;God is with us.&#146; When Joseph
awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife,
but he did not know her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus.</font></p>

Against you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight: that you may be
justified in your words, and win when you are judged. For see, in wickedness I was
conceived: and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have loved truth: you have shown me
wisdom&#146;s hidden and secret things. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be
cleansed: You will wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy
and gladness: the bones which have been humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my
sins: and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God: and renew a right
Spirit within me. Do not cast me out of your presence: do not take your Holy Spirit from
me. O give me back the joy of your salvation: and establish me with a sovereign Spirit.
Then I shall teach transgressors your ways: and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the
God of my salvation, deliver me from bloodshed: and my tongue will rejoice at your
righteousness. O Lord, you will open my lips: and my mouth will declare your praise. For
if you had wanted sacrifice, I would have given it: burnt offerings do not please you. A
sacrifice for God is a broken spirit: a broken and a humbled heart, O God, you will not

you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek,

<p>In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be
enrolled. This was the first enrolment and was taken while Quirinius was governor of
Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of
Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was from
the house and family of David. He went to be enrolled with Mary, his espoused wife who was
with child. While they were there, the time came for her to be delivered. And she gave
birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger,
because there was no place for them in the inn. In that region there were shepherds
abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord
stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were sore afraid.
But the angel said to them, &#145;Fear not; for see &#151; I am bringing you good tidings
of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
who is Christ, the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in
swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.&#146; And suddenly there was with the angel a
multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, &#145;Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace, among men good will!&#146; When the angels had left them and
gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &#145;Let us go now to Bethlehem and
see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.&#146; So they
went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they
saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it
were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and
pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all
they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.</font></p>

mine which I shall teach them, Their sons too will sit on your throne for ever. For the
Lord has elected Sion, has chosen her as a dwelling for himself: This is my dwelling-place

<p>Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, &#145;Ask a sign of the Lord your God; in the depth or in
the height.&#146; But Ahaz said, &#145;I will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the
test.&#146; And he [Isaias] said, &#145;Hear then, O house of David! Is it a little thing
for you to contend with men, and how do you contend with the Lord? Therefore the Lord
himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they
shall call his name Emmanuel. He shall eat butter and honey before he knows how to prefer
evil or choose good. For before the child knows good or evil, he refuses the evil to
choose the good. Then the Lord said to me, 'Take for yourself a large new volume and write
upon it in with a man&#146;s pen, Of making a rapid plunder of spoils; for it is at hand.
And get me witnesses, reliable men, Urias the priest and Zachary the son of Barachias. And
I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the Lord said to me,
'Call his name Despoil-quickly-plunder-rapidly; for before the child knows how to cry
&#145;Father&#146; or &#145;Mother,&#146; he will take the power of Damascus and the spoil
of Samaria before the king of the Assyrians.' Know you nations and be worsted; give ear,
as far as the extremity of the earth; for if again you have become strong, again you will
be worsted. And whatever counsel you take, the Lord will scatter it; and whatever word you
speak, it will not remain in you, for God is with us.&#146;</p>

<p>&#145;You, Lord, founded the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of
your hands; they will perish, but you remain; they will all grow old like a garment, like
a mantle you will roll them up, and they will be changed. But you are the same, and your
years will never end.&#146; But to what angel has he ever said, &#145;Sit at my right
hand, till I make your enemies a footstool for your feet&#146;? Are they not all
ministering spirits sent forth to serve, for the sake of those who are to inherit
salvation? Therefore we must pay the closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift
away from it. For if the word spoken by angels was sure and every transgression or
disobedience received a just retribution, how shall we escape if we neglect such a great
salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who
heard him.</p>

<p>When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the King, Magi from the
East came to Jerusalem, asking, &#145;Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For
we seen his star at its rising, and have come to worship him.&#146; When King Herod heard
this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; and calling together all the chief
priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
They told him, &#145;In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet:
&#145;And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, are by no means least among the rulers of
Juda; for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel.&#146;&#146;
Then Herod secretly called for the Magi and learned from them the exact time when the star
had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, &#145;Go and search diligently for
the child; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and worship
him.&#146; When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the
star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child
was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering
the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and worshipped
him. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense,
and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their
own country by another road.</font></p>

unripe age of their babes was bitterly harvested. Breasts grew dry and the channels of
milk were stopped. Great was the calamity! And so let us, the faithful, devoutly assembled
worship Christ&#146;s Nativity.<br>

<p>When Joseph had been wounded by sorrow, O Virgin, as he went to Bethlehem you cried out
to him, &#145;Why are you downcast and troubled seeing me great with child? Why wholly
ignorant of the dread mystery that is in me. Now cast away every fear as you understand
the strange marvel: for in my womb now God descends to earth through mercy, and has taken
flesh. You will see when he is born, as he has been well pleased; and filled with joy will
worship him as your Creator. Him the Angels praise unceasingly with the Father and the
Holy Spirit.&#146;</font></p>

<p>A child has been born for us, a son has been given to us; whose government is upon his
shoulder, and his name will be called &#145;Angel of Great Counsel, Wonderful Counsellor,
Mighty God, Potentate, Prince of Peace, Father of the age to come.&#146; For I will bring
peace upon princes, peace and health to him. Great his government, and of his peace there
is no bound, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to
uphold it with judgement and with justice from henceforth and for evermore. The zeal of
the Lord of hosts will do this.</p>

[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">2:11-18</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>Brethren, the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from One. For
this reason he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying: I will proclaim your name to
my brethren, in the midst of the church I will praise you. And again: I will put my trust
in him. And again: Here am I, and children whom God has given me. Since, therefore, the
children share flesh and blood, he himself likewise shared the same things, so that
through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is the devil, and
free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. For it is clear
he did not take on himself the nature of Angels, but he took on that of the descendants of
Abraham. Therefore he had to become like his brethren in every respect, so that he might
be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make atonement for the
sins of the people. For because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to
help those who are being tested.</p>

<p>Now when the Magi had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a
dream and said, &#145;Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain
there till I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.&#146;
And he rose and took the child and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt, and
remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfil what the Lord had spoken by
the prophet, &#145;Out of Egypt have I called my son.&#146; Then Herod, when he saw that
he had been tricked by the Magi, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the
male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under,
according to the time which he had ascertained from the Magi. Then was fulfilled what was
spoken by the prophet Jeremias, &#145;A voice was heard in Rama, wailing and loud
lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they
were no more.&#146; But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream
to Joseph in Egypt, saying, &#145;Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land
of Israel, for those who sought the child&#146;s life are dead.&#146; And he rose and took
the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus
reigned over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being
warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee. And he went and dwelt in a city
called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, &#145;He shall
be called a Nazarene.&#146;</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Master, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, who have long endured our transgressions, and
brought us to this hour in which hanging on the life-giving tree you showed the good Thief
the way into Paradise and destroyed death by death, have mercy also on us sinners and your
unworthy servants. For we have sinned and trespassed and are not worthy to raise our eyes
and look on the height of heaven; because we have abandoned the way of your justice and
walked in the will of our hearts. But we implore your unbounded goodness: spare us, O
Lord, according to the multitude of your mercy, and save us for your holy name&#146;s
sake, for our days have been wasted in vanity. Rescue us from the hand of our opponent,
forgive us our sins, slay our carnal will, that we, having put off the old man, may put on
the new, and live for you, our Master and benefactor; and that thus following your
precepts we may reach eternal rest, where those who rejoice have their dwelling. For you
are the true joy and gladness of those who love you, Christ our God, and to you we give
glory, together with your Father who has no beginning, and your all-holy, good and
life-giving Spirit, now and always and to ages of ages. Amen.</font></p>
