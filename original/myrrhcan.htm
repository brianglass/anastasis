him&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You were crucified in the flesh, though impassible
by the Father&#146;s nature; you were pierced in the side and became a source of blood and
water for the world. You are our God and we glorify you.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">I honour your Cross and glorify your burial, O Good
One. I praise and worship your Rising, and I cry out, &#145;You are our God and we glorify
you&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Though you tasted gall, O sweetness of the Church,
yet you poured out incorruption for us from your side. You are our God and we glorify you.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You were numbered among the dead, O Saviour, when
you raised the dead. You tasted corruption, for you knew nothing at all of destruction.
You are our God and we glorify you.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Let Zion rejoice, and let heaven be glad. Christ has
risen and raised the dead who sing in praise, &#145;You are our God and we glorify
you&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">In grave clothes Joseph wrapped your body, O Christ,
and laid you, our salvation, in a new tomb; but as God you raised the dead.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Anticipating the dawn, the women saw Christ and

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">When you nailed your palms to the Cross, O Jesu, and
gathered in all the nations from error, you invited them to knowledge of you, O Saviour.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Jewish people cried out to Pilate, &#145;Release
for me the wicked thief. As for the Sinless One, away with him, away with him, crucify
him&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">When you were crucified, O Christ, the light grew
dark, the earth was shaken and many dead rose from the tomb through fear of your might. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Standing by the Cross, O Jesu, your Ewe-lamb cried
out with lamentation, &#145;Where are you going, my Son? Where are you departing, Lamb who
is slain for all?&#146;</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">I worship your Cross, I praise your Burial, I honour
your sufferings, O Jesu, the nails in your hands, the lance and the Resurrection.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You arose, O Jesu; the enemy was despoiled, Adam,
and Eve with him, was delivered from bonds and corruption by your Resurrection.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">When you arose, O Christ, the bars and gates of Hell
were smashed, and the bonds of death immediately untied, through fear of your might.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Joseph, who received God, come, stand with us and
cry, &#145;He has risen, Jesus the redeemer, who raised Adam in his compassion!&#146;</font></p>

Myrrhbearing women, with Joseph and Christ&#146;s other Disciples, men and women.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">With the Father I worship and praise the Son and the

From you according to the flesh sprang Christ, the rod and the flower, for our sake.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 4. The Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Foreseeing your birth from a Virgin, the Prophet
cried out and proclaimed, &#145;I heard your report, O Christ, and was afraid, for you
came from Theman and from a holy shaded mountain.&#146;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Through a Cross you took prisoner the belly of Hell,
you raised the dead with you and overthrew the tyranny of death. Therefore we, Adam&#146;s
descendants, falling down in worship sing the praise of your burial and your Rising, O
Christ.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You were well pleased, our Saviour, through the
bowels of your mercy, to be nailed to the Cross, and to redeem us from the ancestral
curse. Release me from the bonds of my many offences, for you can accomplish whatever you
will. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Having nailed my ancient curse on the Cross, O
Saviour, and become a source of blessing for me through the blood from your side, release
me from the bonds of my many offences, for you can accomplish whatever you will. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">When Hell met you in the infernal regions, O
Saviour, he was embittered, seeing that the dead, whom he of old had had the strength to
swallow, now, unwilling, he was giving back. The depths below are being scoured, laid bare
and despoiled of the dead.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Though the stone was sealed, O lawless foes, and the
watch set, yet the Lord arose as he foretold, releasing the bonds of my many offences, for
he can accomplish whatever he wills.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Having risen from the dead, despoiled Hell, given
life to the dead and become for me a source of incorruption by your Rising, release the
bonds of my many offences, for you can accomplish whatever you will. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Be ashamed indeed, lawless ones, for Christ has
risen and raised the dead with him, crying, &#145;Be of good courage. I have conquered the
world&#146;. Obey him then, or keep silence, misguided ones, who deny his Resurrection. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Having risen from the tomb, O Good One, greeted the
Myrrhbearers with the cry, &#145;Rejoice&#146;, and commanded the Apostles, &#145;Proclaim
my Rising&#146;, release the bonds of my many offences, for you can accomplish whatever
you will. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Let us honour the noble Joseph, zealot for true
religion, counsellor and disciple, with the Myrrhbearers and the Apostles, as we cry out
with them, and with faith and gladness praise the Saviour&#146;s Resurrection.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Who can declare the indivisible glory of the Godhead
beyond all being? For a Trinity in nature is praised, without beginning, identical in
nature, praised as a Unity in Trinity, with simple substances.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Holy Virgin-mother, unceasingly implore the One who
dwelt in your womb, whom you bore without pangs, to release me from the bonds of my many
offences, for you can help whatever you will.</font></p>

of your commandments, shine on me as you alone are the King of Peace.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The ancient garment, which the sower of sin wove for
me, alas, you stripped off me, my Saviour, when you clothed yourself in me.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">My sin sewed fig leaves for me when I, alas, by the
counsel of the serpent did not keep your most pure commandment, my Saviour.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Coming upon my soul wounded by my thieving thoughts,
Christ, the child of Mary, poured oil on it and healed it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Standing by the Cross the blameless Mother of God
called out as a mother, &#145;You have left me behind alone, my Son and my God&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Having overthrown the serpent, origin of evil, with
the weapon of your Cross, you smashed the sting of death, O Jesu.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">&#145;Where death is your sting? Where Hell your
victory?&#146; Let Adam join the cry. You have been smashed by the return to life of him
who raised the dead.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Myrrh-bearing women, coming to the tomb of him
who gave life to those below, heard a voice saying, &#145;Christ has risen&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">As we celebrate the memory of the devout
Myrrhbearers and of all your Disciples, in your shining Rising, we sing your praise, O
Christ.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Let us all worthily honour the noble one who took
down the Lord&#146;s body from the tree and faithfully gave it burial.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">I worship God, Father and Son and Spirit, three
Persons, and I believe the one to be three with one Essence.</font></p>

conception beyond nature without seed to him who renews nature, Christ, the only Master.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 6. Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">I am ever held by an abyss of sins, and I am sinking
deep in the sea of life. But like Jonas from the beast, bring me up and save me.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Hell is dead. Take courage, you who are born of
earth, for Christ, hung upon the tree, has hurled away the sword against him and Hell lies
dead. For, stripped naked, he has been despoiled of those he held. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">&#145;Hell has been despoiled! Take courage you
dead! The graves have been opened, arise!&#146; Christ, who came to ransom all mankind
from death and corruption, cries out to you from Hell.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">&#145;Now, Hell, you have orders. Give me back the
dead you once had strength to swallow&#146;, the Life-giver and God, who came to ransom
all mankind from your insatiable maw, cries out to you.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Lord has risen, having despoiled the foe and
delivered the prisoners. He has brought back all mankind and raised Adam the first-formed,
for he is compassionate and loves mankind. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Having wrapped you in a winding sheet, O Christ, the
noble Joseph laid you in a grave. having anointed the temple of your body which had been
destroyed, he rolled a great stone to the mouth of the sepulcre.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O Myrrh-bearing women, why do you still hurry? Why
do you bring spices for the living? Christ has risen as he foretold. Let your tears cease:
they have changed to joy.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Let us believers praise the Trinity in Unity,
glorifying the Father with the Son, and the Spirit consubstantial with the Son, and him
who with the Father is without beginning and eternal God.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Like a vine, pure Maiden, you conceived unhusbanded
in your womb the Grape Cluster of incorruption, from which for us the streams of
immortality pour out, like wine, eternal life.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 7. Irmos. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Imitating the Cherubim, the Youths in the furnace,
danced and cried out, &#145;Blessed are you, O God, for with truth and judgement you have
brought all these things upon us because of our sins; you who are highly praised and
glorified to all the ages.&#146;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Wishing, as you love mankind, to save from error all
those you had fashioned, you endured being nailed to the Cross, that in your flesh, O
Saviour, you might renew the image smothered by the passions; and having overthrown Hell
you raised up the dead with yourself.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Lifted up on the cross, O Merciful, you called all
to yourself, as you had promised, O Good One; for you were well-pleased in truth to suffer
all these things because of our sins; so too you opened the gates of Paradise to the
thief, O Saviour. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The temple of your body, which had been destroyed,
you raised on the third day, as you had promised, O Good One, that in truth you might make
known your glory, which you pour out upon us through the faith, having freed the prisoners
whom Hell of old held captive.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O the madness of the Jews! O the frenzy of the
lawless! What had you seen which was unbelievable, that you did not believe Christ? That
he did not raise the sick with a word? That he did not save the whole world himself? If
not the soldiers, then let those risen from the dead convince you.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Let the guards, who became as dead men, now say how
he was stolen, whom they did not see, being wholly without sensation. For if they did not
see, did not perceive him risen, how then could they ever think he had been stolen? Let
them convince you, and also this stone and Christ&#146;s grave clothes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Why do you guard him like a corpse? Why have you set
seals on the stone, O Jews? Fearing theft? See, the tomb was truly sealed. How then did
Christ arise unless he was God? Let those who arose and were seen by many persuade you.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">With the Father we glorify the Son and the Holy
Spirit, crying out with unceasing voice, &#145;Trinity, single Essence, have mercy. Save
us all, Unity in three Persons. Have pity, O God, glorified to the ages&#146;.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Both now. </font><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">How did you contain as a child in your womb, O
Immaculate, him before whom as God the angelic powers tremble? Unless as he willed, as he
knew how, he took up his dwelling, wishing to save the those born from earth, Adam&#146;s
seed, by freeing Adam from that curse which came through the bitter eating.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 8. Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The One who foreshadowed for Moses in the bush on
Mount Sinai the wonder of the Virgin, praise, bless and highly exalt to all the ages.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The rays of the sun cowered with fear at the
sufferings of Christ, the dead were raised, the mountains were shaken, the earth quaked
and Hell was stripped bare.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The thrice-blessed Youths in the furnace of old
raised their hands, typifying your most pure Cross, through which, O Christ, you overthrew
the power of the foe.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O blind Jews, deceivers and transgressors, who do
not trust Christ&#146;s Resurrection, as though it was a lie, what do you see that you
cannot believe? That Christ has risen, he who raised the dead?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O hostile Jews, even though you do not believe us,
ask your own soldiers what they experienced. Who with their hands rolled the stone away
from the grave?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Who withered the fig-tree? Who healed the withered
hand? Who once fed the multitudes in the desert? If not Christ God, who raised the dead.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Who gave light to the blind, healed lepers, cured
the lame and walked on the sea dry-shod as though on land? If not Christ God, who raised
the dead.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Who raised from the tomb one four days dead, and the
widow&#146;s son? Who gave strength to the paralytic on his bed? If not Christ God, who
raised the dead.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The stone itself cries out, the seals, which you
placed yourselves when you posted the sentries to guard the grave, shout aloud,
&#145;Christ has risen indeed, and lives to the ages&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Christ has risen indeed, Hell is despoiled, the
serpent slain, Adam redeemed, those below are saved. Why do you persist in unbelief, foes
and transgressors?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">With the Father we glorify the Son and the Holy
Spirit, the holy Trinity in one Godhead, as we cry, &#145;Holy, Holy, Holy are you to the
ages&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">In your womb, pure Maiden, you bore without change
the ever-living bread, compounded uncompoundedly with our composition, one Christ, God, in
the two Essences.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 9. Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The one who in her womb conceived in flesh the Word,
who shone from the Father beyond time, in never-silent hymns let us the faithful magnify.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The thief who acknowledged you on the Cross as God,
All-powerful Saviour, you made heir to the spiritual Paradise when he cried,
&#145;Remember&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You were struck, you were spat upon by the lawless
for our sake, O Jesu, who traced the tables of the law on Sinai for your servant Moses.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You were given vinegar and gall to drink for our
sake, O Saviour, who give us your Body and your precious Blood as the food and drink of
your eternal life.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">When your life-giving side was pierced by the lance,
O Christ, you poured out your immaculate Blood and precious Water as an ever-living spring
for the world.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You, who brought the dead to life, were numbered
among the dead. You, who emptied the tombs, were laid in a tomb. You despoiled Hell in
raising Adam.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You arose, O Jesu. The foe was bound, Hell
despoiled, tombs stripped bare, those below raised, as they worshipped you, O Christ.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Who stole the dead body? And moreover naked? Why are
you deceived, O Jews? Christ has risen and the bonds and bars of hell have been unloosed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory to you, Christ Saviour, who poured out life,
made light dawn for those in the darkness of ignorance, and shone over all the earth by
your Rising.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Let the noble counsellor Joseph be praised with the
Myrrhbearers and the godly Disciples, as he too is a herald of Christ&#146;s Rising.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You are without beginning, O Father; you are
uncreated, O Son; you are equal in rank, O Holy Spirit; the three one in nature and three
