<p align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Book Antiqua" size="5">INTRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">This provisional translation of the Burial Service for
Lay People is based on the text of the Large Euchologion, which is to all intents and
purposes identical to that in the Slavonic Trebnik. The service is seldom performed in
full, and the modern Greek books give it in the abbreviated form as it is commonly
performed in Greek parishes. In current Greek use the service starts with the usual
blessing by the Priest and Psalm 90 is omitted. I have included in square brackets the
usual selection of verses from Psalm 118 used in Greek churches. The Canon, which is the
one for Saturday Matins in Tone 6 in the Paraklitiki, is usually omitted, though the
Russian use is normally to sing just the Irmi, which are therefore included within
brackets, with the refrains. These Irmi are not sung in Athonite use, except where they
are used as Katavasias. The refrains given here are those used on the Holy Mountain. In
Russian use the refrain for the first two Troparia is, &#145;Give rest to the soul of your
servant fallen asleep&#146;. The translation of the Canon attempts, I hope without too
much infidelity to the original, to preserve Saint Theophanes&#146; acrostic.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">I have not included any of the prayers of absolution
which are sometimes used at the very end of the service in church. They are not found in
the Large Euchologion, though they do occur in the modern Greek books to be said by a
Bishop, if one is present. The Trebnik gives a much less elaborate absolution, to be given
by a Bishop, or in his absence by the Priest.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">It will seldom be necessary to sing all the Prosomia
provided for the moment of the final farewell. The model melody to which they are written
is that of the Aposticha of Vespers of Good Friday, which are sung at the moment when the
Epitaphios is brought out into the centre of the Church. This is almost certainly
intentional.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The current Greek books begin the rite in the church
with the usual blessing by the Priest, since nowadays the funeral may take place some
time, even days, after the body has been placed in the church. The provision for the small
litany between Psalm 118 and the Evlogitaria is quite anomalous, since it should follow
the latter, and I have therefore omitted it. The modern Greek books also invert the rites
at the graveside and provide a verse from Psalm 50, &#145;You will sprinkle me with
hyssop&#146;, as the oil from the lamp is poured into the grave. This is not found in
either the Large Euchologion or the Trebnik. Customs at the graveside vary a good deal and
so do the texts of the service books. These local customs are not detailed here.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">This translation also provides all the texts necessary
for a full Memorial Service, or Pannychida, except that the Russian books have a full
Litany of Peace after Psalm 90 and the Canon is that in Tone 8.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="6">THE FUNERAL SERVICE</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5">IN THE HOUSE</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#800080"><big>When an Orthodox Christian dies the
relatives at once send for the Priest. When he comes to the house where the body is lying
he puts on his Epitrachelion and puts incense in the censer, then he gives the usual
blessing and those present begin the Trisagion etc.</big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us (<font color="#800080">three times</font>).</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy
Spirit, both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us
from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for
your name&#146;s sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed, your
kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and
forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors, and do not lead us into temptation, but
deliver us from the evil one.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#800080">Priest: </font>For yours is the

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#800080"><big>Then the following

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">With the spirits of the righteous made perfect in death
give rest, O Saviour, to the soul of your servant; keeping it for the life of blessedness
with you, O Lover of mankind.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">In your repose where all your saints find rest, give
rest, O Lord, to the soul[s] of your servant[s], for you alone are immortal.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the Holy Spirit.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You are our God who descended into Hell and did away
with the pains of those who had been bound; give rest, O Saviour, also to the soul of your
servant.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Both now and for ever, and to the ages of
ages. Amen. <font color="#800080">Theotokion.</font></font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">O God of spirits and all flesh, who trampled down death

your servant <font color="#800080">N</font>., who has fallen asleep, in a place of light,
a place of green pasture, a place of refreshment, whence pain, grief and sighing have fled
away. Pardon, O God, as you are good and love mankind, every sin committed by him/her in

are without sin; your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and your word is
truth.</font></big></p>

blessing.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#800080"><big>The Priest gives the
Dismissal as follows:</big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">May he who has authority over the living and the dead,
as immortal King, and who rose from the dead, Christ, our true God, through the
intercessions of his most pure and blameless Mother, of the holy, glorious and all-praised
Apostles, of our venerable and God-bearing fathers, of the holy and glorious forefathers,
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, of the holy and righteous Lazarus, for four days dead, the
friend of Christ, and of all the Saints, establish in the tents of the righteous the soul
of his servant who has gone from us, give him/her rest in the bosom of Abraham, and number
him/her with the righteous; and have mercy on us and save us, for he is good and loves
mankind.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Eternal your memory, our brother/sister, worthy of

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#800080"><big>If everything is ready for the
Departure, the Priest again gives the blessing and we begin to sing the Trisagion with
fear and great compunction. And having taken up the body we leave for the Church, the
Priests going ahead with lights and the Deacon with the censer. </big></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="6">IN THE CHURCH</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#800080"><big>When they reach the Church the body is
placed in the Narthex, and they begin Psalm 90. </big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#800080">Psalm 90</font><br>
One who dwells in the help of the Most High will live under the protection of the of the
God of heaven; will say to the Lord: You are my protector and my refuge, my God, and I
shall hope in him. For he will deliver you from the hunters&#146; snare, and from the word
which troubles. He will overshadow you with his wings, and under his feathers you will
have hope; his truth will encircle you with a shield. You will not be afraid of terror by
night, of the arrow that flies by day; of the thing that prowls in the darkness, of mishap
or of the noonday devil. A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right,
but it will not come near you. But with your eyes you will observe, and see the reward of
sinners. For you, Lord, are my hope: you have made the Most High your refuge. Evils will
not approach you, nor a scourge draw near your dwelling, because he has given orders to
his Angels about you, to guard you in all your ways. They will bear you on their hands,
lest you dash your foot against a stone. You will walk on asp and basilisk, and trample
down lion and dragon. Because he/she hoped in me, I shall deliver him/her; I shall shelter
him/her, because he/she knew my name. He/she will cry to me, and I shall hear him/her, I
am with him/her in trouble; I shall rescue him/her and glorify him/her. I shall fill
him/her with length of days, and show him/her my salvation.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#800080"><big>And after this in a
louder voice:</big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Blessed are you, O Lord; teach me your statutes.
Blameless in the way. Alleluia.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#800080">And we sing the 1st

Incline my heart to your testimonies, and not to covetousness. Alleluia.<br>
Dejection took hold of me because of sinners who abandon your law. Alleluia.<br>

is forcibly parted from the body, from its frame, and how that most natural bond of union
is cut off by the will of God. Therefore we entreat you: Give rest in the tents of your

happiness which does not age.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Your command which fashioned me was my beginning and my
substance; for wishing to compose me as a living creature from visible and invisible
nature, you moulded my body from the earth, but gave me a soul by your divine and

beg for rest.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">I grieve and lament when I contemplate death, and see
the beauty fashioned for us in God&#146;s image lying in the graves, without form, without

Brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant about those who have fallen asleep, so that you
may not grieve like the rest who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose
again, so too God will bring with him those who sleep through Jesus. We tell you this by
the Lord&#146;s word, that we who are left alive at the Lord&#146;s coming will by no
means precede those sleep. Because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
at the voice of an Archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise
first. Then we who are left alive will be snatched up together with them in the clouds to
meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall all be with the Lord.</font></big></p>

The Lord said to the Jews who had come to him, &#145;Amen, Amen I say to you, that one who
hears my word and believes in him who sent me has eternal life; and is not coming to
judgement, but has passed over from death to life. Amen, Amen I say to you that the hour
is coming and is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who
have heard will live. For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to Son
to have life in himself. And he has given him authority to deliver judgement also, because
he is son of man. Do not marvel at this; because the hour is coming in which all who are
in the tombs will hear his voice; and they will come out, those who have done good to the
resurrection of life, but those who have done ill to the resurrection of judgement. I can
do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge, and my judgement is just; because I do not seek
my will, but the will of the Father who sent me&#146;.</font></big></p>

O God of spirits and all flesh, who trampled down death and crushed the devil, giving life

who has fallen asleep, in a place of light, a place of green pasture, a place of

and love of mankind, every sin committed by him/her in word or deed or thought, because
there is no one who will live and not sin, for you alone are without sin; your
righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and your word is truth.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">For you are the resurrection, the life and the repose of
your servant <font color="#800080">N.</font>, who has fallen asleep, Christ our God, and

Greeting takes place, and we sing the following Verses, prosomia.<br>
Tone 2. When from the tree.</big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Come, let us give the final kiss, brethren, to the dead,
as we give thanks to God; because he/she has left his/her family and is hastening to the
grave, he/she has no further care for things of no moment, affairs of the much-wearied
flesh. Where now are his/her relatives and friends? Now as we are parted let us pray that
the Lord will give him/her rest.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">What is this parting, O brethren? What the grieving,
what the lamentation in this present instant? Come then, kiss him/her who a moment ago was
with us; he/she is being entrusted to a grave, covered by a stone, left to dwell in
darkness, buried with the dead; all we his/her relatives and friends as we are now being
parted, let us pray that the Lord will give him/her rest.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Now the whole wretched festival of life&#146;s vanity is
being dissolved; for the spirit has left its dwelling, the clay has turned black, the
vessel has been broken, without voice, without sensation, without movement; as we escort
him/her to the grave. Let us pray that the Lord will give him/her rest for ever.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">What is our life? Merely a flower, a vapour and morning
dew. Come then, let us look closely at the graves; where is the body&#146;s beauty? Where
its youth? Where are the eyes and the form of the flesh? All have withered like grass, all
have vanished; come, let us fall down before Christ with tears.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Great the weeping and lamentation, great the sighing and
constraint at the parting of the soul; Hell and destruction, the life of transitory
things, the insubstantial shadow, the sleep of error, the untimely fancied toil of earthly
life. Let us fly far from every worldly sin that we may inherit the things of heaven.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">As we look on one who lies dead let us accept this
expression of the final moment; for he/she passes like smoke from the earth, he/she
blossomed like a flower, was cut down like grass, is wrapped in a winding sheet, hidden in
earth. When we have left him/her out of sight, let us pray to Christ to give him/her rest
for ever.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Come, offspring of Adam, let us look at one in our image
who has been laid in earth, who has discarded all his/her beauty, been dissolved in a
grave by the rottenness of worms, wasted by darkness, hidden in earth. When we have left
him/her out of sight, let us pray to Christ to give him/her rest for ever.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">When the soul is about to be snatched by force from the
body by fearsome Angels, it forgets relatives and friends and its concern is for its stand
at the coming trial of vanity and much wearied flesh. Come, let us all beseech the Judge
and pray that the Lord pardon all that he/she has done.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Come, brethren, let us look in the tomb at the ashes and
dust, from which we were fashioned. Where are we now going? What have we become? What is a
poor person, what a rich? What a master, what a free? Are they not all ashes? The beauty
of the face has rotted and death has withered all the flower of youth.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Truly all the pleasant and glorious things of life are
vanity and corruption! For we all depart, we shall all die, monarchs and rulers, judges
and potentates, rich and poor and every mortal being. For now those that were once in life
have been cast into tombs. May the Lord give them rest we pray.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Now all the body&#146;s organs are idle, that a little
while ago were active; all useless, dead, insensible; for eyes are dimmed, feet bound,
hands lie still and hearing with them, tongue is locked in silence, is entrusted to a
grave; truly everything human is vanity.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Save those who hope in you, All-pure Mother of the
unsetting Sun, who bore God; with your prayers, we beg you, ask him who is supremely good
to give rest where the souls of the righteous are at rest to him/her who has passed over;
make him/her heir to good things in the courts of the just to eternal memory.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Glory. <font color="#800080">Tone 6.</font></font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">As you see me lying without voice and without breath,
all weep for me, brothers and friends, relatives and acquaintances; for only yesterday I
was talking with you, and suddenly the dread hour of death came upon me. But come, all who
loved me, and kiss me for the last time; for I shall not walk with you again, nor speak
with you any more; because I am on my way to the Judge, with whom there is no respect of
persons; for slave and master stand alike before him, king and soldier, rich and poor,
with the same rank; for each will be glorified or shamed in accordance with their own
deeds. But I ask and implore you all, pray for me without ceasing to Christ God, that I
may not be condemned because of my sins to the place of torment, but that he will
establish me in the place of the light of life.</font></big></p>
