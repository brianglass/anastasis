first Kathisma of the Psalter, at</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Lord I have

directs.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Tone 8</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>We offer you, O Christ, an evening hymn and spiritual worship; because you were
well-pleased to have mercy on us through the Resurrection.</p>

<p>Lord, Lord, do not cast us away from your presence; but be well-pleased to have mercy
on us through the Resurrection.</p>

<p>Hail holy Sion, Mother of the Churches, dwelling-place of God; for it was you who first
received forgiveness of sins through the Resurrection.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Other Stichera, by Anatolios</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Word begotten of God the Father before the ages, but in the last times incarnate of
her who knew not wedlock, willingly endured the crucifixion of death, and mankind, slain
of old, He saved through his own Resurrection.</p>

<p>We glorify your Resurrection from the dead, O Christ, through which You freed Adam's
race from the tyranny of Hades, and as God granted the world eternal life and your great
mercy.</p>

<p>Glory to you, Christ Saviour, only-begotten Son of God, nailed to the cross and risen
from the tomb on the third day.</p>

<p>We glorify you, Lord, who willingly endured the cross for us, and we worship you,
all-powerful Saviour; do not cast us away from your presence, but hearken and save us
through your Resurrection, O Lover of mankind.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The King of heaven through love for mankind appeared on earth and lived among men; for
taking flesh from a pure Virgin and coming forth from her with the addition, he is one
Son, double in nature, but not in person; therefore proclaiming him as truly perfect God
and perfect man, we confess Christ our God; implore him, Mother without bridegroom, to
have mercy on our souls.</font></p>

<p>O Jesu, who came down from heaven, You ascended the Cross; you, immortal Life, came to
death; the true Light, to those in darkness; the Resurrection of all to those who had
fallen. Our illumination and our Saviour, glory to you.</font></p>

<p>Verse 1:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> The Lord is King: he has robed

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Let us glorify Christ who rose from the dead: for having taken a body and a soul, he
parted them from one another by the passion; for his soul descended into Hades, whom he
despoiled, while the holy body of the Redeemer of our souls did not know corruption in the
tomb.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse 2:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> He has made the world firm; it will
not be shaken.</p>

<p>We glorify your Resurrection from the dead, O Christ, in psalms and hymns. Through it
you have freed us from the tyranny of Hades, and as God granted us eternal life and your
great mercy.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse 3:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Holiness befits your house, O Lord,
to length of days.</p>

<p>You, Master of all things, incomprehensible Maker of heaven and earth, by suffering the
Cross became for me the source of dispassion. Accepting burial and rising in glory, you
raised Adam with you by your all-powerful hand. Glory to your Rising on the third day,
through which you have granted us eternal life and forgiveness of sins, as you alone are
compassionate.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> Theotokion</font></p>

<p>Virgin without bridegroom, who ineffably conceived God, accept the supplications of
your servants, all-spotless Mother of God most high, who grant to all cleansing from
faults, now receive our entreaties and beg that we may all be saved.</font></p>

<p>You came down from on high, O Compassionate, you accepted burial for three days, that
you might free us from the passions. Our Life and Resurrection, Lord, glory to you.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You were born for us from a Virgin, and endured crucifixion, loving Lord; by your death
you despoiled Death, and revealed resurrection as God; do not despise those whom you
fashioned with your own hand; show us your compassion, O Merciful; accept the Mother of
God who bore you as she intercedes for us, and save, our Saviour, a people in despair.</font>
