<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="6">FIRST HOUR</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Note that on the Mondays of holy Lent we do not add a Kathisma of the Psalter
at the First Hour. On the other days we do, and we make 3 prostrations at each
Antiphon. The First Hour being joined to the Morning Office, as has been said
above, begins straight away with:</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Come, let us worship and fall down before the King, our God.<br>
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ, the King, our God.<br>
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King, our God.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Three Metanias and the Psalms:</p>
<p>Psalm 5<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Give ear to my words, O Lord,
understand my cry. Attend to the voice of my supplication, my King and my God;
for to you I shall pray, O Lord. In the morning you will hear my voice. In the
morning I shall stand before you, and you will watch over me; because you are
not a God who wants iniquity. The evildoer will not dwell with you, nor will the
lawless remain before your eyes. You have hated all those who work iniquity; you
will destroy all those who speak lies. The Lord abhors a man of bloodshed and
deceit. But I in the abundance of your mercy shall enter your house, I shall
worship towards your holy temple in fear of you. Guide me, Lord, in your
righteousness because of my enemies, direct my way before you. Because there is
no truth in their mouths; their heart is vain. Their throat is an open tomb,
they deceive with their tongues. Judge them, O God. Let them fall through their
counsels; according to the multitude of their impieties cast them out, for they
have embittered you, O Lord. And may all those who hope in you be glad; they
will rejoice for ever, and you will dwell among them, and all those who love
your name will boast in you. Because you will bless the righteous; you have
crowned him, O Lord, with your good pleasure.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 89</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
Lord, you have been our refuge from one generation to another. Before the
mountains came into being or the earth and the world was formed, from age to age
you are. Do not turn mankind back to humiliation, and you said: Turn back,
children of men. Because a thousand years in your eyes, O Lord, are like a day,
or like yesterday which has passed, and like a watch in the night. Their years
will be mere trifles, in the morning like grass may he pass away. In the morning
let him flower and pass away; in the evening let him fall, dry up and wither.
Because we have perished in your anger, and in your wrath we have been dismayed.
You have set our iniquities before you; our age in the light of your
countenance. Because all our days have perished, and in your anger we have
perished; our years they considered like a spider. The days of our years there
are seventy years in them, but if we are strong, eighty, and the majority of
them are labour and toil; because weakness has come over us and we shall be
chastened. Who knows the might of your anger? And can gauge your wrath from fear
of you? So make your right hand known to me, and those chastened in heart by
wisdom. Turn back, O Lord, how long? And be entreated for your servants. We have
been filled in the morning with your mercy, O Lord, and we have rejoiced and
been glad. In all our days let be glad; in return for the days when you humbled
us, the years when we saw evils. And look upon your servants and upon the work
of your hands and guide your children. And let the brightness of the Lord be
upon us, and direct the works of our hands for us and direct the work of our
hand.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 100.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
I will sing to you of mercy and judgement, O Lord, I will chant and think on a
blameless way: when will you come to me? I have walked in the midst of my house
in the innocence of my heart. I have set no lawless deed before my eyes; I have
hated those who commit transgressions. No twisted heart has been attached to me;
the evil man who avoids me I have not acknowledged. The man who secretly
slanders his neighbour, him I have driven out. With a man of proud looks and
insatiate heart, I have not eaten. My eyes are upon the faithful in the land,
for them to dwell with me; the man who walks on a blameless way, he has
ministered to me. The man who acts proudly has not dwelt in my house; the man
who speaks calumnies has not prospered before me. Morning by morning I slew all
the sinners in the land, to purge from the Lord’s city all workers of
iniquity.</p>
<p>Glory. Both now. Alleluia (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">x3</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">).
Lord, have mercy (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">x3</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">).</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Then the Canonarch or the designated Monk chants following in the middle in
the 6th Tone.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Hearken to my voice in the morning, my King and my God.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>And as we repeat it, he makes a genuflexion to the ground; and the same at
the following Verses. Then he makes a bow in front of the Beautiful Gate and
returns to his place.</p>
<p>Verse 1:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Give ear to my words, O
Lord, understand my cry.</p>
<p>Hearken to my voice in the morning, my King and my God.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Verse 2: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">For to you I shall pray, O
Lord. In the morning you will hear my voice.</p>
<p>Hearken to my voice in the morning, my King and my God.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Theotokion:</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>What shall we call you, O Full of grace? Heaven? For you made the Sun of
righteousness to dawn. Paradise? For you made the flower of incorruption
blossom. Virgin? For you remained incorrupt. Pure Mother? For you held in your
holy embrace a Son who is the God of all. Implore him that our souls may be
saved.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Then we chant the following Verses, doubling the first three and tripling the
last, chanting it loudly and slowly:</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Direct my steps according to your word, and let no iniquity lord it over me.
(</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>
<p>Deliver me from the slander of men, and I shall keep your commandments. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>
<p>Let your face shine on your servant, and teach me your statutes. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>
<p>Let my mouth be filled with your praise, O Lord, that I may hymn your glory,
all day long your splendour. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Three
times</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>On the Monday, Wednesday and Friday of the 4th week of Lent, that is after
the Sunday of the Veneration of the Cross, instead of the verses of </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Direct
my steps,</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> we say:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"></p>

pardon our iniquities. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for your name’s
sake. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.</p>

us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but
deliver us from the evil one.</p>

<p>On Monday, Tuesday and Thursday say the following:<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">With heart and mouth never silent let
us hymn the most glorious Mother of God, holier than the Angels, confessing her
to be Mother of God, for she truly gave birth to God incarnate, and intercedes
unceasingly for our souls.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>But on Wednesday and Friday we say this:<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Before we are enslaved, speedily
prevent the foes who blaspheme you and threaten us, O Christ our God; destroy by
your Cross those who war against us; may they know how strong is the faith of
the Orthodox; through the intercessions of the Mother of God, O lover of
mankind.</p>

<p>But on Saturday, say this:<br>

the whole world offers you, who planted creation, the god-bearing Martyrs; at
their intercessions keep your Church in profound peace, through the Mother of
God, O most merciful.</p>

<p>In the 4th week of Lent we say the Kontakion of the Cross.</p>
<p>Then: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, have mercy. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">x40</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>
<p>At every time and at every hour, in heaven and on earth worshipped and
glorified, Christ God, longsuffering, great in mercy, great in compassion,
loving the just and merciful to sinners, calling all to salvation by the promise
of the blessings to come; do you, Lord, yourself accept our entreaties at this
hour, and direct our lives to your commandments. Sanctify our souls, purify our
bodies, correct our thoughts, cleanse our ideas and deliver us from every
distress, evil, and pain. Wall us about with your holy Angels, that protected
and guided by their host we may reach the unity of the faith and the knowledge
of your unapproachable glory; for you are blessed to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<p>Lord, have mercy (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">x3</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">).
Glory. Both now. Greater in honour than the Cherubim, and beyond compare more
glorious than the Seraphim, without corruption you gave birth to God the Word,
truly the Mother of God we magnify you. In the name of the Lord, bless, Father.</p>
