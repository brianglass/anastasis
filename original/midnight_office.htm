dawn and to glorify your might. And now, enlighten the eyes of my mind and open
my mouth to meditate on your words, to understand your commandments and to do
your will, and to sing to you with confession of heart and to hymn your all-holy

</font></b><font FACE="Book Antiqua">Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with
your great mercy. According to the multitude of your compassion blot out my
offence. Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For
I acknowledge my wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you alone I
have sinned and done what is evil in your sight, that you may be justified in
your words and win when you are judged. For see, in wickedness I was conceived
and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have loved truth; you have shown me
the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop
and I shall be cleansed. You will wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow.
You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been humbled
will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not
cast me out from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give
me back the joy of your salvation, and establish me with your sovereign Spirit.
I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God,
the God of my salvation, deliver me from bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at
your justice. Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will proclaim your
praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it. You will not
take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a
broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your
good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well
pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings.
Then they will offer calves upon your altar.</p>

<p>I believe in one God, Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all

<p>And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten from the
Father before all ages. Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten not
made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made; for our
sake and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and was incarnate from the
Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man; he was crucified also for us
under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried; he rose again on the third
day, in accordance with the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven and is seated
at the right hand of the Father; he is coming again in glory to judge the living
and the dead; and his kingdom will have no end.</p>
<p>And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life, who proceeds from the
Father, who together with Father and Son is worshipped and together glorified;
who spoke through the Prophets. In one, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church; I
confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins. I await the resurrection of the
dead and the life of the age to come. Amen.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000">The following Note is found in the
Horologion before the Prayer of St Ephrem the Syrian</font></p>
<p>The word ‘Alleluia’ is Hebrew and in translation means ‘Praise the Lord’.
People use it as a sign of joy and an expression of gladness as they praise God
and thank him for his wonders, as is clear from the tile of many Psalms, to the
which the word is attached and also from what Tobit says about Jerusalem being
rebuilt again after its fall, that all its streets will say ‘Alleluia’
(13,18). It is also clear from the Apocalypse of John, who, after the fall and
disappearance of the spiritual Babylon, heard a loud voice from heaven saying
continuously, ‘Alleluia’ (13,2.20s; 19,1). Nevertheless Christ’s Church
among us uses the word not only for radiant and joyful days, as, for example, in
the Antiphons of the feasts of the Lord, ‘Save us who sing to you: Alleluia!’,
but also in many places in the daily day and night office. The word is
especially frequent in the rites for funerals and the mournful days of the
fasts, when ‘Alleluia’ is sung at Vespers in place of the normal Prokeimenon
and at Matins instead of ‘The Lord is God’. Of this ‘Alleluia’ here and
subsequently, the instruction of the Typikon says, ‘But if it is Alleluia’,
that is if there is a fast, if we do not sing, ‘The Lord is God’, we make
the full prostrations. Otherwise etc.</p>
<p>Note that the Latin Church has the opposite custom to us and expressly
forbids the use of Alleluia on fast days and at mournful rites, and limits it to
joyful days only, especially the day of Pascha, when they sing it very often, as
do the ‘Christ has risen’. But also, many Westerners when visiting one
another during the days of Pascha, or meeting in the road, give the greeting,
‘Happy Alleluia’, just as we use ‘Christ has risen’.</p>
