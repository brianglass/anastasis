<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="5" face="Book Antiqua">On taking care for
ourselves and fleeing sin&#146;s destructive places and ways.<br>
[Given on the Sunday of the Paralysed Man]</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Brethren and fathers, after the feast the season
invites us once again to talk with you and to return to the usual instruction. And we have
come with enthusiasm knowing that we are appointed for this, and woe to us if we do not
talk with you as much as possible. So, what is there to say in the present circumstances?
That each of you, like a merchant, having amassed spiritual wealth for himself during holy
Lent, has reached holy Pascha like a harbour, laden with many excellent stocks of virtue,
namely: fasting, vigil, prayer, hard work and all the other exertions of holiness. For a
physical harbour is not like a harbour of the mind. When someone comes to anchor in the
former, they ease off and have no worries about the storms and dangers of the sea. In the
latter on the contrary, the passions become more ferocious with the relaxation of the
flesh, and the spirits of wickedness join in the assault like storms: the spirit of
fornication, the spirit of gluttony, the spirit of avarice, the spirit of despondency, the
spirit of dejection, the spirit of pride. The fear is that we may be sunk in harbour.
David once looked unguardedly on Uria&#146;s wife, and readers know what he suffered. <i>Jacob
ate and was filled,</i> says Scripture, <i>and the beloved kicked </i>[Deut 32,15].
Someone touched without meaning to and they were enflamed to lust and gave birth to
iniquity.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Take care, you who are listening to this. <i> Flee
the destructive places and ways of sin</i>. Govern your sight, hearing, smell, taste and
touch, your food, drink and sleep, that you may keep from being overwhelmed by the tempest
of the passions. This is worth remembering: someone who sails across the physical sea is
subject to storms and tempests without their wanting it, while someone who crosses the
water of the mind is lord of tempest and of calm. For if they manfully shake off unseemly
thoughts, they are filled with calm, having the Holy Spirit as the companion of their
voyage, as it is related of Saint Arsenios. But one whose senses are unbridled and who
lets in desires like streams, stirs up a most dreadful storm for themselves. Unless the
person does not swiftly smooth out their tempestuous thoughts, will end by repeating those
miserable words, <i>I entered the depths of the sea, and a tempest drowned me </i>[Psalm
68,3]. Therefore let reason be in control, and let the better not be dragged down by the
worse, but let the spirit be master and act for the better. Or don&#146;t you know what
sin produces? Didn&#146;t it introduce death into the world? Didn&#146;t it destroy the
earth? Hasn&#146;t it filled the inhabited world with graveyards and tombs from the
beginning of time until now? For humanity was incorrupt before the fall and none of the
things I have mentioned would have started if the first-formed had steadfastly observed
the commandment that had been given. Sin is the cause of the everlasting punishments, the
fuel of the unquenchable fire of Gehenna, the food of the undying worm; sin that has made
humanity, that was in honour, be compared to the unreasoning beasts [Cf. Psalm 48,13.21].</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">And so, because sin is like all this, destructive
and deadly, we must flee from it, brethren, with all our might, and choose virtue, which
makes humans angels, raises them from death, resists the demons, overcomes the rulers of
this age, and finally betroths them to the kingdom of heaven. May we all reach it too by
the grace and love for humankind of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the
holy Spirit belong glory, might and honour, now and for ever, and the ages of ages. Amen.</font></p>
