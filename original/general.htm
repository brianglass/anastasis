<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font size="6">GENERAL MENAION</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="5">INTRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Many Orthodox Christians who want to make the daily
offices of the Church part of their prayer cannot afford, or do not have easy access to,
the complete set of service books of the Church. This even applies to a number of small
parishes and communities. In both the Greek and Slav traditions therefore compendia have
been published to meet this need. The Slavonic </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">General Menaion</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">, which contains
full offices for all possibilities, even for feasts of the Lord and Mother of God, and
provision for full festal celebration with Doxastika, Polyeleos and so forth, has been
translated a number of times into English. The equivalent Greek volume, called the </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Anthologion</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">, or Anthology, has not. Indeed it is not easy to obtain in Greek, since nowadays
most churches possess complete sets of service books, and a number of Greek publishing
houses have issued popular editions of all the books fairly cheaply, though many of these
are riddled with misprints. In English there does not as yet exist a complete set of
service books in any form. The following translation may therefore fill a need.</p>

<p>The Greek </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Anthologion</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> is not quite the same as the Slavonic </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">General Menaion</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">,, and its contents may be briefly described. The first part
gives the full office for the major feasts, including those of Saints who are, to use the
technical term, &#145;feasted&#146;. The second part gives a &#145;General Menaion&#146;
for &#145;anonymous Saints who are not feasted&#146;, what Western books would call the
&#145;Common of Saints&#146;. Each office therefore consists of the minimum requirement of
three Stichera for Vespers and a Canon, with the Kathisma after the third Ode, for Matins.
Some editions also give a Doxastikon at Vespers, &#145;if you want&#146; [to celebrate the
Saint with greater solemnity]. This provides enough material for ordinary Sundays and
weekdays.</p>

<p>In the </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Anthologion</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> this &#145;Common of Saints&#146; is preceded by a series of
three Stichera in each of the eight Tones to the Mother of God, it being assumed that at
Vespers three Stichera to the Mother of God will be sung and three to the Saint of the
day. The third part consists of an abbreviated Oktoichos for weekdays. This consists of
Aposticha for Vespers, and Kathismata and two Canons for Matins together with Aposticha
for Lauds. One Tone is used each day, Tones Three and Seven being omitted, probably
because they are considered the most &#145;secular&#146; of the eight.</p>

<p>The present translation differs from the printed books in one important respect.
Stichera for Vespers are given from the Paraklitiki for each day instead of the series of
ones to the Mother of God. The printed books often fail to give the text of the Theotokia
at Vespers, assuming that the user will know, or have access to suitable ones. These of
course should be ones written to the same melody as the Stichera for the Saint of the day,
and these have been provided in the present translation from elsewhere in the Paraklitiki
or Menaia.</p>

<p>The sources of the texts vary, many being simply offices for particular Saints adapted
for general use. Thus the Canon for the office for a Prophet is that for Saint Sophonias
on December 3rd, as the Acrostic in the Greek reveals. This accounts for fact that in each
Odes there are only three troparia, since the acrostic has only twenty four letters. The
Slavonic text, which does not attempt to reproduce the acrostic, has added a troparion in
each Ode to make them up the traditional four. The Canon for two or more Women Martyrs is
that for the feast of Saints Menodora, Mitrodora and Nymphodora on September 10th. Other
Canons have been truncated. Thus in the offices for one and for two or more Women Ascetics
the ninth Ode has been cut from five to four troparia. This is evident in each case
because the &#145;signature&#146; - J O S E PH - has been abbreviated, in one case to J S
E PH and in the other to O S E PH. No attempt has been made to reproduce the acrostics,
since experience shows that, though this is often possible, it tends to result in
excessively contorted and artificial English.</p>

<p>The texts of the offices are full of citations and allusions to Holy Scripture. Many of
these are only approximate since absolutely strict quotation is often not possible either
because of the exigencies of Greek grammar or the requirements of &#145;metre&#146; in
Stichera and Troparia. In a given context one word may be a allusion to a scriptural text.
Thus in the fourth Ode of a Canon the word &#145;horses&#146; is intended to evoke
Habbakuk 3:8, though it would not necessarily do so elsewhere. It should also be stressed
that these texts presuppose the use of the Christian, that is the Greek Septuagint, Old
Testament, rather than the current Hebrew Massoretic text.</p>

<p>The translation is on the whole conservative and keeps closely to the Greek, though I
have on occasion omitted adverbs like &#145;clearly&#146;, which are often included simply
for metrical reasons and add nothing to the sense. To avoid too much use of
&#145;one&#146; I have frequently added a noun like &#145;Saint&#146; to the numerous
adjectives used by themselves in Greek, especially in the &#145;vocative&#146;, such as
&#145;blessed&#146;, &#145;merciful&#146;, &#145;revered&#146; and so forth.</p>

<p>Normally the Canon of the Saint of the day will be sung last and therefore the Irmi of
the Odes will not be needed, except as &#145;Katavasias&#146; for the 3rd, 6th 8th and 9th
Odes. In Lent, however, the Canon from the Menaion is sung first. I have therefore
included all the Irmi, but placed in square brackets. This will obviate the need for the
use of the Irmologion, which is also a book that has not been translated and is not easy
to obtain even in the original Greek. The musical volume entitled </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#0000ff">Irmologion</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> only contains the irmi that are commonly sung, that is those for Sundays, major
feasts and Holy Week.</font>
