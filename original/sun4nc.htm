<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 1. Irmos. Through the Red Sea.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Let us glorify the Godhead, Trinity by persons, but a single nature of the three,
co-eternal, equal in majesty, whom we entreat, saying: Save those who glorify you with
faith!</p>

<p>The Son was anointed by the Father with the Spirit, the divine oil of gladness, and he
became mortal, and taught the triple personhood of the one Godhead.</p>

<p>The beauty of your unapproachable glory, O Unity of triple sun, the Seraphim cannot
bear to see and veil themselves with their wings and with thrice-holy songs unceasingly
glorify you.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You gave birth ineffably, O All-pure, to the Maker of all things who delivers mortals
from the ancient curse and the corruption of death; and through you we acknowledge one God
in three persons.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 3. Let us not boast.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>When you sent power from on high of old to your holy Apostles, O Christ, the Paraclete
from the Father, you revealed the one nature with triple sun.</p>

<p>When you appeared to the Patriarch Abraham in human form, O triple Unity, you revealed
the unchangeable nature of your lovingkindness and dominion.</p>

<p>O God, who are one, believed as in three persons, clearly uncircumscribed,
incomprehensible to all, deliver our souls from every affliction.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Instructed by the wise teaching of your Son, we glorify the single Godhead with triple
lights, and we call you, the Ever-Virgin, blessed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Kathisma. Come quickly to help.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Uncreated and consubstantial triple Sun, Unity in three persons and incomprehensible,
take pity on your servants, save them from dangers, as God of mercy; for we have gained
you, Lord, as our only Redeemer and Master as we cry: Be merciful to us!</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> Theotokion. The same.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Surrounded by many troubles and dread disasters, Virgin Mother of God, and ever falling
into despair, we have you as sole salvation, hope and wall, and as is fitting you we now
beseech in faith: Save your servants.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 4. The One enthroned in glory.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>With the Seraphim we glorify you, supreme Lordship, Trinity beyond being in unity of
Godhead, as of undivided nature, as without confusion, as exactly equal in glory, O God
beyond understanding.</p>

<p>Godhead ineffably divided in persons and identical in your one lordship, alone without
limit, uncircumscribed, the Maker of all creation, we sing your praise.</p>

<p>The Mind who is without beginning begot the Word ineffably, and sent out the divine
Spirit, equal in might; and therefore we proclaim a consubstantial Trinity, the Master of
all things as God.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Appearing to those of old in types, the Word proclaimed beforehand his incarnation from
you, O Virgin; but later he appeared to humankind in reality and revealed one Principle in
three persons.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 5. The universe was amazed.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Understanding from faith one unapproachable essence, but three consubstantial
life-giving persons of the omnipotent Godhead, we honour Father, Son and Spirit, the holy
co-eternal existence.</p>

<p>O single Godhead with triple sun, make the radiance of your essential splendour shine
on me, O uncreated Nature, illuminating Source of every light-giving ray, that I may
behold, as in a glass, your ineffable beauty.</p>

<p>Knowing you as only creator and sustainer and truly all-wise governor of the universe
and giver of life, we cry out to you in faith: Master of triple sun, guard those who sing
your praise.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Wishing to make divine humanity that had been corrupted of old, the One who fashioned
it and revealed the divine form of the image became man from you, O Virgin, and proclaimed
one threefold Deity.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 6. Prefiguring the three-day.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Father as he spoke revealed the sonship and the Spirit that appeared to Christ at
his baptism; therefore we glorify a Deity one and threefold.</p>

<p>When Isaias saw you seated upon a lofty throne being praised with thrice-holy hymns, he
came to know the triple substance of the one Deity.</p>

<p>Exalted King in three persons, show forth the hearts of your servants to be on high,
that we may radiantly contemplate the splendour of your glory.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>As he loves humankind the Son of God vouchsafed to be conformed to our nature from a
Virgin, and he made humankind partaker in the divine glory.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Kathisma. Come quickly to help.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>As we understand the Father to be unbegotten, the Son to be begotten and the Spirit to
proceed from the Father, we proclaim a Kingship without beginning and one Godhead, which
we glorify as we cry out with one accord: Consubstantial Trinity save us, O God.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now. Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The God who is beyond times and before the ages, the God-man, you bore in time beyond
nature in the flesh; therefore as we all confess you to be really and truly Mother of God,
we cry out to you insistently: Count us all worthy of eternal glory.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 7. The Children of Abraham.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>All we born of earth, imitating the ranks of heavenly natures and the spiritual orders,
with right belief glorify one Godhead in three persons equal in operation. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>The sayings of the holy Prophets foreshowed you of old in symbols as one creator of all
the ages, God inexpressible and Lord in three persons.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Almighty Word, who cannot be seen in your own being, you appeared to humankind as a man
from the pure Mother of God, restoring humankind to participation in your Godhead.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 8. Stretching out his hands.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Light ruling as one and Essence shining with triple radiance, infinite beauty make your
dwelling in my heart, and show me to be a pure and radiant temple of your Godhead, as I
cry: Bless the Lord, all you works of the Lord! (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>From the manifold passions and the gloom of offences rescue me, O undivided Trinity,
unconfused Unity, and enlighten me with your divine rays, that I may contemplate your
glory and hymn you, Lord of glory.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>O Mind, unbegotten Father, and Word, one form with him, and Spirit identical in throne,
Essence, Power, Existence beyond being, inexpressible, mighty in works, Trinity, Unity,
guard your flock at the prayers of the Mother of God, as by nature you love humankind.</font></p>

Save me your servant from temptations and afflictions of every kind. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>Raise our mind and thought to you, the Most High, who dwell in approachable light, and
enlighten them with your most pure radiance, Father, Word and Paraclete, sun of glory,
lord of light, that we may always glorify you, God, sole Sovereign and of three Persons.</font></p>
