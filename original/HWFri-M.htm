<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>After the Dismissal of the Midnight Office the Priest, having made the customary
metania to the Superior, or to his stall, enters the sanctuary and makes three bows before
the holy Table. He puts on the Epitrachelion and, standing in front of the holy Table,
intones:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>The Priest blesses the incense and begins to cense the sanctuary and the whole church
as usual.</p>

<p>Reader:<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Come, let us worship and fall down before the
King, our God.<br>
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ the King, our God.<br>
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King, our God.<br>
With three metanias; then the following two psalms.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Psalm 19<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may
the name of the God of Jacob shield you. May he send you his help from the holy place, and
support you from Sion. May he remember your every sacrifice, and accept with favour your
whole burnt offering. May the Lord give you your heart&#146;s desire, and fulfil your
every purpose. We shall rejoice in your salvation, and be magnified in the name of our the
Lord our God. May the Lord fulfil all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved
his Christ. He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty acts is the salvation of his
right hand. Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will call on the
name of the Lord our God. They were fettered and fell, but we have risen and been set
upright. Lord, save the king, and hear us on the day we call upon you.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Psalm 20<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The king will rejoice in your power, O Lord, he
will exult exceedingly in your salvation. You gave him his heart&#146;s desire; you did
not deny him the request of his lips. For you came to meet him with blessings of goodness;
you placed a crown of precious stones upon his head. He asked you for life, and you gave
him length of days for age on age. Great is his glory because of your salvation; you will
place on him glory and majesty. For you will give him blessing for age on age, and make
him glad with the joy of your countenance. For the king puts his hope in the Lord, and
through the mercy of the Most High he will not be shaken. May your hand light upon all
your enemies, and your right hand find out all who hate you. You will make them like a
blazing oven at the time of your presence. The Lord will confound them in his wrath and
fire will devour them. You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their seed
from among the children of humankind. Because they intended evils against you, and devised
plans by which they can in no way succeed. For you will put them to flight; among your
remnants you will prepare their presence. Be exalted, Lord, in your power; we will sing
and praise your mighty acts.</p>

<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; both now and for ever, and
to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p>Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">three times</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>Our Father, in heaven, may your name be hallowed; your kingdom come; your will be done
on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we
forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.</font></p>

<p>The priest must take care that he is standing beneath the Polyeleos to say this
conclusion. He then enters the sanctuary, puts away the censer and takes his stand in

Superior, or the designated reader, with devotion and fear of God says:</font></p>

<p>Psalm 3<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, why have those who afflict me been
multiplied? Many rise against me. Many say to my soul, &#145;There is no salvation for him
in his God&#146;. But you, Lord, are my helper, my glory, and the one who lifts up my
head. With my voice, I cried to the Lord, and he heard me from his holy mountain. I lay
down and slept; I awoke, because the Lord will assist me. I will not be afraid of tens of
thousands of people who surround me. Rise, Lord, save me, my God; because you have struck
all who are vainly my foes. You have smashed the teeth of sinners. Salvation is the
Lord&#146;s, and your blessing is upon your people.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 37<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor
chastise me in your wrath. For your arrows have been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a
heavy hand upon me. There is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in
my bones on account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my head; like a heavy burden
they weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank and festered on account of my foolishness. I
was wretched and utterly bowed down; I went about mourning all day long. For my loins were
filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated
exceedingly; I howled from the groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you,
and my groaning was not hidden from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and
even the light of my eyes had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and
stood against me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life used
force, and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and meditated trickeries all day
long. But I, like a deaf man, heard nothing; like one who is dumb, who does not open his
mouth. So I became like one who cannot hear, and in whose mouth there are no rebukes. For
in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will answer me, O Lord my God. For I said: Let my foes
never exult over me. When my foot slipped they crowed over me. For I am ready for blows
and my pain is with me continually. For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my
sin. But my enemies live and have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly have
been multiplied. Those who repay me with evils in place of good have slandered me, since I
pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not go far from me. Hasten to help
me, Lord of my salvation.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 62<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">O God, my God, I watch for you at dawn; my soul
has thirsted for you, my flesh how often in a desert, untrodden and waterless land. Thus I
appeared before you in the holy place, to see your power and your glory. For your mercy is
better than life; my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live, and in
your name I will lift up my hands. May my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; my
mouth will praise you with joyful lips. When I remembered you upon my bed, every dawn I
meditated upon you. For you became my helper, and in the shelter of your wings I shall
rejoice. My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld me. But those who vainly sought
my life will go down to the deepest parts of the earth, they will be delivered to the
power of the sword, they will be portions for foxes. But the king will rejoice in God, and
all who swear by him will be praised; for the mouths of those who speak iniquities have

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day,
and by night also before you. Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to
my supplication. For my soul was filled with evils, and my life drew near to Hell. I was
reckoned among those that go down to the Pit; I became as one that has no help, free among
the dead. Like the slain that sleep in the tomb, whom you remembered no more; and they
were cut off from your power. They placed me in the lowest Pit; in darkness and in the
shadow of death. Your wrath lay heavy upon me, and you brought all your waves against me.
You put my friends far from me, and made me an abomination to them. I was handed over and
I came out; my eyes grew weak because of my beggary. I cried to you, Lord, all the day; I
stretched out my hands towards you. Will you work wonders for the dead; or will physicians
raise them up again to praise you? Will any declare your mercy in the tomb, or your truth
in the place of destruction? Will your wonders be known in the dark, or your justice in a
land that has been forgotten? But to you, Lord, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer
will come before you. Why have you rejected my soul, Lord; why do you turn away your face
from me? I am poor and in toils since my youth; exalted, I was humbled and brought to
despair. Your fierce anger overwhelmed me, and your terrors appalled me. They surrounded
me like water all day long; they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour
you have put far from me, and my companions because of my misery.</font></p>

<p>The priest comes from the Altar and reads the morning prayers quietly.</p>

<p>Psalm 102<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is
within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of his
benefits. He forgives all your iniquities; he heals all your diseases; he redeems your
life from corruption and crowns you with mercy and compassion; he satisfies your desire
with good things; your youth will be renewed like an eagle&#146;s. The Lord performs deeds
of mercy and judgement for all who are oppressed. He made known his ways to Moses, his
wishes to the children of Israel. The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering
and full of mercy. He will not always be wrathful, nor will he be enraged for ever. He has
not dealt with us according to our iniquities, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For,
like the height of heaven above the earth, the Lord has made his mercy prevail over those
that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he taken our sins from us.
As a father takes pity on his children the Lord has taken pity on those who fear him. For
he knows of what we are made; has remembered that we are but dust. As for man, his days
are but as grass, he will blossom like a flower of the field; for when a wind has passed
over it, it will be no more and will know its place no longer. But the mercy of the Lord
is for ever and ever upon those who fear him; and his justice upon their children&#146;s
children, upon those who keep his covenant and remember his commandments to do them. The
Lord has prepared his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Bless the Lord, all
you his Angels, powerful in strength, who perform his word, and listen to the voice of his
words. Bless the Lord, all you his Powers, his Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord,
all you his works. In every place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul!</font></p>

servant: for in your sight no one living can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul,
humbled my life to the ground. Made me dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My
spirit grew despondent within me and my heart within me was troubled. I remembered days of
old, I meditated on all your works: I made the works of your hands my meditation. I
stretched out my hands towards you: my soul thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear
me swiftly, O Lord, my spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be
like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have
hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I should walk, for to you I have lifted up
my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord: I have run to you for shelter. Teach me to do
your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land. For your

<p>The Lord said to his disciples, &#145;Now the Son of man has been glorified, and God
has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in
himself, and he will glorify him at once. Children I am with you for a little while. You
will look for me, and as I said to the Jews &#145;Where I am going you cannot come&#146;,
so now I say it to you. I give you a new commandment that you love one another. By this
all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.&#146; Simon
Peter says to him, &#145;Lord, where are you going?&#146; Jesus answered him, &#145;Where
I am going you cannot follow me now, but later you will follow me.&#146; Peter says to
him, &#145;Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.&#146;
Jesus answered him, &#145;You will lay down your life for me? Amen, amen I say to you, a
cock will not crow before you have denied me three times. Do not let your hearts be
troubled. Believe in God and believe also in me. In my Father&#146;s house there are many
dwelling places. If not, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you. And
if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to myself, so that
where I am, you may be also. And where I am going, you know, and the way you know.&#146;
Thomas says to him, &#145;Lord, we do not know where you are going. How then can we know
the way?&#146; Jesus says to him, &#145;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one
comes to the Father except through me. If you had known me, you would have known my Father
also. And from now on you know him and have seen him.&#146; Philip says to him,
&#145;Lord, show us the Father and that is enough for us.&#146; Jesus says to him, &#145;I
have been with you for so long a time, and do you still not know me, Philip? One who has
seen me, has seen Father. How can you say, &#145;Show us the Father&#146;? Do you not
believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you I
do not speak on my own. The Father who abides in me, he does the works. Believe me, I am
in the Father and the Father is in me. If not, believe me because of the works themselves.
Amen, amen I say to you, one who believes in me will also do the works that I do, and
greater than these they will do, because I am going to my Father, and what ever you ask in
my name I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the son. If you ask anything in
my name, I will do it. If you love me, keep my commandments, and I will ask the Father and
he will give you another Paraclete to abide with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom
the world cannot accept, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him,
because he abides with you and will be in you. I will not leave as orphans. I am coming to
you. In a little while the world sees me no longer, but you see me, because I live and you
will live. On that day you will know that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in
you. One who has my commandments and keeps them, that is the one who loves me. One who
loves me will be loved by the Father, and I will love them and reveal myself to
them.&#146; Judas, not Iscariot, says to him, &#145;How is it that you are going to reveal
yourself to us and not to the world?&#146; Jesus answered and said to him, &#145;If anyone
loves me they will keep my word, and my Father will love them, and we will come to them
and make our dwelling with them. One who does not love me does not keep my words; and the
word which you are hearing is not mine, but that of the Father who sent me. I have said
these things to you while I abide with you. But the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit whom the
Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and remind you of all that I
have said to you. Peace I leave you, my peace I give you. I do not give as the world
gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled are play the coward. You heard that I said to
you, I am going away and I am coming to you. If you loved me you would rejoice that I
said, I am going to the Father. And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it
does happen you may believe; because the Father is greater than I. I will no longer speak
much with you. For the ruler of this world is coming and he has no claim on me. But the
world must know that I love the Father, and that as the Father has commanded me, so I do.
Rise up, let us go from here. I am the true vine and my Father is the vine dresser. Every
branch in me that does not bear fruit he removes, and every branch that bears fruit he
prunes, so that it bears more fruit. You are already pruned because of the word which I
have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself, unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the
vine, you are the branches. One who abides in me and I in them will bear much fruit,
because apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me they are thrown
out like the branch and wither, and they are collected, thrown onto the fire and burnt. If
you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish and it will be done for
you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples. As
the Father has loved me, so I have loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my
commandments, you will abide in my love, as I have kept my Father&#146;s commandments and
abide in his love. I have said these things to you that my joy may abide in you and that
your joy may be complete. This is my commandment: that you love one another, as I have
loved you. No one has greater love than this, that they lay down their life for their
friends. You are my friends, if you do what I command you. I no longer call you slaves,
because the slave does not know what his lord does. I have called you friends, because
everything that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did not choose
me, but I chose you, and set you, so that you might go and bear fruit and that your fruit
might abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he might give you. This is
what I command you: that you love one another. If the world hates you, know that it hated
me before you. If you had been of the world, the world would have loved what was its own.
But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this
the world hates you. Remember the word I spoke to you, &#145;the slave is not greater than
his lord&#146;. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they had kept
my word, they will keep yours. But they will do all these things to you because of my
name, because they do not know the one who sent me. If I had not come and told them these
things, they would have no sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin. One who hates
me also hates my Father. If I had not done the works among them that no one else has done,
they would have no sin. But now that have both seen and hated both me and my Father. But
in order that the word written in their law might be fulfilled, &#145;they hated me for
nothing&#146;. But when the Paraclete comes, whom I will send you from the Father, the
Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness concerning me. And you
also bear witness, because you are with from the beginning. I have said these things to so
that you may not stumble and fall away. They will expel you from the synagogues. But the
hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think they are offering worship to God.
And they will do these things to you because they have known neither the Father nor me.
But I have told you these things, so that when the hour comes you may remember that I told
you of them. I did not speak of these from the beginning, because I was with you. But now
I am going away to the one who sent me, and none of you is asking me where I am going away
to. But because I have told you these things, grief has filled your hearts. But I tell you
the truth; it is to your advantage that I go away. For unless I go, the Paraclete will not
come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes he will convict the
word concerning sin and righteousness and judgement. Concerning sin, because they do not
believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I am going away to the Father and you see
me no longer; concerning judgement, because the ruler of this world has already been
judged. I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when he
comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide into the whole truth. For he will not speak of
himself, but he speak of whatever he has heard and he will declare to what is coming. He
will glorify me, because he will take from what is mine and declare it to you. Everything
that the Father has is mine. That is why I said, &#145;he will take from what is mine and
declare it to you.&#146; A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while
and you will see me, because I am going away to the Father.&#146; The disciples therefore
said to one another, &#145;What is this that he is saying to us, &#145;A little while and
you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me,&#146; and &#145;because
I am going away to the Father&#146;?&#146; So they said, &#145;What is this &#145;little
while&#146; he speaks of? We do know what he is saying.&#146; Jesus knew that they wanted
to question him, so he said to them, &#145;Are you discussing what I said, &#145;a little
while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me&#146;? Amen,
amen I say to you, you will weep and lament, while the world will rejoice. You will
grieve, but your grief will become joy. A woman when she gives birth grieves because her
hour has come. But when the child is born, she no longer remembers her affliction because
of the her that a child has been born into the world. And so you now grieve; but I will
see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you. And on
that day you will not question me about anything. Amen, amen I say to you, whatever you
ask the Father in my name, he will give you. Until now you have not asked anything in my
name. Ask and you will receive that your joy may be complete. I have said these things to
you in riddles; but the hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in riddles, but
I will tell you clearly about the Father. On that day you ask in my name. And I am not
telling you that I will ask the Father for you, because the Father himself loves you,
because you have loved me and have believed that I came forth from the Father. I came
forth from the Father and came into the world. Again I am leaving the world and going to
the Father.&#146; His disciples said to him, &#145;See, now you are speaking clearly, and
not in riddles. Now we know that you know all things and have no need for anyone to
question you. Because of this we believe that you have come forth from God.&#146; Jesus
answered them, &#145;Now you believe. See, the hour is coming and has now come when each
of you will be scattered to his own home and you will lave me alone. And I am not alone,
because the Father is with me. I have said these things to you that you may have peace in
me. In the world you will have affliction; but take courage, I have conquered the
world.&#146; Jesus said these things and raised his eyes to heaven and said, &#145;Father,
the hour has come. Glorify your son, that your son may also glorify you, just as you gave
him authority over all flesh, that he might give eternal life to all that you had given
him. This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and the one whom you
sent, Jesus Christ. I have glorified you on earth, I have accomplished the work which you
gave me to do. And now glorify me yourself, Father, with you, with the glory that I had
with you before the world existed. I have revealed your name to those whom you have given
me from the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me, and they have kept your
word. Now they know that everything which you have given me is from you; because the words
which you had given me I have given to them, and they received them and truly came to know
that I had come forth from you, and they believed that it was you who sent me. I pray for
them; I do not pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, because they are
yours, and all that is mine is yours and what is yours is mine, and I have been glorified
in them. I am no longer in the world, and they are in the world, and I am coming to you.
Holy Father, keep in your name those you have given to me, that they may be one, as we
are. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name; those whom you had
given me I guarded, and not one of them has been destroyed except the son of destruction,
that the Scripture might be fulfilled. But now I am coming to you, and I say these things
in the world that they have my joy fulfilled in them. I have given them your word, and the
world hated them, because they are not from the world, just as I am not from the world. I
do not ask that you take them from the world, but that you keep them from the evil one.
They are not from the world, just as I am not from the world. Sanctify them in your truth;
your word is truth. Just as you sent me into the world, I too sent them into the world.
And I sanctify myself for them, that they too may be sanctified in truth. I do not ask for
them only, but also for those who have come to believe in me through their word, that all
may be one, just as you Father are in me and I in you, that they also may be one in us,
that the world may believe that you sent me. And I have given them the glory which you
have given me, that they may be one as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may
be perfected as one, and that the world may know that you sent me and loved them as you
loved me. Father, I wish that where I am those whom you gave me may also be with me, that
they may see my glory, which you have given me, because you loved me before the foundation
of the world. Righteous Father, the world does not know you, but I know you and they know
that you sent me. And I made known your name to them and I will make it known, that the
love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.&#146; When he had said this,
Jesus went out with his disciples across the brook Kedron, where there was a garden, which
he and his disciples entered.</font></p>

<p>At that time, Jesus went out with his disciples across the brook Kedron, where there
was a garden, which he and his disciples entered. Judas, his betrayer, also knew the
place, because Jesus had often gathered there with his disciples. So Judas, having got a
cohort and servants from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns and
torches and weapons. Jesus, knowing all that was coming upon him, went out and said to
them, &#145;Whom are you looking for?&#146; They answered him, &#145;Jesus the
Nazorean.&#146; Jesus says to them, &#145;I AM.&#146; Now Judas his betrayer was standing
with them. And when he said to them, &#145;I AM&#146;, they went back and fell to the
ground. So Jesus asked them again, &#145;Whom are you looking for?&#146; They said,
&#145;Jesus the Nazorean.&#146; Jesus answered, &#145;I told you the I AM. So if you are
looking for me, let these men go away.&#146; That the word which he had spoken might be
fulfilled, &#145;I have not lost any of those you have given me.&#146; Then Simon Peter,
who had a sword, drew it and struck the slave of the chief priest and cut off his right
ear. The slave&#146;s name was Malchos. Jesus said to Peter, &#145;Put your sword into its
scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup which my Father has given me?&#146; So the cohort and
the tribune and the servants of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him, and led him away to
Annas first. For he was Kaiaphas&#146; father in law, who was chief priest that year. It
was Kaiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was advantageous for one individual to die
for the people. Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. The disciple was
known to the chief priest and he entered the courtyard of the chief priest with Jesus.
While Peter stood at the door outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the chief
priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in. Then the girl who was
the doorkeeper said to Peter, &#145;You are not one of this man&#146;s disciples too, are
you?&#146; He says to her, &#145;I am not.&#146; The slaves and servants were standing at
a charcoal fire they had made, because it was cold, warming themselves. Peter was standing
with them and warming himself. So the chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples
and about his teaching. Jesus answered him, &#145;I have spoken freely to the world. I
always taught in the synagogue and the temple, where the Jews always assemble, and I have
said nothing in secret. Why are you questioning me? Question those who heard what I have
said to them. They know what I said.&#146; When he had said these things one of the
servants standing nearby gave Jesus a blow, saying, &#145;Is this how you answer the chief
priest?&#146; Jesus answered him, &#145;If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong. If
I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?&#146; Annas sent him bound to Kaiaphas the
chief priest. Now Simon Peter was standing warming himself. The servants therefore said to
him, &#145;You are not one of his disciples too are you?&#146; He denied it and said,
&#145;I am not.&#146; One of the chief priest&#146;s slaves, a relative of the one whose
ear Peter had cut off, says, &#145;Didn&#146;t I see you in the garden with him?&#146;
Again Peter denied it, and immediately a cock crew. So they led Jesus from Kaiaphas to the
praetorium. It was morning. And they did not go into the praetorium, so as not to be
defiled, so that they might eat the Passover. </font></p>

<p>At that time the soldiers who had seized him led him away to Kaiaphas the chief priest,
where the scribes and elders had assembled. While Peter was following him at a distance as
far as the courtyard of the high priest, and he went in and sat with the servants to see
the end. The chief priests and the elders and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false
testimony against Jesus, so that they might put him to death, but they found none. Though
many false witnesses came forward, they found none. Finally two false witnesses came
forward and said, &#145;This man said, &#145;I am able to destroy God&#146;s temple and
rebuild it in three days.&#146;&#146; The chief priest arose and said to him, &#145;Have
you no answer? What are these men testifying against you?&#146; But Jesus was silent. The
chief priest answered and said to him, &#145;I put you under oath before the living God to
tell us if you are the Christ, the son of God?&#146; Jesus says to him, &#145;It is you
who have said it. But I tell you all, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at
the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.&#146; Then the chief
priest rent his garments and said, &#145;He has blasphemed. What further need do we have
of witnesses? See, you have now heard his blasphemy. What is your verdict?&#146; They
answered and said, &#145;He deserves death.&#146; Then they spat in his face and hit him,
while others slapped him as they said, &#145;Prophesy, Christ: who it is that struck
you?&#146; But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to
him and said, &#145;You were with Jesus the Galilean too.&#146; But he denied it in front
of them all and said, &#145;I do not know what you are talking about.&#146; As he was
going out into the gatehouse another servant girl saw him and said to the people there,
&#145;This one too was with Jesus the Nazorean.&#146; And again he denied it with an oath,
&#145;I do not know the man.&#146; Shortly after the bystanders came up and said to Peter,
&#145;Truly you are one of them. For even your speech gives you away.&#146; Then he began
to call down curses and to swear, &#145;I do not know the man.&#146; And immediately a
cock crowed. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, &#145;Before a cock

<p>At that time, they lead Jesus from Kaiaphas to the praetorium. It was morning; and they
did not enter the praetorium in order not to be defiled, so that they might eat the
Passover. Pilate therefore went out to them and said, &#145;What charge are you bringing
against this man?&#146; They answered and said to him, &#145;If he were not an criminal we
would not have handed him over to you.&#146; So Pilate said to them, &#145;Take him
yourselves and judge him in accordance with your law.&#146; The Jews then said to him,
&#145;We are not allowed to execute anyone.&#146; So that the word of Jesus might be
fulfilled that he had spoken signifying by what sort of death he was going to die. So
Pilate went back again into the praetorium and summoned Jesus and said to him, &#145;Are
you the king of the Jews?&#146; Jesus answered him, &#145;Do you say this of your own
accord, or have others said it to you about me?&#146; Pilate answered, &#145;Am I a Jew
then? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you
done?&#146; Jesus answered, &#145;My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of
this world, my servants would be struggling to keep me from being handed over to the Jews.
But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.&#146; So Pilate said to him, &#145;Then you are
a king are you?&#146; Jesus answered, &#145;You say I am a king. For this I was born, and
for this I came into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the
truth listens to my voice.&#146; Pilate says to him, &#145;What is truth?&#146; And having
said this, he went out again to the Jews and says to them, &#145;I find no case against
him. But you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover. So do you want
me to release the king of the Jews?&#146; They all shouted again, &#145;Not this one; but
Barabbas!&#146; Now Barabbas was a thief. Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him. And the
soldiers plaited a crown of thorns and put in on his head, and they wrapped him a purple
cloak and said, &#145;Hail, king of the Jews!&#146; And they struck him repeatedly. So
Pilate went outside again and said to them, &#145;Look, I am bringing him out to you, so
that you may know that I find no guilt in him.&#146; So Jesus came outside wearing the
crown of thorns and the purple cloak. And he says to them, &#145;Behold, the man!&#146; So
when the chief priests and the servants saw him they shouted and said, &#145;Crucify,
crucify him!&#146; Pilate says to them, &#145;Take him yourselves and crucify him. For I
find no case against him.&#146; The Jews answered him, &#145;We have a law, and according
to that law he ought to die, because he made himself son of God.&#146; So when Pilate
heard this word he was even more afraid and he went into the praetorium and says to Jesus,
&#145;Where are you from?&#146; But Jesus gave him no answer. So Pilate says to him,
&#145;Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to crucify and
authority to release you?&#146; Jesus answered, &#145;You would have no authority over me,
if it had not been given from on high. Therefore the one who handed me over to you has the
greater sin.&#146; After this Pilate was striving to release him. But the Jews cried out
and said, &#145;If you release this man you are not Caesar&#146;s friend. Everyone who
makes himself a king opposes Caesar.&#146; So when Pilate heard this word he brought Jesus
out and took his seat on the tribunal, in the place called Stone Pavement, but in Hebrew
Gabbatha. It was the Preparation of the Passover, at about noon. And he says to the Jews,
&#145;Look, here is your king.&#146; But they shouted, &#145;Away with him, away with him!
Crucify him!&#146; Pilate says to them, &#145;Shall I crucify your king?&#146; The chief
priests answered, &#145;We have no king except Caesar.&#146; So he then handed him over to
them to be crucified.</font></p>

<p>At that time, Judas, seeing that Jesus had been condemned, repented and returned the
thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying, &#145;I have sinned by
betraying innocent blood.&#146; But they said, &#145;What is that to us? See to it
yourself.&#146; And flinging down the pieces of silver in the temple he went away and
hanged himself. But the chief priests picked up the pieces of silver and said, &#145;It is
not permitted to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.&#146; So
they conferred together and bought with them the potter&#146;s field as a burial place for
foreigners. And so that field has been called &#145;Field of Blood&#146; until today. Then
what had been said by the prophet Jeremy was fulfilled, when he said, &#145;And they took
the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one who was valued, whom they valued from
among the children of Israel, and gave them for the potter&#146;s field, as the Lord had
commanded me&#146;. But Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned him
saying, &#145;Are you the king of the Jews?&#146; Jesus said to him, &#145;You say
so.&#146; And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders he made no answer. Then
Pilate says to him, &#145;Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against
you?&#146; But he did not answer him with s single word, so that the governor was greatly
amazed. Now on the occasion of the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the
crowd one prisoner whom they wished. They had at the time a notorious prisoner called
Barabbas. So when they had assembled Pilate said to them, &#145;Whom do wish me to release
to you? Barabbas or Jesus called Christ?&#146; For he knew that they had handed him over
through envy. But while he was seated on the tribunal, his wife sent to him saying,
&#145;Have nothing to do with that just man. For I have suffered many things today in a
dream because of him.&#146; But the chief priests and elders had persuaded the crowds that
they should ask for Barabbas. Pilate says to them, &#145;So what shall I do with Jesus
called Christ?&#146; They say to him, &#145;Let him be crucified!&#146; The governor said,
&#145;Why, what evil has he done?&#146; But they shouted even louder, saying, &#145;Let
him be crucified!&#146; So Pilate, seeing that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was
starting instead, took water and washed his hands in full view of the crowd, saying,
&#145;I am innocent of the blood of this just man. You look to it.&#146; And the whole
people answered and said, &#145;His blood be on us and on our children.&#146; Then he
released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he had scourged and handed him over to be crucified.
Then the governor&#146;s soldiers took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered the whole
cohort round him. They stripped him and dressed him in a scarlet cloak, and having woven a
crown of thorns, they placed it on his head and a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt
in front of him and mocked him, saying, &#145;Hail, King of the Jews!&#146; They spat on
him and took the reed and struck it on his head. And when they had mocked him, they took
off the cloak and dressed him in his own clothes and led him away to crucify him. As they
went out they found a Cyrenian named Simon; they forced him to carry his cross.</font></p>

<p>At that time, the soldiers led Jesus into the courtyard, that is the praetorium, and
summoned the whole cohort. They clothed him in purple and having plaited a crown of thorns
placed it on him, and they began to salute him and say, &#145;Hail, king of the
Jews!&#146; And they kept striking his head with a reed and spitting on him, and they
bowed the knee and did him homage. And when they had mocked him they took off the purple
and dressed him in his own clothes and led him out to crucify him. And they forced Simon,
a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry
his cross. And they bring him to a place Golgotha, which means place of a skull. And they
gave him wine drugged with myrrh to drink. It was the third hour and they crucified him.
And the inscription of his charge ran, &#145;The King of the Jews.&#146; And with him they
crucified two thieves, one on the right and one on the left. And the scripture was
fulfilled which says, &#145;He was counted among transgressors&#146;. And the passers by
blasphemed him, shaking their heads and saying, &#145;Aha! You who would destroy the
temple and rebuild it in three days! Save yourself and come down from the cross.&#146;
Likewise the chief priests also mocked him among themselves with the scribes and said,

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">In your kingdom remember us, O Lord, when you
come in your kingdom. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</p>

<p>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</p>

<p>Through a tree Adam became an exile from Paradise; but through the tree of the Cross
the Thief made Paradise his home: for the former through tasting set aside his
Maker&#146;s commandment, while the latter, crucified with him, confessed the hidden God,
as he cried, &#145;Remember me in your kingdom&#146;.</p>

<p>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after justice, for they shall be filled.</p>

<p>The lawless bought the Maker of the Law from a disciple, and as a lawbreaker stood him
before Pilate&#146;s judgement seat, crying, &#145;Crucify&#146; the one who gave them
manna in the desert. While we, imitating the just Thief, cry with faith, &#145;Remember us
also, O Saviour, in your kingdom&#146;.</p>

<p>Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</p>

<p>The swarm of those who slew God, the lawless nation of the Jews, in their frenzy cried
out to Pilate, &#145;Crucify&#146; Christ, the innocent. They rather asked for Barabbas.
But we address to him the words of the grateful Thief, &#145;Remember us also, O Saviour,
in your kingdom&#146;.</p>

<p>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</p>

<p>Your life-bearing side, gushing up like a spring in Eden, gives drink to your Church, O
Christ, as a spiritual Paradise, from there dividing, as into four heads, into four
Gospels, it waters the World, making creation glad and faithfully teaching the nations to
worship your Kingdom.</p>

<p>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.</p>

<p>You were crucified for my sake, that for me you might be a source of forgiveness. You
were pierced in the side, that for me you might gush forth streams of life. You were
transfixed by nails, that I, assured of the height of your power by the depth of your
sufferings, might cry to you, O Christ, giver of life, &#145;Glory to your Cross, O
Saviour, glory to your Passion!</p>

<p>Blessed are those who are persecuted for justice&#146;s sake, for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven.</p>

<p>When you were crucified, O Christ, all creation saw and trembled. The foundations of
the earth quaked with fear of your might. The lamps of heaven hid themselves and the veil
of the Temple was rent. The mountains quailed, and rocks were split, and with us the
faithful Thief cries to you, O Saviour, &#145;Remember&#146;.</p>

<p>Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil
against you falsely for my sake.</p>

<p>On the Cross, Lord, you tore up our record, and numbered among the dead you bound the
tyrant there, delivering all from the bonds of death by your Resurrection, through which
we have been enlightened, O Lord who love humankind, and we cry to you, &#145;Remember us
also, Saviour, in your kingdom&#146;.</p>

<p>Rejoice and be glad, for great is your reward in heaven.</p>

<p>Lifted up on the Cross, destroying the power of death and as God wiping out the record
against us, O Lord, only Lover of humankind, grant the repentance of the Thief also to us
who worship in faith, Christ our God, and who cry to you, &#145;Remember us also, Saviour,
in your kingdom&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.</p>

<p>Let all of us believers pray with one accord to glorify worthily the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, a Unity of godhead existing in three Persons, remaining without
confusion, simple, undivided and unapproachable, through whom we are delivered from the
fire of eternal punishment.</p>

<p>At that time, the soldiers came to a place called Golgotha, which means &#145;place of
a skull&#146;, and they gave him vinegar to drink mixed with gall. And when he had tasted
it he would not drink. When they had crucified him they divided his garments, casting
lots, that saying by the prophet might be fulfilled, &#145;They divided my garments among
themselves, and cast lots for my raiment&#146;. Then they sat down and watched him there.
And over his head they placed his charge, which ran, &#145;This is Jesus, the king of the
Jews.&#146; Then they crucified with him two thieves, one on the right and one on the

scribes and elders and Pharisees, saying, &#145;He saved others; he cannot save himself.
If he is king of Israel, let him come down from the cross and we let us believe in him. He

of them ran quickly and taking a sponge filled it with vinegar, placed it on a reed and
gave it him to drink. But the rest said, &#145;Wait, let us see if Elias is coming to save
him.&#146; But Jesus, having cried out again with a loud voice, gave up the spirit. And
behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom, and the earth
was shaken and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints
who slept were raised, and coming out of their graves, after his rising they entered the

thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my
wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you alone I have sinned and done what is
evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words and win when you are judged.
For see, in wickedness I was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have
loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will
sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will wash me and I shall be made
whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been
humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out
from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your
salvation, and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your
ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from
bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips, and my
mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it.
You will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a
broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good
pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a
sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer

<p>At that time, there stood by the Cross of Jesus his mother and his mother&#146;s
sister, Mary wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalen. And Jesus, seeing his mother and the
disciple whom he loved standing beside him, says to his mother, &#145;Woman, behold your
son.&#146; Then he says to the disciple, &#145;Behold your mother.&#146; And from that
hour the disciple took her to his own home. After this Jesus, knowing that all things had
been accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled says, &#145;I thirst.&#146; Now
there was a vessel there full of vinegar; so having filled a sponge with vinegar and put
in on a branch of hyssop they held it to his mouth. So when Jesus had taken the vinegar he
said, &#145;It is accomplished&#146;, and bowing his head he gave up the spirit. The Jews
then, so that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the Sabbath, since it was
Friday, the day of Preparation (for that Sabbath was a solemn day), asked Pilate that they
might break their legs and that they might be removed. So the soldiers came and broke the
legs of the first and second who were crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus as
they saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs, but one of the soldiers
with a lance pierced his side, and at once there came out blood and water. And he saw it
has borne witness, and his witness is true. And he knows that he speaks the truth, so that
you too may believe. For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled,<i> </i>&#145;<i>Not
a bone of him</i> <i>will be broken</i>&#146;<i>. </i>And again another Scripture says,

<p>At that time Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but in secret for fear
of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate allowed
him. So he came and took the body away. Now Nikodemos, who had come to Jesus by night at
first, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds.
So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with sweet spices, as is the
custom of the Jews in burying. There was in the place where he had been crucified a
garden, and in it a new grave, in which no one had yet been laid. There, since it was
Friday, the day of Preparation for the Jews, because the grave was nearby, they laid
Jesus.</font></p>

<p>Impious and lawless people, why do you meditate vain things? Why have you condemned the
life of all to death? O great marvel! That the Creator of the world, who loves humankind,
is betrayed into the hand of transgressors and lifted up on a tree, that he may free the
prisoners in Hell. Long-suffering Lord, glory to you!</font></p>

<p>Today the blameless Virgin, when she saw you hanging on the Cross, with a mother&#146;s
love lamented, bitterly wounded in her heart, groaning in lamentation from the depth of
her soul, she struck her cheeks and tore her hair; and so beating her breast she cried out
with grief, &#145;Woe is me, my divine child! Woe is me, light of the world! Why have you
left my sight, Lamb of God?&#146; Therefore the armies of the Bodiless Powers were seized

bore you without seed, cried bitterly: My Son, where has the beauty of your form departed?
I cannot bear to see you unjustly crucified; hasten then, arise, that I too may see your

<p>On the next day, which is after the Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came
together to Pilate and said, &#145;Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was
still alive, &#145;After three days I will arise.&#146; Give orders then for the tomb to
be made secure until the third day, otherwise his disciples may come at night and steal
him and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. And the last deception will
be worse than the first.&#146; Pilate said, &#145;You have a watch. God, make it as secure
as you can.&#146; So they went with the watch and made the tomb secure by sealing the
stone.</font></p>
