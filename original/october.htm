<p>2. Of the holy Bishop Martyr Cyprian and the holy Virgin Martyr Justina.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua"><b>

<p>Justina </b>was from Damascus and had dedicated her virginity to Christ; <b>Cyprian</b>
came from Antioch in the region of Coele-Syria and Arabia and was given to magic and was a
worshipper of demons. He learned their impotence because having tried all his craft in
order to entice Justina to love, he was smitten by the sign of the Cross and acknowledged
the truth. He abandoned demonic error and came to Christ; he burned all his magic books,
was baptized and later succeeded to the episcopal throne of his native country. He was
arrested with Justina by the count of Damascus. They both endured numerous tortures at his
hands and were sent finally to Diocletian at Nikomedia, where their heads were cut off in
around the year 304.</font></p>

<p>3. Of the holy Bishop and Martyr Dionysios the Areopagite.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua">

<p>He was an Athenian, a learned man and one of the councillors of the famous court of the
Areopagos; hence he is called the Areopagite. He first believed in Christ in the year 50,
when Paul preached in Athens, of which he was appointed by him as its first bishop, in the
opinion of some people. Others, doubtless correctly, say that he was the second, and the
successor of Hierotheos, whom Dionysios calls his friend and teacher after Paul (<i>On the
Names of God,</i> 3.2). According to an ancient tradition he died a martyr in Athens in
around the year 96.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Apolytikion. Tone 4.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You were taught goodness and, sober in all things, you vested yourself in a good
conscience as befitted a priest. You drew ineffable mysteries from the Vessel of election,

with Christ God that our souls may be saved.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Kontakion. Tone 8. To you, my Champion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You passed through the gates of heaven, having become the disciple of the Apostle who
reached beyond the third heaven, Dionysios. You were enriched with complete knowledge of
ineffable mysteries and shed your rays on those who had previously slept in the darkness
of ignorance. And so we cry: Hail, universal Father.</p>

<p>4. Of our father among the Saints Hierotheos, bishop of Athens.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua">

<p>In the opinion of some he was also a member of the court of the Areopagus. When he had
been instructed in faith in Christ by Paul, he was ordained as bishop of Athens. It was he
again who initiated the godly Dionysios more completely into the truths concerning Christ.
Dionysios later explained his comprehensive and summary teachings more clearly and
exactly. He was brought by a cloud to the Dormition of the Mother of God, when he, after
the Apostles, was the initiator of the divine hymns. &#145;Wholly absent from, wholly
outside himself and experiencing communion in things that are celebrated in hymns, and
held to be by divine inspiration the hymnwriter of all that he had heard and seen, of
things known and unknown&#146; as Dionysios himself says (<i>On the Names of God, </i>3.2).
After a good and holy life he went to his rest in the Lord.</p>

<p>It is worth noticing here that in the sacred songs for the feast of the Dormition of
the Mother of God the hymnwriters have borrowed a great deal word for word from the above
chapter by Dionysios.</font></p>

<font face="Book Antiqua">

<p>She was from Antioch and lived around 284. At first she was a pagan and lived a

<p>Philip </b>was from Caesarea in Palestine and had seven daughters, who were
prophetesses. He preached in Samaria in 35. He met the eunuch of Candace, queen of the
Ethiopians, who was reading the prophet Isaias, and when he had instructed him he baptized
him. Later he preached among the Trallians in Asia, where he died.</p>
<b>

<p>Theophanes </b>was a Palestinian and brother of Theodore the branded. Both were monks
of the monastery of St Sabbas. They were called &#145;Branded&#146; because Theophilos,
the last of the iconoclast emperors, had inscribed on their foreheads with a red hot iron
thirteen lines of iambics and sent them into exile, where Theodore died, probably in 823.
Theophanes, however, who was born in 778, outlived the death of Theophilos in 842 and was
elected metropolitan of Nicea. He died on the 11th of October in 845. Both wrote numerous
Canons and Hymns, which adorn the services of the Church.</font></p>

fellow student under the same teacher. In about 743 he was consecrated bishop of Maiouma,
a coastal city of Palestine, which, having been formerly subject to Gaza, was known as the
harbour of the Gazeans. But under Constantine the Great it was completely rebuilt and
named Constantia, after his son Constantine (Sozomen, <i>History of the Church</i> 5.3).

he kept guard by the Cross. When he saw the earthquake and all that took place, he cried
out in fear: &#145;Truly this man was the son of God&#146; (Matt. 27:54). After the
Resurrection he abandoned his military career and returned to his native country of
Cappadocia, where he preached Christ. He was taken through the activity of Pilate for
Tiberius Caesar and beheaded.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua"><b>

<p>Andrew</b> came from the island of Crete, where he led the ascetic life. Under the
emperor Constantine Copronymous he left for Constantinople and there suffered much for the
honour of the holy icons. Finally as he was being dragged through the market place with
his feet bound, he was struck with a butcher&#146;s axe by a certain fishmonger, and so
gave up his spirit to God in the year 761. He holy remains were laid up in a place called
Krisis.</p>
<b>

<p>Osee</b> was from the tribe of Issachar, or rather that of Ruben, a son of Beiri, and
is first in order of the twelve Minor Prophets, and the oldest of them. He prophesied for
more than sixty nine years. He lived for more than eighty, between 810 and 720 BC. His
prophecy is divided into fourteen chapters.</font></p>

<p>18. Of the holy Apostle and Evangelist Luke.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>He was from Antioch, a doctor by profession, disciple and travelling companion of Paul,
at whose suggestion he wrote the Gospel that bears his name, after Matthew and Mark,
around the year 60 AD. Then he wrote the Acts of the Apostles, dedicating both books (in
the opinion of some people) to the governor or Achaia, Theohilos. He lived more than 80
years and died in Achaia, possibly at Patras, the metropolis of that province. The emblem
on his icon is the Ox, the third of the symbolic living creatures of Ezekiel [1,10],
because his Gospel starts from the worship under the old law, under which oxen were
frequently offered in sacrifice.</font></p>

<p>20. Of the holy great Martyr Artemios; and of our venerable and god-bearing father
Gerasimos the new ascetic of the island of Kephallenia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua"><b>

<p>Artemios</b> lived in the reign of Constantine the Great and was appointed by him as
governor of Alexandria. He was later honoured with the rank of Patrician. In the reign of
Julian the Apostate, who was punishing the Christians, in the year 361 Artemios with
outspoken boldness rebuked his apostasy. And so, after suffering many torments, his head
was cut off.</p>
<b>

<p>Gerasimos</b> was a Peloponnesian by birth, son of Demetrios and Kali, by whom he was
devoutly brought up and taught the sacred scriptures. He left his native country and after
journeying through various places, reached Kephallenia. There he restored an old church
and round it built a nunnery, which survives to this day, in a place called Omala. Here he
ended the ascetic course of his life in 1579. His holy relics, which have remained
incorrupt, are exposed to the faithful for their sanctification.</font></p>

<p>23. Of the holy Apostle James, the Lord&#146;s brother, first bishop of Jerusalem.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>According to some he was the son of Joseph the Betrothed, by the wife the latter had
before he was betrothed to the Ever-virgin. He was therefore known as her son and the
Lord&#146;s brother, just as He was considered to be Joseph&#146;s son (<i>Matt. 13:55</i>).
According to others he was Joseph&#146;s nephew, the son of Joseph&#146;s brother Cleopas
or Clopas, who was also called Alphaeus, and of his wife Mary, who was the sister, or
rather the first cousin, of the Mother of God. But he was again called the Lord&#146;s
brother because of this relationship, in accordance with the idiom of Holy Scripture.</p>

<p>By one of the Evangelists (<i>Mark 15.40</i>) he is therefore called &#145;James the
Less&#146;, to distinguish him from James the son of Zebedee, who is called &#145;the
Great&#146;. He was appointed the first bishop of Jerusalem in 34, having been chosen for
the episcopal throne, according to some, by the Lord himself; but according to Eusebius,
by the Apostles. He was nicknamed &#145;Olvias&#146;, that is to say &#145;just&#146;,
because of his outstanding holiness and justice. He climbed to the pinnacle of the temple,
that is to the highest point of its roof, on the day of Pascha to the amazement of all,
and from there he gave what they sought of him: a testimony concerning Jesus. He
proclaimed in a loud voice that Jesus is seated on the right hand of the Great Power, and
is going to come on the clouds of heaven. At this testimony many of those present shouted
out: &#145;Hosanna to the son of David!&#146;. But the scribes and Pharisees cried:
&#145;Ah! Even the Just has been led astray!&#146; and on the orders of the High Priest
Annanas he was cast down from there and then stoned as he prayed for his murderers. His
head was crushed with a fuller&#146;s board, and so he breathed his last in the year 62
(Eusebius, <i>History of the Church,</i> II.23). The first of the Catholic Epistles to the
Jews in the diaspora was written by this James.</font></p>

<p>The latter occurred at Constantinople in 741, the 24th year of the reign of Leo the
Isaurian, the first of the iconoclast emperors.</p>

<p>Saint <b>Demetrios </b>was from Thessaloniki, a most devout son of devout parents and a
teacher of Christ&#146;s faith. And so, when Maximianos came to Thessaloniki in 290,
Demetrios was arrested by him and kept chained in prison. Games were being held in the
city and Maximianos was present as a spectator. A certain barbarian, a friend of the
Emperor&#146;s and a noted wrestler, named Lyaios, outstanding both for his physical bulk
and his strength, was vaunting himself in the stadium and challenging the citizens to
wrestle with him. All those who took up the challenge he threw. Seeing this a certain
youth named Nestor, an acquaintance of Saint Demetrios, came to him in the prison and
asked for his blessing for single combat. This he received by being signed with the
precious Cross. Then he entered the stadium and cried boldly: &#145;O God of Demetrios,
help me!&#146; He got a hold on Lyaios and striking him a timely blow below the heart, he
left the former champion lifeless on the ground. Maximianos, greatly grieved at this, when
he learned the reason, ordered Demetrios to be run through at once with lances in the
prison where he was being held, but Nestor he slew with his own sword.</font></p>

<p>Mother of God Ever-Virgin, you have given your holy Protection, through which you

you to grant peace to your commonwealth, and to our souls God&#146;s great mercy.</font></p>

&#145;Glory, pure Virgin, to gifts of grace; glory to your virginity; glory to your
ineffable care for us, O Immaculate!&#146;</font></p>
