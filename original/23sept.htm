<p align="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">As godlike Zachary was serving as
priest and was within the most sacred temple and offering up the requests of the people to
the Benefactor and All-compassionate, he saw a godlike Angel, who cried out to him: Your
prayer and supplication have been heard. Courage, old man, and do not disbelieve me. For
you will have a child, a divine Forerunner, greater than all those born of women, who will
go before the Christ in the power of Elias.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Strange you appear to me in aspect and manner,
strange too in words and tidings, answered Zachary. For I have come to ask salvation for
the people, not to gain a child, as you announce. I find you quite the converse of my
requests and I suspect that you may not speak the truth; for how will what you say be
confirmed? The members of Elizabeth are deadened, and my own old age now counsels
disbelief.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Why do you not believe my words, Zachary, saying
that I bring good tidings that are false? I am God&#146;s Archangel. The things that I
have been ordered to, these I now tell as I stand here with you. But since you have
doubted and have not believed, you will be dumb and without speech, until you see the
divine outcome of my words. But when Elizabeth bears you a child, the voice of the Word,
the great Forerunner, your tongue will be clear and you will bless the God of Israel.</font></p>

sprouted, John the Forerunner. Wilderness rejoice, humanity dance; the herald of
repentance begins to take flesh in his mother&#146;s womb. Come rejoicing in his glorious

born of women; do not cease to intercede for those who with faith honour your divine

will not sing the praise of your child-birth without labour? For the only-begotten Son,
who shone from the Father beyond time, came forth from you, pure Maiden, ineffably

duality of persons, but known without confusion in a duality of natures. O honoured and

the Holy of Holies, a holy Angel stood by him, as it is written, and addressed him saying:

she will give birth for you, old man, to a son, John the Forerunner, lamp of Elias,
Prophet of the Most High and voice of the Word who dawned from a Virgin, Child of God.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Tell me quite plainly, how shall I know this? the
most blessed elder answered the Angel. For, as you see, I am full of years; Elizabeth is
barren. How then do you utter words to me beyond nature? I am amazed. Now I suspect that
you are not speaking the truth at all, my friend. Away with you, for I am beseeching the
salvation of the people, not to obtain a child, a thing hard to admit.</font></p>

voice of the Father from heaven bearing witness to his sonship; and you saw the Spirit in
