Lord spoke to Moses on the day on which he brought the children of Israel out of
the land of Egypt, saying, ‘Sanctify to me every first-born, first produced
that opens every womb among the children of Israel’. And Moses said to the
people, ‘Remember this day, on which you came out of Egypt, from the house of
slavery, for the Lord has brought you out from there with a mighty hand. And
keep his law. And it shall be that when the Lord God brings you into the land of
the Chananites, in the way that he swore to your fathers, you shall set apart
everything that opens the womb; the males to the Lord. But if after this your
son asks you, saying, “What is this?”, you will say to him, “God brought
us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery, with a mighty hand. And when Pharao
hardened his heart against sending us out, the Lord slew every first-born in the
land of Egypt, from the first-born of humans to the first-born of animals. This
is why I sacrifice everything that opens the womb; the males to the Lord, and
every first-born of my sons I will redeem”. And it will be for a sign upon
your hand, and immovable before your eyes, because thus said the Lord the
Almighty, “All the first-born of your sons you will give me. [<span style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Leviticus

who gives birth to a male child shall circumcise the flesh of its foreskin on
the eighth day. And for thirty three days he will not come into the sanctuary of
God to the Priest, until the days of purification are completed. And after this
he will offer an unblemished yearling lamb to the Lord for a holocaust, and a
young pigeon or turtle dove to the Priest at the door of the Tabernacle of
Witness. Or instead of these he will offer two young pigeons or two turtle
doves. And the Priest will make atonement for him. [<span style="color:red;

me as an offering out of all the children of Israel. And I have taken them and
sanctified them for myself in place of the first-born of the Egyptians, on the

burden,” said God the Most High, the Holy One of Israel.’<a style="mso-footnote-id:

the year that King Ozias died, I saw the Lord, seated on a high and exalted
throne. And the house was full of his glory. And Seraphim stood around him, the
one having six wings and the other having six wings, and with two they covered
their faces and with two the feet and with two they flew. And one cried to other
and they said, ‘Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord Sabaoth<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[4]</span></a>.
The whole earth is full of his glory.’ The threshold was lifted up at the
voice with which they cried, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said,
‘Woe is me! For I am pricked to the heart, because I, a human being, and with
unclean lips dwell among a people with unclean lips, and with my eyes I have
seen the King, the Lord Sabaoth.’ And one of the Seraphim was sent to me, and
in his hand he held a burning coal, which he had taken with tongs from the
altar. And touched my mouth and said, ‘See, this has touched your lips and it
will take away your iniquities and cleanse your sins.’ And I heard the voice
of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I send? And who will go to this people?’ And
I said, ‘See, here am I. Send me.’ And he said, ‘Go, and say to this
people, “You will hear and not understand, and seeing, you will see and not
perceive.” For the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard
with heavy ears and they have shut their eyes, lest perhaps they perceive with
their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn
back, and I will heal them.’ And I said, ‘Until when, Lord?’ And he said,
‘Until the cities are deserted from being inhabited and the houses from there
being no people, and the land will be abandoned as desert. And after this God
will remove the people far away, and those who are left behind will be
multiplied on the land’.<o:p>

and will come to Egypt and the idols of Egypt will be shaken at his presence and
their heart will be worsted within them. ‘And their spirit will be troubled
within them, and I will frustrate their counsel and hand Egypt over into the
hands of harsh lords,’ says the Lord Sabaoth. And the Egyptians will drink
water that is beside the sea, while the river will fail and be dried up. Thus
says the Lord, ‘Where now are your wise men? And let them declare to you and
let them say, “What has the Lord Sabaoth planned against Egypt?” On that day
the Egyptians will be like women, in fear and trembling in the presence of the
hand of the Lord Sabaoth, which he will bring against them. And there will be an
Altar to the Lord in the country of the Egyptians and a pillar to Lord at its
border. And it will be for a sign for ever to the Lord in the country of Egypt,
because they will cry to the Lord and he will send them a man who will save
them. And the Lord will be known to the Egyptians. And the Egyptians will know
the Lord in that day, and they will offer sacrifice and gift, and they will vow
vows to the Lord and pay them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference">[6]</span></a><o:p>

every mountain and hill made low; what is crooked will become straight, and the
rough ways will be made smooth; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God. Go
up onto a high mountain, you who bring good tidings to Sion; lift up your voice
with strength, you who bring good tidings to Jerusalem. Lift it up, do not be
afraid. I the Lord God, I, the God of Israel, will hearken and will not forsake
them; but I will open rivers from the mountains and springs in the middle of
plains. I will turn the wilderness into water meadows and the thirsty earth with
water courses. Let the heavens rejoice from on high and let the clouds rain
justice. Let the earth sprout and blossom with mercy and justice. Announce a
voice of gladness to the end of the earth and let this be heard: Say that the
Lord has delivered his servant Jacob. And if they thirst through deserts, he
will bring water for them from a rock. Rejoice you barren who have never given
birth, break out and shout, you who have never known birth pangs, for the
children of the deserted are more than those of her who has a husband.<o:p>

cast them headlong, and he will shake them from the foundations and they will be
utterly worsted in sorrow, and their memory shall perish. They shall come with
fear at the accounting of their sins, and their iniquities will convict them to
their face. Then the just will stand with much boldness in the face of those who
afflicted him and made his toils of no account. When they see this they will be
troubled with great fear and will be amazed at the wonder of his salvation. For
they will say as they repent and with anguish they will groan and say: Is this
he whom we fools once made a laughing stock and a byword of reproach? We
reckoned his life folly and his end dishonour. How has he been numbered among
the children of God and his lot with the Saints? Therefore we have erred from
the way of truth and the light of righteousness has not shone on us and the sun
has not dawned on us. We have been filled with paths of lawlessness and
destruction and journeyed through trackless paths, but have not known the way of

the mixing bowl: Whoever is foolish, let him turn to me. And to those who lack
wisdom she said: Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine that I have mixed for
you. Abandon folly, and you will live; and seek understanding that you may have
life, and set aright your understanding with knowledge. One who corrects the
wicked will gain dishonour for himself. One who rebukes the impious will get
blame for himself; for to the impious rebukes are blows. Do not rebuke the
wicked, lest they hate you. Rebuke a wise man and he will love you. Give
instruction to a wise man and he will be wiser; teach a just man and he will

Moses said, ‘I will turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not
being burned up.’ When the Lord saw that he drew near to see, the Lord called
to him out of the bush, ‘Moses, Moses!’ And he said, ‘What is it?’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then he said, ‘Do not come near; untie your shoes from your feet, for
the place on which you are standing is holy ground.’ And he said, ‘I am the
God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob.’ And Moses turned away his face, for he was afraid to look at God. Then
the Lord said to Moses, ‘I have seen the affliction of my people who are in
Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters; I know their
suffering, and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the
Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a
land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites,
the Amorites, the Pherizzites, the Gergesites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.<o:p>

a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes in the
Dispersion: Greeting. Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various
trials, for you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let
endurance have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in
nothing. If any of you lacks wisdom, let them ask God, who gives to all
generously and without reproaching, and it will be given them. But let them ask
in faith, doubting nothing, for one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is
driven and tossed by the wind. For that person must not suppose that someone
double-minded, unstable in all their ways, will receive anything from the Lord.
Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, and the rich in his humiliation,
because like the flower of the grass he will pass away. For the sun rises with
its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty
perishes. So will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits. Blessed
is the one who endures trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the
crown of life which God has promised to those who love him.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Beloved,
let no one say when they are tempted, ‘I am tempted by God’; for God cannot
be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one; but each person is tempted
when they are lured and enticed by their own desire. Then desire when it has
conceived gives birth to sin; and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death.
Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Every
good gift and every perfect gift is from on high, coming down from the Father of
lights with whom there is no variation or shadow of change. Of his own will he
brought us forth by the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits
of his creatures. Know this, my beloved brethren. Let everyone be quick to hear,
slow to speak, slow to anger, for a person’s anger does not work the justice
of God. Therefore put away all filthiness and rank growth of wickedness and
receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. But
be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if any one
is a hearer of the word and not a doer, they are like a person who observes
their natural face in a mirror; for he observes himself and goes away and at
once forgets what he was like. But those who look into the perfect law, the law
of liberty, and persevere, not being hearer that forget but doers that act,
shall be blessed in their doing. If any one thinks they are religious, and does
not bridle their tongue but deceives their heart, their religion is vain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to
visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from
the world.<o:p>

hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For if someone with gold rings and in fine clothing comes into your
assembly, and pauper in shabby clothing also comes in, and you pay attention to
the one who wears the fine clothing and say, ‘Have a seat here, please,’
while you say to the pauper, ‘Stand there,’ or, ‘Sit at my feet,’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with
evil thoughts?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Listen, my beloved brethren. Has not God chosen those who are
poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has
promised to those who love him?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
you have dishonoured the poor person. Is it not the rich who oppress you, is it
not they who drag you into court?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is
it not they who blaspheme that honourable name which was invoked over you? <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If
you really fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, ‘You shall love
your neighbour as yourself,’ you do well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law
as transgressors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For whoever keeps
the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For he who said, ‘Do not commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Do not
kill.’ If you do not commit adultery but do kill, you have become a
transgressor of the law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So speak
and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

triumphs over judgement.</font></p>

    This reading is a selection from Exodus 12,51-13,16 together with 22,29 and
    passages from Leviticus 12 and Numbers 8. The reference to the purification
    of the mother in Leviticus is made to refer to the child. This may be
    influenced by Luke 2,22, which has ‘their’, not ‘her’, or, according
    to the Western text, ‘his’. The text in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
    Festal Menaion</i> is misleading, being from the Hebrew, not the Greek of
    the Menaion, which differs noticeably from the LXX.<o:p>

    This last clause is not from any of the texts used in the reading. The
    phrase ‘God the Most High’ only occurs at Gen. 14,20 and Psalm 77,35.
    The second is characteristic of Isaias, and the two nearest references are
    30,12 &amp; 15. But the whole clause is probably a mere commonplace by the
    compiler.<o:p>

    ‘Sabaoth’ is treated as a divine name by the Fathers, being one of the

    Note in the Greek Menaion. ‘Instead of the above reading, the manuscripts
    have another from the prophecy of Ezekiel 43 &amp; 44 [i.e. the normal one
    for the Mother of God]. While what seems to be the oldest of the manuscripts
    has neither it, nor a Liti, nor Kathismata, but only the Aposticha with one
    Doxastikon in the same Tone, “A light for revelation of the nations”,
