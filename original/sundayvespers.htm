</font><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>After the Opening Psalm and the usual reading from the Psalter, at </font>
<font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4">Lord, I have cried</font><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">, 
we insert ten stichera: six of the Resurrection in the Tone of the week from the 
Octoichos, and the following four Prosomia from the Triodion.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Tone 6. Having set all your hope.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4">When you are about to 
come to execute just judgement, Judge most just, seated on the throne of your 
glory, a river of fire will draw all mortals amazed before your judgement-seat; 
the heavenly Powers will stand beside you, and humankind in fear will be judged 
according to the deeds that each has done. Then spare us, Christ, in your 
compassion, with faith we entreat you, and count us worthy of the destiny of the 
saved.</p>
<p>The books will be opened and the deeds of mortals will be revealed before the 
unbearable judgement-seat; and the whole valley will echo with the fearful sound 
of weeping, as it watches all those that sinned, weeping in vain, being sent 
away by your just judgement to everlasting torments. Therefore we beseech you, 
compassionate Lord: spare us who sing your praise, for you alone are full of 
mercy.</p>
<p>Trumpets will sound and tombs will be emptied, and all human nature in 
trembling will rise up. Those that have done good will rejoice in joy, as they 
wait to receive their reward; those that have sinned will tremble and bitterly 
lament, as they are sent to punishment and parted from the chosen. Take pity on 
us, Lord of glory, in your goodness, and count us worthy of a place with those 
who have loved you.</p>
<p>I weep and lament when I think of the eternal fire, the outer darkness and 
the nether world, the dread worm and the gnashing of teeth, and the unceasing 
anguish that will befall those who have sinned without measure, by their evil 
intent arousing you to anger, O Supremely Good. Of whom I am first, wretch that 
I am. But, Judge, in your mercy save me, for you love mankind.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. </font>

<p>When the thrones are set up and the books are opened, and God sits in 
judgement, O what fear there will be then ! When the angels stand with fear in 
your presence and the river of fire is flowing, what shall we humans, guilty of 
many sins, do then? When we hear him calling the blessed of his Father into the 
Kingdom, but sending sinners away to punishment, who will withstand that fearful 
condemnation? But, Saviour who alone love mankind, King of the ages, before the 
end comes turn me back through repentance and have mercy on me.</p>

<p>Alas, black soul! Till when will you not make an end of evils ? Till when 
will you lie in idleness? Why do you not think of the fearful hour of death? Why 
do you not tremble at the dread judgement seat of the Saviour? What defence then 
will you make, or what will you answer? Your works will be there to condemn you; 
your deeds will reproach you and condemn you. the time is near at hand, my soul; 
run, make haste before it is too late, and cry aloud in faith: I have sinned, 
Lord, I have sinned against you; but I know your compassion, Lover of mankind. 
Good Shepherd, do not deprive me of a place at your right hand in your great 
mercy.</p>
