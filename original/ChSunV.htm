<p>At </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, I have cried</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">, we insert ten Stichera: six of the

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Lord my Creator took me as dust from the earth, and with the breath of life he gave
me a soul and made me a living creature. He honoured me as ruler on earth over all things
visible and as a companion of the Angels. But Satan the deceiver, using the serpent as his
instrument, enticed me by food, separated me from the glory of God and gave me over to the
earth and to the lowest depths of death. But as Master and compassionate call me back
again.</p>

<p>Wretch that I am, I have cast off the robe woven by God, disobeying your divine
command, Lord, at the counsel of the enemy, and I am clothed now in fig leaves and in
garments of skin. I am condemned to eat the bread of toil in the sweat of my brow, and the
earth has been cursed so that it bears thorns and thistles for me. But, Lord, who in the
last times were made flesh of a Virgin, call me back and bring me into Paradise again.</p>

<p>O precious Paradise, unsurpassed beauty, tabernacle built by God, unending gladness and
delight, glory of the just, joy of prophets, and dwelling place of saints, with the sound
of your leaves implore to the Maker of all to open for me the gates which I closed by my
transgression, and may count me worthy to partake of the Tree of Life and of the joy in
which I delighted when I dwelt in you before</p>

<p>Adam was banished from Paradise through disobedience and cast out from delight,
beguiled by the words of a woman. Naked he sat opposite the place, lamenting &#145;Woe is
me!&#146; Therefore let us all make haste to accept the season of the Fast and obey the
traditions of the Gospel, that through them we may become well-pleasing to Christ and once
more receive Paradise as our dwelling.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Tone 6.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Adam sat opposite Paradise and, lamenting his nakedness, he wept, &#145;Woe is me ! By
evil deceit was I persuaded and robbed, and exiled far from glory. Woe is me ! Once naked
in my simplicity, now I am in want. But, Paradise, no longer shall I enjoy your delight;
no more shall I look upon the Lord my God and Maker, for I shall return to the earth
whence I was taken. Merciful and compassionate Lord, I cry to you, &#145;Have mercy on me
who am fallen&#146;.</p>

<p>Through eating Adam was cast out of Paradise. And so, as he sat in front of it, he
wept, lamenting with a pitiful voice and saying, &#145;Woe is me, what have I suffered,
wretch that I am! I transgressed one commandment of the Master, and now I am deprived of
every good thing. Most holy Paradise, planted because of me and shut because of Eve, pray
to him who made you and fashioned me, that once more I be filled with your flowers.&#146;
Then the Saviour said to him, &#145;I do not want the creature which I fashioned to
perish, but to be saved and come to knowledge of the truth, because the one who comes to
me I will in no way cast out.&#146;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Both now. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Theotokion.

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Christ the Lord, my Maker and Redeemer, came forth from your womb, all-pure Virgin, and
having clothed himself in me he freed Adam from the curse of old. Therefore with
never-silent voices we cry to you as true Mother of God and Virgin with the Angel&#146;s
salutation, &#145;Hail, Sovereign Lady, guardian and protection and salvation of our
souls&#146;.</p>
