<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 1. Tone 8. Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You fixed the sea, Lord, drowning
boastful Pharao with his chariots; you saved the people dry-shod and led them to the
mountain of sanctification, as they cried: Let us sing a song of victory to our God, the
mighty in wars.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Nations clap your hands, Hebrews lament, for Christ
the giver of life has torn asunder the chains of Hell, and raised the dead, and healed the
sick with a word. This is our God, who gives life to those who believe in his name.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You showed a wonder by changing water into wine, O
Master, who changed the rivers of Egypt into blood. And you raised the dead, perfecting
this second sign. Glory, O Saviour, to your counsel, glory to your abasement, through
which you have made us new.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O Lord, you are an ever-flowing stream of true life,
you are our resurrection; willingly you toiled, my Saviour; and as you wished you
thirsted, subject to nature&#146;s laws; and coming in the flesh to Sychar you sought
water to drink of the woman of Samaria.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Loaves you blessed, fish you multiplied, O God
beyond understanding; you satisfied the hunger of peoples without stinting and You
promised an ever-flowing spring of wisdom to the thirsty. You, Saviour, are our God, who
give life to those who believe in your name.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Three I glorify, alike without beginning and alike
in majesty: the Father, God without beginning, the Son alike without beginning and the
Spirit co-eternal with the Son: one Being in three Persons. I honour in hymns one first
Principle beyond beginning of a Godhead and Essence without beginning. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Both now<i>.</font><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> </i>Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You alone, pure Mother of God, contained your
creator in your womb and inexpressibly carried Him in the flesh, and you remained a
Virgin, your virginity quite unharmed; beseech him, your Son and God, always and without
ceasing on behalf of your flock.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 3. Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">My heart has been established in the Lord; my horn
has been exalted in my God; my mouth has been enlarged against my foes; I have been glad
in my salvation.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Do not judge according to appearance, O Jews, said
the Master, as he stood teaching in the temple, as it is written, at the mid-point of the
feast according to the law.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Do not judge according to appearance, O Jews; for
Christ has come, whom the Prophets declared would come from Sion, and call back the world.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">If you do not believe the words, O Jews, be
convinced by the Master&#146;s works: why do you err, rejecting the Holy One of whom Moses
wrote in the Law?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">If the Messias must surely come, O Jews, now that
Christ the Messias has come, why do you err, and reject the Just One, of whom Moses wrote
in the Law?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">We worship you, Father in Essence without beginning;
we hymn your Son alike without beginning, and devoutly praise the all-holy Spirit, as
Three, one God by nature.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Both now<i>.</font><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> </i>Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Being one of the Trinity, you were seen to have
become flesh without changing your Essence, Lord, or burning the incorrupt womb of her who
bore you, though you are wholly God and fire.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 4. Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Prophet Avvakum, O Lord, foresaw your coming
with the eyes of the mind, and therefore he cried out: God will come from Theman. Glory to
you, O Christ, glory to your condescension.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">If the Messias must come; but the Messias is Christ,
lawless ones, why do you not believe him? See, he has come and what he does bears witness:
he made water wine and braced the paralytic with a word.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Not understanding the Scriptures, you are all in
error, lawless Hebrews: for Christ has truly come and enlightened all, and among you he
has shown many signs and wonders; and vainly you deny true life.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">One work I showed you and you all marvel, cried
Christ to the Jews: you yourselves circumcise a man even on the Sabbath, he says: why then
do you attack me for raising a paralytic with a word?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">I have done many works, and for which work do you
stone me? Christ cried out, as he reproached the Jews. Was it because I made a man whole
with a word? Humans, do not judge by appearances.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O Christ, the offspring of the Father&#146;s nature,
working with the Spirit in the Apostles and resting in the Prophets, you have led all the
nations to knowledge of you through your signs.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory<i>.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Trinity undivided Unity, Father without beginning,
Son and Holy Spirit; Trinity in Unity; God, in honour the same, coequal in majesty,
life-giving, uncreated save those who hymn you, and deliver them from dangers and
troubles.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Both now<i>.</font><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> </i>Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">In your womb, Bride of God, pure Virgin-mother, you
contained God, yet he was not circumscribed. Do not cease to intercede for us, that we may
be delivered from troubles; for we ever flee to you for refuge.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 5. Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O Lord, our God, give us peace. O Lord, our God,
possess us. O Lord, we know no other but you, we name you by name.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">By wonders you made your Apostles shine, by marvels
you magnified your Disciples, glorifying them in all the world, our Saviour, and giving
them your kingdom.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">All the ends of the earth your Disciples enlightened
with wonders and teachings, as they proclaimed in divers ways, Christ Saviour, the word of
your kingdom.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">We give praise to your kingdom, we offer a hymn to
you who appeared on earth for our sake and enlightened the world and called back Adam.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory</font><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory to you, holy Father, God unbegotten; glory to
you, Word beyond time, only-begotten; glory to you divine Spirit, co-eternal and
consubstantial with the Father and the Son.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Your womb became a holy table, having the heavenly
bread, from which all who eat will not die, as he the nourisher of all has said, O Mother
of God.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 6. Irmos</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Like waves of the sea, O Lover of mankind, the waves
of life assail me; therefore like Jonas I cry to You, O Word: Bring my life up from
corruption, compassionate Lord.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O Jesu, who control the ends of the earth, you went
up and taught the crowds in the temple the word of truth at the mid-point of the feast, as
John declares.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You opened your lips, Master, and proclaimed to the
world the immaculate Father and the all-holy Spirit, keeping your identity of nature with
them even after the incarnation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You completed the Father&#146;s work, you confirmed
your words by works, O Saviour, performing cures and signs, making the Paralytic stand
upright, cleansing lepers and raising the dead.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Son without beginning became a beginning, taking
our nature he became man; and at the middle of the feast he taught, saying: Run to the
unfailing source to draw life.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">We all glorify one Godhead in Trinity, Being in
three Persons, uncreated, inseparable, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, as being three yet
one.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">As Virgin after childbirth we hymn you; as alone
Virgin and Mother we glorify you, pure Maiden, bride of God; for from you God was truly
incarnate, making us new.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 7. Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Chaldeans&#146; furnace, ablaze with flames, was
bedewed with spirit by God&#146;s authority, while the Children sang: Blessed is the God
of our fathers.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The repose of all, you toiled in the flesh; the
source of wonders, you thirsted willingly; you asked for water, Jesu, promising living
water.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You spoke, Lord, with a woman of Samaria, reproving
the folly of the lawless Hebrews; for she believed you to be Son of God, while they
denied.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Saviour, the ever-living spring, you promised to
give living water, welling up, water of incorruption, to those who receive in faith your
Spirit, who proceeds from the Father.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You nourished thousands of the hungry with five
loaves, O Saviour, and you made the remains of that fullness abound for other tens of
thousands, showing your glory to your sacred Disciples.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">He who eats your bread will live eternally, and he
who drinks your blood, O Saviour, abides in you, and you abide in him, and you will raise
him at the last instant.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You showed the marvel of your dispensation, Master,
confirming the divine authority by marvels: you expelled diseases, raised the dead, gave
sight to the blind as God.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You cleansed the lepers, made the lame walk, braced
the paralysed, healed the woman with an issue of blood; You walked on the sea, showing
your glory to your sacred Disciples.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory<i>.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O Lord, we worship your Father without beginning,
and the grace of the Spirit which, being God, you distributed to your Apostles and sent
them out to preach.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You contained in your womb the uncontainable Word,
you suckled at your breasts the nourisher of the world, you carried in your embrace the
maker of all, pure Mother of God.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 8. Irmos</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The one who is borne upon a throne of glory, and
unceasingly glorified as God, Angels and heavens bless, praise and highly exalt to all the
ages!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Come, peoples, see the one who is hymned upon a
throne of glory blasphemed by lawless peoples, and seeing, hymn the Messias who was
foretold by the prophets.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You are truly the Christ who is coming into the
world, from whom are salvation and forgiveness of ancestral faults; you are the true life
of those who believe in you.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Wisdom of God, so it is written, came to the
temple at the mid-point of the feast and taught; for he was truly the Messias, Christ,
from whom is salvation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">On the Sabbath, and on all days, Christ showed the
works of the signs, healing completely the sick from divers diseases; but the erring
people bore grudging anger.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">This man, it says, cured the Paralytic, who had been
lying sick for many years, on the Sabbath, and so transgressed the Law. Thus the Jews
bitterly reviled Christ.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Did not Moses, who gave you the law, not command you
to be circumcised? And he circumcised a man on the Sabbath, that the law of the fathers
might in no way be abolished, says Christ to the Jews.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The ever ungrateful, who of old dwelt in the desert,
enviously begrudged their benefactor, blaspheming, wagging their tongues and meditating
vain things</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory<i>.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Trinity is one God; the Father does not come to
sonship, nor the Son to procession, but separately and together light, I glorify God, the
three, to the ages.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Say how you gave birth to him who shone forth
eternally from the Father and is hymned with the holy Spirit? As he knows, who alone was
well-pleased to be born of you, O Mother of God.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Ode 9. Irmos</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Alien to mothers is virginity, and foreign to
virgins is child-bearing: in you Mother of God both are effected. Therefore all the tribes
of the earth unceasingly call you blest.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Troparia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">At the mid-point of the feast of the Jews you came,
my Saviour, to your temple, and you taught all: but the Jews marvelled, and said: Whence
does this man know letters, never having learned?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Pouring out gifts of healings, my Redeemer performed
signs and wonders, banishing diseases, healing the sick; but the Jews were maddened by the
multitude of his wonders.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">My Redeemer confounding the unbelieving Jews cried
out: Do not judge by appearances; but judge just judgement: for the Law orders every man
to be circumcised even on the Sabbath.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You granted your Disciples greater marvels, O
Saviour, as you had promised, when you sent them to proclaim your glory to the nations:
while they began to proclaim to the world your Resurrection, your grace and your
incarnation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">If you circumcise a man on the Sabbath, yet the law
is in no way violated; why do you upbraid me because I made a man whole with a word? You
judge according to the flesh, says Christ to the Jews.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O Word, who cured the withered hand with a word,
cure the long withered land of my heart, and make me fruitful, that I too, Saviour, may
produce fruits by fervent repentance.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Purify my leprous heart, O Word, and give light to
the eyes of my soul; stand me upright, who am lying on a bed of pain, as you raised the
Paralytic as he lay on his bed.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Glory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Alien it is to the lawless to honour the Trinity
without beginning, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the uncreated omnipotence, through which
the whole universe is established by the might of Its strength.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Both now<i>.</i> </font><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You contained within your womb, Virgin Mother, one
of the Trinity, Christ the Giver of life, whom all creation hymns, before whom tremble all
the thrones above; beseech him, all blessed one, that our souls may be saved.</font>
