SYMEON STYLITES</font></big></big></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><img src="SymStyl.gif" width="179" height="271"></font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua">INTRODUCTION</font></big></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The author of the Canon to Saint Symeon Stylites is
given in the Menaion as &#145;Monk John&#146;, the usual designation of Saint John of
Damascus in the service books.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The canon is of unusual interest since the writer
clearly had the life of saint written by Theodoret, bishop of Cyrrhus, in front of him as
well as at least one other source. I hope to trace these other sources and to update this
page shortly. For most of the canon he follows Theodoret closely, even to occasional
verbal citations. In the translation that follows I have given the relevant passages from
Theodoret after the troparion in a different typeface. My free translation is made from
the critical edition in the French Sources Chrétiennes [volume 257, pages 158-215] of the
Historia Philothea by Alice Leroy-Mohlingen in 1979.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Theodoret&#146;s account of Saint Symeon is of the
greatest importance, since he was personally acquainted with him and had visited him at
his pillar a number of times. He describes vividly an occasion when, after the saint had
told the crowds to ask for Theodoret&#146;s blessing, he was mobbed by the enthusiastic
pilgrims and only escaped being smothered by the saint&#146;s shouting to them to stand
back.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">THE CANON</font></big></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FF0000">The Acrostic,
without the Theotokia, is:</font><br>
Accept the hymn, O blessed Symeon.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000"><big>By Monk John</big><br>
<big>Ode 1. Tone 8. Let us sing to the Lord.</big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">As with the broken instrument of my tongue I weave this
song for you, God-bearing Symeon, grant me through your supplications divinely inspired
light of knowledge.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Persians, Ethiopians, Indians and Scythians and a
multitude of Arabs recognised your wisdom, Father, and they glorified Christ who is
glorified through you.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#0000FF">Persians, Medes and Ethiopians
  knew him, while his fame had reached the Scythians nomads and taught them of his love of
  toil and wisdom. [Life 1]</font><font color="#008000"> </font>A number of the manuscripts
  of Theodoret read here not &#145;Medes&#146;, but &#145;Indians&#146;. This Canon is not
  cited in the critical apparatus.</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You were filled with spiritual grace; for, like Jacob,
David and Moses, you appeared from the sheepfolds as leader of spiritual flocks, O blessed
one.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">He was first taught by his parents to
  shepherd the flocks, so that in this way he might be compared to the great men, the
  patriarch Jacob, chaste Joseph, Moses the lawgiver, David the king and Micheas the
  prophet. [Life 2]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000"><big>Theotokion</big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Immaculate Mother of God, hail honoured one, who
contained in your womb the uncontainable God, entreat that those who sing your praise you
may be redeemed.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 3. Plant your fear,
Lord.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Swiftly fleeing the icy blast of the winds, you boldly
reached a dwelling of salvation, Symeon, from which you plucked the fruit of life that
does not age.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">Once when there was heavy snow and the
  flocks were forced to stay inside, he profited from this break and went to the holy church
  with his parents. [Life 2]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Gladly you inclined your obedient ear to the Master who
promised blessedness; and blessed was the way of life you found.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">He said that he heard the voice of the
  Gospel calling those who weep and mourn blessed, but those who laugh wretched. [Life 2]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Having welcomed the seeds of the word in the furrows of
your heart, with floods of tears, you reaped for Christ a full ear of virtues.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">Having welcomed the seeds of God&#146;s
  word and hidden them well in the deep furrows of his soul, he hurried, so he told me, to
  the nearby shrine of the holy martyrs. [Life 3]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Bride of God, ineffably you conceived the Saviour and
Lord, who from troubles delivers us who call on you in truth.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 4. Lord, I have
heard.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">It was not on sand but on the deepest toils that you
laid the foundation of your ascetic life, All blessed one, and built an unshakeable tower
of virtues.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">He had the following vision in a dream.
  &#145;I seemed&#146;, he said, &#145;to be digging foundations. Then I heard someone
  standing there say that I must dig the trench still deeper. So, as he had ordered me, I
  increased the depth and again tried to take a break. But once more he commanded me to dig
  and not to relax my efforts. Having told me to do this three or four times, finally he
  said that the depth was sufficient and ordered me to build without toil, because the toil
  had ceased and the work of building would be without toil&#146;. [Life 3]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The roughest rope your body&#146;s lot to nail it to the
fear of the spirit, you found, O Venerable one, the allotment of a divine inheritance.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#0000FF">I heard from him and from the
  present superior of the same flock the story of how he once took a rope made of palm
  leaves &#151; it was extremely rough even the touch of the hands &#151; and strapped it
  round his waist, not putting it outside, but attaching to the skin itself. And he pulled
  it so tight that the part of his body to which it was attached became an open sore all the
  way round. [Life 5] </font>The reference to the &#145;divine inheritance&#146; is to Psalm
  15,6 &#145;The ropes [lines] have fallen for me in the best places, and my inheritance is
  the best&#146;.</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The hidden passions of the body ebbed away in rotting
decay, that even the worms feared you as you slept.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Imitating the life-giving Dead after his voluntary
passion, as in a tomb you placed yourself in a gloomy well.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">When he had reached the more deserted
  parts of the mountain, he found a dry cistern that was not too deep, got down into it and
  began to offer hymns to God. [Life 6]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Immaculate Mary, implore the God whom you bore to grant
your servants pardon of their offences.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 5. Enlighten us.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Christ showed you, Symeon, to be a new Daniel; for,
through a revelation, he brought you unharmed from a pit infested with wild beasts.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#0000FF">When the shepherds had showed them
  [his fellow monks] the cistern, they at once gave loud shouts, then, fetching a rope, they
  pulled him up, not without great difficulty, for going up is by no means as easy as going
  down. [Life 6]</font> In the Syriac life this has become a sinister cave, in which the
  devil torments the saint with visions of every kind of reptile and savage beast.</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Offering your whole self to the Lord, you bared yourself
to the hostile elements of snow, ice and heat.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You were shown to be a new Moses and a new Elias,
throughout your life living for the forty days on one meal, venerable Father.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">In his zeal constantly to increase his
  wealth of virtue, he wished, like those godlike men, Moses and Elias, to remain without
  food for forty days. [Life 7]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Ever implore your Son and our God, pure Mary who knew
not wedlock, to send down his mercy upon us the faithful.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 6. Grant me a tunic.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Blessed Father, Christ displayed you as a worker of
signs and wonders, having shown you to be a dwelling place of divine force.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">His reputation spread far and wide and
  it was only the people nearby but those who lived many days journey away who hastened to
  him. Some brought people who were paralysed, others asked help for the sick, others begged
  to become fathers, and what they could obtain naturally they sought to obtain through him.
  [Life 11]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Your body was raised on the column as on a cross;
therefore you have been glorified with Christ who was raised on a tree for your sake.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">Visitors came in ever increasing numbers
  and all tried to touch him and to pluck a blessing from his clothing of skins. To begin
  with he found this excess of honour misplaced, then, unable to stand the fatigue of the
  business, he had the idea of taking his stand on a pillar. [Life 12]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Having found a pathway in the air, inspired Symeon,
bring up to the heights of heaven those who faithfully sing your praise.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">To begin with he had it made six cubits
  high, then twelve, after this twenty two and now it is thirty six. For he longed to fly up
  to heaven and to abandon this earthly life. [Life 12]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">We the faithful declare you, Mother of God, to be the
temple and ark of God, living bridal chamber and gate of heaven.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 7. Youths who
honoured God.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You ended a drought for the despairing and opened for
them the gates of rain, you steadied the shaken land, and taught peoples to cry: Blessed
is the God of our fathers!</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Theodoret only speaks of Symeon&#146;s having prophesied
  a drought, but the Syriac life recounts his having ended one through his prayers.</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">As a mighty beacon of the Church and sun of many lights,
O Symeon, you sent out beams in all directions, enlightened peoples and taught them to
cry: Blessed is the God of our fathers!</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">His station on the pillar enlightened
  the Ishmaelites, enslaved by tens of thousands to the gloom of idolatry. For, placed as on
  a lampstand, this radiant lamp shed his rays on every side like the sun. [Life 13]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Streams flowing together from every side, a sea of men
welded together in the fold of your ascetic discipline, Servant of Christ, was taught by
you to cry out: Blessed is the God of our fathers!</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">As I said, one could see Iberians,
  Armenians ands Persians arriving and accepting holy Baptism. While Ishmaelites arriving in
  groups of three or four hundred at a time, sometimes even thousands, renounced their
  ancestral error with acclamation, smashed in front of that great beacon the idols that
  they had worshipped, abandoned the orgies of Aphrodite and taken part in the divine
  Mysteries. [Life 13]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Of old in the arms of the Elder, but now in the tables
of your heart, Venerable Symeon, Christ took his rest by his invisible power; therefore
you cried: Blessed is the God of our fathers!</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">It was fitting for him who took flesh without seed to
come forth from you, immaculate Virgin; for you, O Pure one, brought forth him who
surpasses all things, to whom with hymns we shout and cry: Blessed is the God of our
fathers!</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 8. The One glorified
in the holy mountain.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Having left every attachment and pitying a mother&#146;s
weakness, as though living, you appeared after death, crying out: Praise the Lord and
highly exalt him to all the ages.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You gave strength to a paralysed sick youth and ordered
him to carry the tribal chief like his bed on his shoulders as he praised the Lord and
highly exalted him to all the ages.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">On another occasion I saw a quite
  remarkable wonder. Someone, who was in fact a Saracen tribal chief, came and implored the
  saint to help a man who limbs had become paralysed during the journey. When the man had
  been brought before him, he ordered him to renounce the idolatry of his ancestors. When
  the man gladly obeyed and had done as he was ordered, the saint asked him if he believed
  in the Father, the Only-begotten Son and the Holy Spirit. When he had confessed that he
  believed, the saint said, &#145;Since you believe in these names, arise!' When he had
  arisen, he ordered him to carry the chieftain, who was a very large man, to his tent on
  his shoulders. He took him and departed, while everyone present uttered hymns of
  thanksgiving to God. [Life 16]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The One who made Job shine brightly through suffering, O
servant of Christ, turned you, when your flesh was suppurating with rottenness, into a
priceless pearl, as he glorified you, Symeon, to all the ages.</font></big></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><big><font color="#0000FF" face="Book Antiqua">They say that, as a result of his
  standing, a malignant ulcer developed on his left leg and that great quantities of pus
  oozed from it continually. [Life 23]</font></big></p>
</blockquote>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">At Symeon&#146;s entreaties, Master, you summoned a
boastful robber chief, as of old Thief on the Tree; therefore we praise you and highly
exalt you to all the ages.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Virgin Mother of God, who received the Angel&#146;s
&#145;Hail!&#146;, bore the Lord of glory and made the light dawn on the world, we all
hymn you and glorify you.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 9. The One revealed
on the mountain</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">As one who had shown himself a king through
steadfastness in sufferings, godly Symeon, Christ approved you as sharer of his royal
rule; therefore in hymns we magnify you.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Granted the grace of healing from the inexhaustible
treasury of the Spirit, godly Symeon, you reward with healings those who celebrate your
memory.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You walked the path of heavenly virtue, you displayed
the prize from on high, you have reached the heavenly dwellings: intercede that our souls
may be saved.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font>.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You were shown, O Virgin, to be the bush that burned yet
was not consumed by fire, by conceiving without seed the God and Saviour of the world,
whom we unceasingly magnify.</font></big></p>
