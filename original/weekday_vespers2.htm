merciful, accept me as I repent and give me power, O Saviour, to do your
statutes, for you alone are compassionate.</p>
<p>Come, Lord, and take me from the hands of the opponent, for I have been
willingly enslaved to the deceiver and have deserted your commandments, O
Compassionate. Give me time for repentance and bring me to the light of
compunction, that I may lament my fall, O Saviour.</p>
<p>Rescue my soul from hardness, Lord my God, and grant me showers of tears,
that I may wash away the shame of my iniquities. I am in darkness, make me

<p>Great is the power of your Angels, O Christ, for being bodiless they hasten
throughout the world, guarding the Churches with the strength that comes from
you, Master, and they make entreaty for the whole inhabited world.</p>
<p>You Powers, Virtues, Angels, Archangels, Seraphim and Thrones,
Principalities, Dominions and Cherubim of the ineffable glory and truly perfect

<p>Condemned, I have no boldness at all to gaze on heaven’s height, dragged
down by the multitude of my faults; so as the Publican I cry, ‘Have mercy on
me in my wretchedness, O Saviour’.</p>
<p>Great and fearful will be your coming, Master, when you take your seat and
pass just judgement. Do not judge me then as one condemned, but as God spare me

<p>Blessed Forerunner, do not cease to intercede for all the world, we all
beseech you; so that we, enriched with you as intercessor, may receive grace
from on high to trample down the head of the evil-intentioned.</p>

<p>Creation was changed at your Crucifixion, O Word; the sun withdrew its rays
in fear, the veil of the temple was rent and every believer was saved; therefore
we glorify your measureless riches.</p>
<p>He who is both God and Master assumed our flesh through pity, was nailed to
the Tree and lifted us up by being lifted up himself in body, as he was well
pleased, through the compassion of his mercy.</p>
<p>Drops of blood and water, which flowed from God, refashioned the world as
they poured from your side. With the water, as you are compassionate, you wash

grant that I may sing your praise with a pure heart, ask for grace and find
mercy on the day of judgement.</p>

<p>Lover of humankind, who are above all honour, you were reviled for our sake,
given vinegar to drink, and willingly endured the Cross, that by your death, O

the assaults of the foe; do not now despise my supplication, do not turn your
compassion from your servant, O Maiden, through your measureless compassion.</p>
<p>The one who deceived Adam in Eden into disobeying God, has ensnared me too,
turning me from the straight path, and has cast me into the pathless pit of many
