<p ALIGN="CENTER">Hail, of ascetics.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Alas for one who has enraged you, my merciful God and Lord! How many times
have I promised to repent, my Christ, and been found out a senseless liar.
Earlier I befouled my baptismal garment, the agreements I made with you I
disregarded; and yet again this second promise, which I confessed to you before
Angels and men, when I put on the habit of mourning, I have set at naught; but,
Saviour, do not at the end let me be destroyed.</p>
<p>Wretched soul, what defence do you have on the day of judgement? Or who will
rescue you from the sentence of eternal fire and all the torments? No one can
make the Compassionate have mercy, except you yourself by abandoning your
unlawful acts, by obtaining a way of life pleasing to God, by weeping each day
over your numberless falls, by which you stumble hour by hour in deed and word
and thought, by asking Christ to grant you for all these complete pardon.</p>
<p>O Saviour, do not let the compelling habit of sin master me; do not let the
demon, who makes constant war on me, lord it over me and bring me down to his
will; but snatch me from his mastery, and reigning in me, Lover of humankind,
count me worthy to become wholly yours and to live, O Word, according to your
will, to take my rest in you, and to find pardon and salvation and your great
mercy.</p>

<p>The corruption of the passions tyrannises over me and clouds the pupils of my
heart, and I have no strength at all to see the ways of salvation. As I advance
I go astray, Archangels, and I am hurled headlong into the deep pits of Hell.
But when I call to mind your wonders, I am cured of all my sickness. Oh that now
I could quickly see your kindness! Hasten to quench the flame of my passions,
all-honoured ones, guiding me to the light of salvation, and giving me release
from my evils.</p>
<p>The Evil One, who at first shone with you as the Morning Star, had the same
degree of glory as you, Chief Captains. But out of evil the opponent was borne
down to earth and became murky in darkness, and he was eager to dash me down
with him, I who had been honoured with the image of the Maker. Nevertheless,
though I fell headlong, Christ raised me up. Appear then for me in my
wretchedness as defenders and providers and wise protectors, asking also for his
great mercy.</p>
<p>I should have become in accordance with God’s image and been numbered with
you, and not, alas, bowed down entirely to the evil foe; but by the advice of
the boaster I did not rival you, I spurned the commandment and fell from the
honour of the Maker, O Archangels, and I am dragged down by slavery.
Nevertheless, seeing me wholly yielded to the passions, give me your hand to the
path which bears me upwards, as you beg that I may find salvation and the
ancient glory of my beauty.</p>

<p>Cool the muddy streams, good Jesu, hold back the torrents and grant my heart

conquered your foes, but now, as we grasp your Cross itself, we ask for help.
Give strength to your Church and grant to our Rulers, as to Constantine, the
trophy of victory through the multitude of your mercy, Lover of mankind.</p>
<p>Your Cross, Lord, though it appears by nature to be wood, yet it is clothed
with divine power, and while appearing physically to the world, spiritually it
works the wonder of our salvation. As we worship it, we glorify you, Saviour.
Have mercy on us.</p>

<p>Having despised all earthly things and bravely faced up to torments, you were
not disappointed of blessed hopes, but you have become heirs of the Kingdom of

<p>When I see your side pierced by a lance, my Son, I am wounded by the fearful
sword of grief, and I have been wholly unable to abandon the lament from my
soul, said the All-pure, as I stand in the presence of your suffering and watch
your unjust slaughter, O supremely good, long-suffering Lord. Where for me are
the good news, I cry amid my tears? Where is the one whose greeting to me was
‘Rejoice!’ Where the ineffable child-bearing? Where is your friend Peter?
But glory to your ineffable long-suffering.</p>

<p>Spare your servant, O Christ, when my soul is about to be parted from the
body at your command, who brought into one dust and spirit by divine decree.
When invisible enemies assail me with their assault and wickedness to tear me
fiercely asunder and make me their fodder, deliver me count me worthy to find
refreshment where sorrow and groaning have fled, where there is the torrent of
delight, the sound of those who feast and rejoicing.</p>
<p>Fearful of the final hour and the dread assault of the demons, from a soul in
agony, wretch that I am, I cry to you, ‘Smash their snares and stumbling
blocks, Lord and Master, and do not me, your servant, be a victim of their
perversity. See my dejection, attend to my affliction and free my wretched soul
from griefs, all-compassionate God, who great the world great mercy’.</p>
<p>Like the woman of Canaan, Saviour, I too cry out to you, ‘Cure my soul and
deliver it from the harm of demons and the assault of enemies who ever trouble
me unnaturally, destroy that which is according to your image, Lord, and draw
the judgement of my thought to senseless and blameworthy desires. Wipe them from
my heart, I pray, and plant in it your purest fear and grant that I may end my
life in peace in humility of soul.</p>

<p>Wearing the shield of faith and having roused themselves with the sign of the
Cross, your Saints, Lord, bravely submitted to tortures and destroyed the error
and arrogance of the devil. At their intercessions, as all-powerful God, send
down peace to the world and to our souls your great mercy.</p>
<p>Intercede for us, holy Martyrs, that we may be delivered from our iniquities;
for you have been given grace to intercede for us.</p>
<p>With insatiable force of soul, holy Martyrs, you did not deny but endured the
dread and diverse tortures of sufferings; you cast to the ground the arrogance
of tyrants; having kept the faith unwavering and unharmed, you passed over to
heaven; therefore as you have also won boldness, ask that we may be given his

<p>In the Red Sea was once depicted an image of the Bride who knew not wedlock.
There Moses was the parter of the water, here Gabriel the servant of the marvel;
then Israel marched dry shod through the deep, but now the Virgin has given
birth to Christ without seed; the sea after Israel's passage remained untrodden;
the Blameless one after bearing Emmanuel remained incorrupt. O God, who exists
and pre-exists, and appeared as man, have mercy on us.</p>
