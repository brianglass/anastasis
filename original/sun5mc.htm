who washes away the filth of those who hymn you with faith and highly exalt you to all the
ages.</p>

<p>We confess you, O Virgin, to be truly the divine and light-bearing throne, and tablet
of grace, for you received the Word of the Father; whom we highly exalt to all the ages.</font></p>

<p>Lord, though the grave was sealed by lawless men, you came from the tomb as you had
been born from the Mother of God; your bodiless Angels did not know how you had become
incarnate, the soldiers guarding you did not know when you arose; for both are sealed for
those who inquire, but the wonders have been revealed to those who with faith worship the
mystery which we hymn; give us joy and great mercy.</p>

<p>Lord, having smashed the eternal bars and burst bonds asunder, you rose from the tomb,
leaving your grave clothes behind as evidence of your true burial for three days; and you
went ahead into Galilee, while being guarded in a cave. Great is your mercy, O Saviour
beyond understanding; have mercy on us.</p>

<p>Lord, the women ran to your tomb to see you, the Christ who had suffered for our sakes,
and approaching they found an Angel seated on the stone, rolled back with fear, and he
cried out to them and said: The Lord has risen; tell his disciples that he has risen, he
who saves our souls.</p>

<p>Lord, as you came out of the sealed grave, so you came in to your disciples when the
doors were shut, and showed them your body&#146;s sufferings, which you had accepted, O
long-suffering Saviour; as sprung from David&#146;s seed you endured stripes; as Son of
God you have freed the world. Great is your mercy, O Saviour beyond understanding; have
mercy on us.</font></p>

<p>Lord, the King of the ages and Maker of all things, who for us accepted crucifixion and
burial in the flesh, that you might free us all from Hell, you are our God and we know no
other but you.</p>

<p>Lord, who will recount your dazzling wonders? Who will announce your dread mysteries?
For, incarnate for us, as you willed, you manifested the might of your power: for on your
Cross you opened Paradise to the Thief, and in your Burial you smashed the bars of Hell,
and at your Resurrection you made all things rich. Compassionate One, glory to you!</p>

<p>The Myrrhbearing women coming to your tomb very early in the morning sought to anoint
the Immortal Word and God; and informed by the words of the Angel they returned with joy
to tell the Apostles openly that you the life of all, have risen and grant the world
pardon and your great mercy.</p>

<p>The guards of the tomb which received God said to the Jews: O the folly of your plan!
In vain did you labour when you thought to guard the uncircumscribed. Openly you appeared
wishing to hide the Resurrection of the Crucified. O the folly of your assembly! Why do
you again wish to hide what cannot be hidden? Listen rather to us, and be willing to
believe the truth of the events. A dazzling Angel came down from heaven and rolled away
the stone; from fear of him we became as dead men; and calling out to the brave
Myrrhbearing women he said: Do you not see the death of the guards, the breaking of the
seals and the emptying of Hell? Why do you seek as a mortal the one who has destroyed
Hell&#146; victory and smashed death&#146;s sting? Go quickly proclaim to the Apostles the
good tidings of the Resurrection, crying fearlessly: He has risen indeed, the Lord who has
great mercy!</p>
