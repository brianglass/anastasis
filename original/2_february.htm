<p>The Lord spoke to Moses on the day on which he brought the children of Israel 
out of the land of Egypt, saying, ‘Sanctify to me every first-born, first 
produced that opens every womb among the children of Israel’. And Moses said to 
the people, ‘Remember this day, on which you came out of Egypt, from the house 
of slavery, for the Lord has brought you out from there with a mighty hand. And 
keep his law. And it shall be that when the Lord God brings you into the land of 
the Chananites, in the way that he swore to your fathers, you shall set apart 
everything that opens the womb; the males to the Lord. But if after this your 
son asks you, saying, ‘What is this?’, you will say to him, ‘God brought us out 
of Egypt, from the house of slavery, with a mighty hand. And when Pharao 
hardened his heart against sending us out, the Lord slew every first-born in the 
land of Egypt, from the first-born of humans to the first-born of animals. This 
is why I sacrifice everything that opens the womb; the males to the Lord, and 
every first-born of my sons I will redeem’. And it will be for a sign upon your 
hand, and immovable before your eyes, because thus said the Lord the Almighty, 
‘All the first-born of your sons you will give me. [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Leviticus 
12</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">] And it shall be that everyone who 
gives birth to a male child shall circumcise the flesh of its foreskin on the 
eighth day. And for thirty three days he will not come into the sanctuary of God 
to the Priest, until the days of purification are completed. And after this he 
will offer an unblemished yearling lamb to the Lord for a holocaust, and a young 
pigeon or turtle dove to the Priest at the door of the Tabernacle of Witness. Or 
instead of these he will offer two young pigeons or two turtle doves. And the 
Priest will make atonement for him. [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Numbers</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">] 
Because these have been offered to me as an offering out of all the children of 
Israel. And I have taken them and sanctified them for myself in place of the 
first-born of the Egyptians, on the day when I smote every first-born in the 
land of Egypt from human to beast of burden,’ said God the Most High, the Holy 
One of Israel.’</p>

<p>In the year that King Ozias died, I saw the Lord, seated on a high and 
exalted throne. And the house was full of his glory. And Seraphim stood around 
him, the one having six wings and the other having six wings, and with two they 
covered their faces and with two the feet and with two they flew. And one cried 
to other and they said, ‘Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord Sabaoth. The whole earth is full 
of his glory.’ The threshold was lifted up at the voice with which they cried, 
and the house was filled with smoke. And I said, ‘Woe is me! For I am pricked to 
the heart, because I, a human being, and with unclean lips dwell among a people 
with unclean lips, and with my eyes I have seen the King, the Lord Sabaoth.’ And 
one of the Seraphim was sent to me, and in his hand he held a burning coal, 
which he had taken with tongs from the altar. And touched my mouth and said, 
‘See, this has touched your lips and it will take away your iniquities and 
cleanse your sins.’ And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I 
send? And who will go to this people?’ And I said, ‘See, here am I. Send me.’ 
And he said, ‘Go, and say to this people, ‘You will hear and not understand, and 
seeing, you will see and not perceive.’ For the heart of this people has grown 
fat, and they have heard with heavy ears and they have shut their eyes, lest 
perhaps they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand 
with their heart and turn back, and I will heal them.’ And I said, ‘Until when, 
Lord?’ And he said, ‘Until the cities are deserted from being inhabited and the 
houses from there being no people, and the land will be abandoned as desert. And 
after this God will remove the people far away, and those who are left behind 
will be multiplied on the land’.</p>

<p>See, the Lord will be seated on a light cloud and will come to Egypt and the 
idols of Egypt will be shaken at his presence and their heart will be worsted 
within them. ‘And their spirit will be troubled within them, and I will 
frustrate their counsel and hand Egypt over into the hands of harsh lords,’ says 
the Lord Sabaoth. And the Egyptians will drink water that is beside the sea, 
while the river will fail and be dried up. Thus says the Lord, ‘Where now are 
your wise men? And let them declare to you and let them say, ‘What has the Lord 
Sabaoth planned against Egypt?’ On that day the Egyptians will be like women, in 
fear and trembling in the presence of the hand of the Lord Sabaoth, which he 
will bring against them. And there will be an Altar to the Lord in the country 
of the Egyptians and a pillar to Lord at its border. And it will be for a sign 
for ever to the Lord in the country of Egypt, because they will cry to the Lord 
and he will send them a man who will save them. And the Lord will be known to 
the Egyptians. And the Egyptians will know the Lord in that day, and they will 
offer sacrifice and gift, and they will vow vows to the Lord and pay them.</p>

a song pleasing to God, ‘Let us sing to the Lord, for he has been greatly

has come on unblemished arms into the temple as a babe. Therefore, believers,

glorified’.</p>
<p>Be strong, Symeon’s hands, weakened by old age. And you, an old man’s feeble 
legs, run straight to meet Christ. Forming a choir with the Bodiless Powers, let 
us sing to the Lord, for he has been greatly glorified.</p>
<p>You heavens, stretched out with understanding, rejoice. Earth be glad. For

<p>The First-born of the Father before the ages has appeared from an undefiled

<p>To set right again the first formed man, who through deception had become
