faith and making them resplendent by grace as you love mankind.</p>

<p>O Holy Martyrs, you became companions of the Angels, having bravely
proclaimed Christ in the stadium; for you abandoned all the world's pleasures as
unreal, but held to the faith as a sure anchor; therefore driving away error you
became a source of gifts of healings for the faithful, as you ceaselessly
intercede for our souls.</p>
<p>How should we not marvel at your struggles, holy Martyrs? for while enclosed
in the body you wounded bodiless foes; the threats of tyrants did not affright
you, nor the assaults of tortures crush you; truly worthily you have been
glorified in Christ's presence, and you ask for our souls his great mercy.</p>
<p>Precious is the death of your Saints, O Lord: for broken by sword, fire and
cold, they shed their blood, having their hope in you that they would receive
the reward of their labour. They endured and received from you, O Saviour, your
great mercy.</p>

<p>Through a tree Adam became an exile from Paradise, but through the tree of
the Cross the Thief dwelt in paradise; the one by tasting rejected the
commandment of his maker, the other, crucified with him, confessed the hidden
God, crying: Remember me in your kingdom.</p>
<p>O Holy Martyrs, fired with the love of Christ you quenched the fiery torch of
impiety with the dew of your struggles, and you appeared as lamps of the Church
with many lights, driving away by grace the darkness of the diseases and
tribulations of our souls; therefore as is fitting we all honour you.</p>
<p>Sacred High priests, the company of inspired Prophets, choirs of Ascetics and
the assembly of holy Women, served God and were glorified by virtuous deeds. Let
us call them blessed, as we implore that at their prayers we may reach eternal
glory and splendour.</p>
<p>Where your light shines, where choirs of Angels dwell, whence sighing and
grief have fled establish your servants who have died before us and left this
life of many sorrows, that they may hymn your ineffable goodness, O Saviour,
overlooking the offences which they committed.</p>
