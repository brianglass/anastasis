<p align="center"><strong><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5" color="#FF0000">INTRODUCTION</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Book Antiqua">The canon is by St John of Damascus, who borrows much
of his imagery from the Old and New Testaments. Some of the texts used, apart from the
account in Acts 1, are Psalm 23,7-10, Ezekiel 1,19, Ephesians 2,6, <i>He raised us up with
him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus</i>, Hebrews 1,3; 12,2,
Apocalypse 3,21. The opening troparion of the first Ode makes use of Psalm 17,11, <i>He
mounted on the Cherubim and he flew, he flew on the wings of the winds</i>,. The Fathers
explain that, just as the two Angels appeared in human form so that they would be visible
to the Apostles, so the Cherubim appeared in the form of a cloud to carry Christ to
heaven. As St John Chrysostom says, <i>For the Son a royal throne was sent, and not simply
a royal throne, but that of the Father himself. For Isaias says of the Father, 'See, the
Lord sits on a light cloud'. Since then the Father sits on a cloud, therefore he also sent
a cloud for the Son.</i></font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Book Antiqua">Throughout the canon St John stresses the fact that
by Christ's assumption in his humanity, <i>in the flesh</i>, our human nature has entered
and been glorified in heaven.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Book Antiqua">In Ode 7 the poet interprets the lost sheep of the
parable [Luke 15, 4-6] as an image of fallen human nature, an image which is also to be
found in the <i>Dogmatikon</i> in Tone 4. The same idea is found in St Gregory of Nyssa, <i>The
One who shepherds the whole rational creation, leaving behind the unerring and
supernatural flock in the heights, in his love for humanity goes in search of the erring
sheep (I mean our nature).</i></font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Book Antiqua">There are problems with the text of the canon and St
Nikodemos points out that five of the <i>Theotokia</i> and a number of troparia in some of
the Odes are not to be found in the manuscript <i>Pentecostaria.</i> There is evidence
elsewhere that <i>Theotokia </i>were often standard ones that fitted the melody of the <i>Irmos</i>
and were not specially written for particular canons.</font></strong></p>
