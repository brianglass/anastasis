<p>Lord, hear my prayer. In your truth give ear to my supplication, and in your justice
hear me. Do not enter into judgement with your servant, for in your sight no one living
can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul, humbled my life to the ground, made me
dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit within me was despondent, and my
heart was troubled within me. I remembered days of old, I meditated on all your works. On
the works of your hands I would meditate. I stretched out my hands towards you. For you my
soul was like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord; my spirit has failed. Do not turn
your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear of your
mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I should
walk, Lord, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord; I have
fled to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit
will guide me in an upright land. For your name&#146;s sake, O Lord, you will make me
live. In your justice, you will bring my soul out of affliction, slay my enemies in your
mercy and destroy all those that afflict my soul, for I am your servant.</font></p>

<p>After the ekphonesis the Bishop orders that the divine Liturgy take place in the Church
in which the sacred Relics had been placed. Then he raises them, with the Paten, on his
head and, with the Priests and Clerics going ahead with the holy Gospels and accompanied
by the people with lighted lamps, they are brought in procession to the Church that is
about to be dedicated, while the following troparia are chanted.</p>

<p>The Bishop leaves the Church, as do all the People, and no one remains inside except
for one cleric or lay person, who shuts the outer doors from inside. The Bishop processes
in a circle round the Church that is being dedicated while the following Idiomels are
sung.</p>

<p>For dedication to be honoured is an old law, and it is good; but rather should what is
new be honoured through dedication, for islands are dedicated to God, as Isaias says,
which are to be understood as the Churches from the nations, which have lately been
established and received stability fixed on God. Therefore let us too celebrate
spiritually the festival of the present Dedication.</p>

<p>B</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">rethren, the One who sanctifies and those
who are sanctified are all from One. For this reason he is not ashamed to call them
brethren, saying, &#145;I will proclaim your name to my brethren, in the midst of the
church I will praise you&#146;. And again, &#145;I will put my trust in him&#146;. And
again, &#145;Here am I, and children whom God has given me&#146;. Since, therefore, the
children share flesh and blood, he himself likewise shared the same things, so that
through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is the devil, and
free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. For it is clear
he did not take on himself the nature of Angels, but he took on that of the descendants of
Abraham. Therefore he had to become like his brethren in every respect, so that he might
be a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make atonement for the
sins of the people. For because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is able to
help those who are being tested.</p>

for worship and an earthly sanctuary. For a tent was constructed, the first one, in which
were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the Presence; this is called the Holy
Place. Behind the second curtain was a tent called the Holy of Holies. In it stood the
golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in
which there were a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron&#146;s rod that budded, and the
tablets of the covenant; above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat.
Of these things we cannot speak now in detail. Such preparations having been made, the
priests go continually into the first tent to carry out their ritual duties; but only the
high priest goes into the second, and he but once a year, and not without taking the blood
that he offers for himself and for the sins committed in ignorance by the people.</p>

<p>I will exalt you, my God, my King; and I will bless your name for ever and to age on

The Lord is great and highly to be praised, and there is no limit to his greatness.
Generation after generation will praise your works, and will declare your power. They will
tell of the majesty of the glory of your holiness, and will recount your wonders. They
will speak of the power of your dread deeds, and will recount your greatness. They will
proclaim the memory of the multitude of your goodness, and rejoice at your justice. The
Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy. The Lord is good to
all, and his acts of compassion are for all his works. May all your works confess you,
Lord, and all your holy ones bless you. They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, they
will tell of your power. To make known your power to the children of humankind, the glory
the majesty of your kingdom. Your kingdom is a kingdom for all the ages, and your dominion
for every generation. The Lord is faithful in all his words, and holy in all his works.
The Lord supports all who are falling, and sets upright all who are broken down. The eyes
of all hope in you, and you give them their food in due season. You open your hand, and
fill every living thing with your good pleasure. The Lord is just in all his ways, and
holy in all his works. The Lord is close to those who call on him, to all who call on him
in truth. He will do the will of those who fear him, and will hear their supplication and
save them. The Lord guards all who love him, and all sinners he will destroy. My mouth
will tell the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and to
age on age.</font></p>

placed in Beseleêl a spirit of wisdom and made them able to complete the Tabernacle of
Witness, in which were the ordinances of worship, the images and patterns of the truth. To
Solomon you granted breadth and largeness of heart and through him you raised up the
Temple of old. For your holy and all-praised Apostles you dedicated anew worship in Spirit
and the grace of the true Tabernacle, and through them you planted in all the world your
holy Churches and altars, O Lord of powers, for sacred sacrifices without shedding of
blood to be offered you. Now you have been well-pleased for this Church also to be built

do not profane your covenant because of our uncleanness, but disregard our offences, give
us strength and ability by the grace and visitation of your holy and life-giving Spirit,
to accomplish without condemnation the dedication of this Church and to effect the
consecration of the Altar within it, so that, blessing you in it with psalms and hymns and
spiritual liturgies, we may at all times magnify your compassion. Yes, Master, Lord, God
our Saviour, the hope of all the ends of the earth, hear us sinners as we entreat you, and
send down your all-holy, worshipful and all-powerful Spirit and sanctify this House. Fill
it with unending light; choose it for your dwelling; make it a tabernacle of your glory;
adorn it with your divine and supernatural gifts of grace; set it as a haven for the
storm-tossed, a place of healing for the passions, a refuge for the weak, a place that
puts demons to flight. Let your eyes be open to it by day and night and your ears
attentive to the supplication of those who enter it with fear of you and with devotion,
and who call upon your all-honoured and worshipful name. Whatever they ask of you, you
will hear in heaven above, show mercy and be gracious to them. Keep it unshaken until the
consummation of the age and declare the Altar within it to be a Holy of Holies by the
power and operation of your Holy Spirit. Glorify it more than the Mercy Seat under the
law, so that the sacred rites performed on it may reach your holy and spiritual altar
above the heavens and bring us the grace of your most pure overshadowing. For we take
courage, not in the work of our unworthy hands, but in your ineffable loving-kindness. </font></p>

nestlings; your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God. Blessed are those who dwell
in your house, they will praise you for ages of ages. Blessed the man whose help is from

set. For the lawgiver will give blessings; they will go from strength to strength, the God

O God our shield see; and look on the face of your Christ. For one day in your courts is
far better than thousands. I have chosen to be cast aside in the house of my God, rather
than to dwell in the tents of sinners. For the Lord God loves mercy and truth, he will

innocence. Lord God of hosts, blessed is the one who hopes in you.</font></p>

Bishop takes a jar full of vine-water or rose-water or white wine and pouring from it
three times, he washes the holy Table and wipes it with the antimensia, as he chants the

establish me with a sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners
will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from bloodshed, and my
tongue will rejoice at your righteousness. Lord, you will open my lips: and my mouth will
declare your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it; you will
not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a broken and
a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good pleasure; and
let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a sacrifice of
righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer calves upon your
altar.</font></p>

<p>and he makes three Crosses with it, one in the middle and two on either side. And
having handed back the vessel, with his hand he wipes the whole of the holy Table with the
three Crosses. He also makes Crosses with it on the column. While this is being done the
following is chanted.</p>

there the Lord has commanded the blessing: life for ever more.</font></p>

While this is being done the following Psalm is chanted.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Psalm 131</font></p>

the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.&#146; See, we heard of it in Ephratha, we
found it in the fields of the wood. We shall enter his tabernacles, we shall worship
towards the place where his feet have stood. Arise, Lord, into your rest, you and the ark

ones will rejoice. For David your servant&#146;s sake, do not turn away the face of your

of your womb I shall place on your throne. If your sons keep my covenant and these
testimonies of mine which I shall teach them, their sons too will sit on your throne for
ever. For the Lord has elected Sion, has chosen her as a dwelling for himself. &#145;This
is my resting-place to age on age. Here I shall dwell, for I have chosen her. Her door I

<p>After this he washes his hands in a new bucket or in the sacrarium, so that not one
single drop falls outside, and dries them with a new towel with great care and devotion.
He then takes the outer cover, or altar-cloth of the holy Table. While this is being put
on, the following Psalm is sung.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Psalm 92</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Lord is King, he has clothed himself with glory.<i> </i>The Lord has clothed and
girded himself with power. For he has established the world, which will not be shaken.
Your throne is prepared from of old; from eternity you are. The rivers lifted up, Lord,
the rivers lifted up their voices. The rivers will lift their poundings from the voices of
many waters. wondrous are the breakers of the sea; wondrous the Lord on high. Your

<p>After this the Bishop unfolds the Antimensia on the Table, placing them one on top of
another. Then he unfolds on them the antimension of the Church and places the sacred
Gospel on top of it. The Gospel and Altar are venerated with a kiss.</p>

<p>Then he censes the holy Table, the Sanctuary and the whole Church. While the Bishop is
censing, the following Psalm is said.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Psalm 25</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Judge me, Lord, for I have walked in my innocence; and since I hope in the Lord I will
not grow weak. Test me, O Lord, and try me; refine my inner parts and my heart with fire.
For your mercy is before my eyes; and I have been well pleased by your truth. I have not
sat with a gathering of folly, nor will I go in with the transgressors. I have hated the
assembly of evil doers, nor will I sit with the ungodly. I will wash my hands among the
innocent, and I will go around your altar, Lord, to hear the voice of your praise and tell
of all your wonderful works. Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house, and the place of
the dwelling of your glory. Do not destroy my soul with the ungodly, nor my life with men
of blood, in whose hands are iniquities; their right hand is filled with bribes. But I
have walked in my innocence; rescue me, Lord, and have mercy on me. My foot has stood in
uprightness; in the churches I will bless you, O Lord.</font></p>

<p>L</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">ord our God, Maker of heaven and earth, with
ineffable wisdom you founded your holy Church and established on earth the order of
Priesthood as an antitype of the angelic Ministry in heaven. Accept us now also, bountiful
Master, as we pray, not because we are worthy to ask for such great things, but that your
surpassing loving-kindness may be revealed. For you have never ceased to bestow your
bounties in countless ways upon the human race, but made the summit of your gifts the
Coming of your Only-begotten Son. He appeared on earth and made the light of salvation
shine for those in darkness, he offered himself as a sacrifice for us, and became the
whole world&#146;s expiation, making us sharers in his own resurrection. And, when he had
been taken up into heaven, he clothed his Disciples and Apostles, as he had promised, with
power from on high, which is the Holy Spirit, worshipful and all-powerful, who proceeds
from you, God and Father. Made powerful through the Holy Spirit in deed and word, they
handed on the baptism of filial adoption, raised up Churches, founded Altars, laid down
the rules and laws of Priesthood. Holding fast to their tradition, we sinners fall before
you, the eternal God, and we implore you, O Compassionate: Fill this House, which has been
built to sing your praise, with your glory, and declare this Altar here to be a Holy of
Holies, so that we, as we stand before it, as before the dread throne of your kingdom, may
worship you without condemnation, offering up supplications for ourselves and for all your
people and offering to your loving-kindness the sacrifice with out shedding of blood, for
pardon of sins voluntary and involuntary, guidance in life, establishment of a good way of
living, fulfilment of all justice.</font></p>

them, &#145;I have told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's
name, they bear witness to me; but you do not believe, because you do not belong to my
sheep. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give them
eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand. My
