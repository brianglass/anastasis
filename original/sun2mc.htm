<p>Everything that has breath and every creature glorifies you, O Lord, for through your
Cross you destroyed death to show the peoples your Resurrection from the dead, as you
alone love humankind.</p>

<p>Let the Jews say how the soldiers lost the King they were guarding. Why did the stone
not guard the rock of life? Either let them give up the one who was buried or praise him
risen, saying with us: Glory to the multitude of your mercies: Saviour, glory to you!.</p>

<p>Rejoice you peoples and be glad: An Angel sat upon the grave stone; he gave us good
tidings saying: Christ has risen from the dead and filled the universe with sweet
fragrance. Rejoice you peoples and be glad!</p>

<p>Before your conception, Lord, an Angel brought the greeting &#145;Hail&#146; to the one
full of grace: at your Resurrection an Angel rolled the stone from your glorious grave.
The one revealed the signs of joy instead of sorrow; the other instead of death proclaimed
to us a Master, giver of life. Therefore we cry to you, &#145;Benefactor of all humankind,
Lord, glory to you!&#146;</font></p>

<p>The women sprinkled sweet spices with their tears upon your grave, and their mouths
were filled with joy as they said, &#145;The Lord has risen!&#146;</p>

<p>Let nations and peoples praise Christ our God, who willingly endured the Cross for us
and spent three days in hell; and let them worship his Resurrection from the dead, through
which all the ends of the world have been filled with light.</p>

<p>You were crucified, you were buried, O Christ, as you willed; you despoiled death as
God and Master, granting the world eternal life and your great mercy.</p>

<p>In truth, lawless ones, by sealing the tomb you have granted us a greater marvel; the
guards have the knowledge; today he came from the grave, and they said: You said that
while we slept the Disciples came and stole him. And who steals a corpse, especially one
that is naked? But he has risen by his own authority as God, leaving behind his
grave-clothes in the tomb. Come, O Jews, see how he did not burst the seals the One who
trampled on death and grants the human race life without end and his great mercy.</p>
