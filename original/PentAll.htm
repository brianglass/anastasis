[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">11:16-17, 24-29</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>The Lord said to Moses: Gather to me seventy men of the elders of the people, whom you
know to be elders of the people, and their scribes; and you shall bring to the Tent of
Witness, and they shall stand there with you. And I shall come down and speak with you
there, and I shall take of the Spirit which is upon you and place it upon them, and they
shall bear the burden of the people with you, and you shall not bear them alone. And Moses
gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and stood them around the Tent. And the
Lord came down in a cloud and spoke to Moses, and he took of the Spirit which was upon him
and placed it upon the seventy men, the elders. But as the Spirit rested upon them, they
too prophesied in the camp, and then did so no longer. And two men had been left behind in
the camp; the name of one was Eldad and the name of the second was Modad, and the Spirit
rested upon them; and they were of those who had been listed, but they had not come to the
Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. And the youth ran and told Moses, and said to him:
Eldad and Modad are prophesying in the camp. And Jesus, son of Navi, who was Moses&#146;
assistant, his chosen one, said: My Lord Moses, stop them. And Moses said to him: Why, are
you jealous for me? And who would not give that all the Lord&#146;s people were prophets,
whenever the Lord should put his Spirit upon them?</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the Prophecy of Joel.<br>
[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">2:23-32</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: Children of Sion rejoice, and be glad in the Lord your God, because
he has given you food for justice; and he will send the early and the latter rain for you,
as before; and the threshing floors will be full of corn, and the presses overflowing with
wine and oil. And I shall repay you for the years that the locust has devoured, the
crawling locust, the consuming locust, the chewing locust and my great power which I sent
against you. And eating you shall eat and be filled, and praise the name of the Lord your
God, who has done wondrous things with you, and my people shall no longer be ashamed for
ever. And you shall know that I the Lord your God am in the midst of Israel, and there is
none beside me, and my people shall no longer be ashamed for ever. And it shall be after
these things that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your
daughters will prophesy and your elders will dream dreams and your youths see visions. And
upon my servants and my maid servants I shall pour out of my Spirit in those days, and
they will prophesy; and I shall show wonders in the heaven above and signs in the earth
beneath, blood and fire and the vapour of smoke; the sun will be transformed to darkness
and the moon to blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord comes; and it shall
be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.</p>

[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">36:24-28</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

lands and bring you into your own land; and I shall sprinkle pure water upon you, and you
will be purified from all your impurities and from all your idols, and I shall purify you;
and I shall give you a new heart and I shall give you a new spirit; and I shall take away
the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh; and I shall put my
spirit in you and make you walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgements and do
them; and you shall dwell on the land which I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my
people, and I shall be your God.</font></p>

<p>On the same day, the eighth Sunday from Pascha, we celebrate the holy Pentecost.</font></p>

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">With mighty wind, in form like tongues of fire<br>
Christ gives God&#146;s Spirit now to the Apostles.<br>
Spirit on this great day on fishers poured.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>This feast we also took from the Hebrew Bible; for just as they celebrate Pentecost,
honouring the number seven, and that when they had passed through fifty days from Pascha
they received the Law, so we too as we celebrate for fifty days after Pascha receive the
all-holy Spirit, who gives laws and guides into all truth and lays down what is pleasing
to God.</p>

<p>Note that there are three Feasts among the Hebrews, Pascha, Pentecost and Tabernacles.
They keep Pascha to commemorate the crossing of the Red Sea - for word Pascha means
&#145;crossing&#146;. While this same feast showed our crossing and ascent from the
darkness of sin towards Paradise.</p>

<p>They celebrated Pentecost in commemoration of their suffering in the wilderness, and
how they were brought through many afflictions in the land of promise, for then they
enjoyed fruit, corn and wine. And it showed our misery through unbelief and our entry into
the Church; for then we also receive communion of the Body and Blood of the Master. Some
say that this is the reason that Pentecost is celebrated by the Hebrews. Others however
say that it is honour of the fifty days that Moses fasted and received the Law written by
God. At the same time they commemorate the sacrifice to the calf and the other things
which Moses performed, ascending and descending the Mount. Differently it was thought that
Pentecost was observed by the Hebrews because of honour for the number seven, as has been
said; for this number multiplied by itself makes fifty days less one. The honour of the
Pentecostal fifty is not only in days but in years, from which was born the Jubilee among
them; for this happens when years are multiplied seven times. Then they leave the ground
unsown and give relief to animals and they allow bought slaves to leave.</p>

<p>The third feast is that of Tabernacles, celebrated after the harvest, that is to say
five months after Pascha. It was established to commemorate the day when Moses first fixed
the Tabernacle that had been revealed on Mount Sinai through a cloud and which had been
constructed by the master craftsman Beseleêl. For they would make tabernacles and
celebrate this feast, living in the fields and giving thanks to God, and they would bring
in the fruits of their own labours. And it seem that it was for this that David entitled
the Psalms For the wine vats. This was a type of our resurrection from the dead, when our
earthly tabernacles are dissolved and put together again and we shall enjoy the fruits of
our own labours and keep festival in eternal tabernacles.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that on this day, when Pentecost was completed, the Holy Spirit came
to dwell upon the Disciples. But since it seemed good to the holy Fathers to divide the
feasts, because of the greatness of the all-holy and life-giving Spirit, because the
Spirit is one of the holy Trinity, source of life, so we too will say tomorrow how the
holy Spirit came to dwell.</font></p>

<p>When the day of Pentecost had come, all the Apostles were together in one place. And
suddenly a sound came from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind, and it filled the whole
house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, divided and
resting on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to
speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them power of utterance. Now there were
dwelling in Jerusalem devout Jews from every nation under heaven. And at this sound the
multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in
their own language. And they were amazed and astonished, saying, &#145;Are not all these who
are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us in their own native language?
Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia,
Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene,
and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians, we hear them

came down in tongues of fire, as Luke, God&#146;s mouthpiece, declared. For he said: When

strange doctrines, strange teachings of the holy Trinity. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>The holy Spirit always was, and is, and will be, neither beginning nor coming to an

light and bestower of light; goodness itself and source of goodness; through whom the

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Immaculate, undefiled, without beginning, invisible, incomprehensible, unsearchable,
unchangeable, unsurpassable, immeasurable, long-suffering Lord, who alone possess
immortality and dwell in unapproachable light; who made the heaven, the earth and the sea
and all that was created in them; who grant to all their requests before they ask; we pray
and beseech you, Master who love mankind, the Father of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus
Christ, who for our sake and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate
from the Holy Spirit and Mary, the Ever-Virgin and glorious Mother of God.</p>

<p>Teaching us first by words and later also showing us by deeds, when he underwent the
saving Passion, he granted us, your humble, sinful and unworthy servants, an example to
offer supplications by the bending of neck and knees for our sins and those committed in
ignorance by the people. Do you, then, who are full of mercy and love for mankind, hear us
on whatever day we call upon you; but especially on this day of Pentecost, on which after
our Lord Jesus Christ had been taken up and been enthroned at your right hand, God and
Father, he sent down on his disciples and Apostles the holy Spirit, who settled on each
one of them and they were all filled with his inexhaustible grace and spoke in strange
tongues of your mighty works and prophesied.</p>

<p>Now therefore hear us as we pray, remember us, humble and condemned, and turn back the
captivity of our souls. Receive us as we fall before you and cry out, &#145;We have
sinned&#146;. On you we have been cast from the womb. From our mother&#146;s womb you are
our God. But because our days have wasted away in vanity, we have been stripped of your
help, we have been deprived of all defence. But confident of your compassion we cry,
&#145;Do not remember the sins of our youth and cleanse us of our secret faults. Do not
cast us aside in the time of old age. When our strength fails, do not abandon us. Before
we return to the earth, count us worthy to turn back to you and give heed to us with
kindness and grace. Measure our iniquities by your acts of compassion. Set against the
multitude of our offences the depth of your compassion. Look from your holy height, Lord,
upon your people here present and who await from you rich mercy. Visit us in your
goodness; deliver us from the oppression of the devil; make our lives safe with your holy
and sacred laws. Entrust your people to a faithful Angel guardian; gather us all into your
kingdom; give pardon to all who hope in you; forgive their sins and ours; purify us by the
operation of your holy Spirit; destroy all the wiles of the foe against us&#146;.</font></p>

<p><a NAME="Thur12June"></a>Lord Jesus Christ our God, who, while still present with us in
this life, gave your peace to humankind, and ever grant the gift of the all-holy Spirit to
the faithful as an inheritance which cannot be taken away, you sent down this grace today
in a more manifest form to your Disciples and Apostles and gave eloquence to their lips
with tongues of fire, through which we, every race of humankind, having received the
knowledge of God in our own language by the hearing of the ear, have been enlightened by
the light of the Spirit, delivered from the darkness of error and, by the distribution and
supernatural force of the perceptible tongues of fire, have been taught faith in you and
have been illumined to speak of you as God with the Father and the holy Spirit in one
Godhead, power and authority.</p>

<p>Do you, then, the radiance of the Father, the unchangeable and unalterable stamp of his
Essence and nature, the source of salvation and grace, open also the lips of me, a sinner,
and teach me how I should and for whom I ought to pray, for you know the multitude of my
sins, but your compassion will overcome their measureless number. For see, with fear I
stand before you, having cast away despair of my soul into the sea of your mercy. Govern
my life, by the ineffable power of your wisdom, you who govern all creation by a word, who
are the fair haven of the storm-tossed, and make known to me the way in which I shall
walk.</p>

<p>Grant to my thoughts the Spirit of your wisdom, to my folly the Spirit of
understanding, with the Spirit of your fear overshadow my deeds. Renew a right Spirit
within my inward parts and make firm the instability of my mind with the sovereign Spirit,
so that guided each day by your good Spirit to what is profitable, I may be found worthy
to do your commandments and always keep in mind your Coming, which searches out all that
we have done. Do not neglect me, so that I become deceived by the corrupted pleasures of
the world, but give me strength to yearn for the enjoyment of the treasures which are to
come. For you said, Master, that whatever someone asks in your name they receive without
restraint from your co-eternal God and Father. And so I a sinner at the coming of your
holy Spirit implore your goodness, &#145;The things that I have prayed for grant me for my
salvation&#146;. Yes, Lord, the loving and most generous giver of every benefaction, for
it is you who give superabundantly more than we ask. It is you who are compassionate,
merciful, who without sin became a partaker in our flesh and who in loving compassion bend
down to those who bend the knee to you and became the atonement for our sins. Give your
people, Lord, your acts of pity; hear us from your holy heaven; sanctify us by the power
of your saving right hand; shelter us in the shelter of your wings; do not despise the
works of your hands. Against you alone we have sinned, but it is you alone that we adore.
We do not know how to worship a strange god, nor to spread out our hands, Master, to
another god. Forgive us our offences and, accepting our supplications on our bended knees,
stretch out to us all a helping hand. Accept the prayer of all as acceptable incense,
rising up before your kingdom, above all goodness.</font></p>

everlasting bars and showed the way up to those who sat below. With a bait of divine
wisdom you hooked the author of evil, the dragon of the deep, bound him with cords of
darkness in Tartarus and secured him with the unquenchable fire and the exterior darkness
through your infinitely powerful strength. Glorious wisdom of the Father, who appeared to
those in distress as a mighty helper and enlightened those who sat in darkness and the
shadow of death, Lord of unending glory, beloved Son of the most high Father, eternal
light from eternal light, Sun of justice, hear us who entreat you and give rest to the
souls of your servants who have fallen asleep before us, our fathers, mothers and brethren
and the rest of our relatives according to the flesh and all our kinsfolk of the household
of the faith, whose memory we too now keep, because in you is the might of all things and
in your hand you hold all the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>Master almighty, God of our fathers and Lord of mercy, Creator of the mortal and
immortal race and of every human nature that is brought together and again dissolved, of
life and death, of our sojourn here and our translation there, you apportion times to the
living and establish the moments of death. You lead down to Hell and you lead up. You bind
with weakness and release with power. You dispose all things for our use and direct what
is to come for our advantage. You give life by hope of resurrection to those wounded by
the sting of Death. Master of all things, our God and Saviour, the hope of all the ends of
the earth and of those far off upon the sea, who on this final, great and saving day of
Pentecost revealed to us the mystery of the holy, consubstantial, co-eternal, undivided
and uncompounded Trinity and the coming and presence of your holy and life-giving Spirit
poured out in the form of tongues of fire on your holy Apostles, setting them as
Evangelists of our true faith, revealing them as confessors and heralds of true theology;
who have also been pleased on this most perfect and saving Feast to receive suppliant
prayers of atonement for those who are immured in Hell, granting us great hopes that
repose and comfort will be sent down from you to the departed from the pains which hold
them, hear us, lowly and wretched, who entreat you, and give rest to the souls of your
servants who have fallen asleep before us in a place of light, a place of green pasture, a
place of refreshment, from which all grief, sorrow and sighing have fled away, and
establish their spirits in the tents of the Just and count them worthy of peace and
repose. Because the dead will not praise you, O Lord, nor do those in Hell have the
freedom to offer you thanksgiving, but we the living bless you and implore you and bring
before you atoning prayers and sacrifices on behalf of their souls.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">And he adds this Prayer:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>God, great and eternal, holy and lover of humankind, who have counted us worthy to
stand at this hour before your unapproachable glory to hymn and praise your wonders, be
gracious to us, your unworthy servants. Grant us grace to offer you without conceit and
with a broken heart the thrice-holy hymn of glory and thanksgiving for your great gifts,
which you have made us and always do so.</p>

<p>Remember, Lord, our weakness and do not destroy us with our iniquities, but in our
humiliation show us your great mercy, so that fleeing the darkness of sin we may walk in
the daylight of justice; and having put on the weapons of light we may persevere
unassailed by any assault of the evil one, and that with boldness we may glorify you for
all things, the only true God and lover of humankind. For indeed, Master and Maker of all
things, truly great is your mystery: the temporary dissolution of your creatures and after
this their restoration and repose to the ages. We give thanks to you for all things, for
our entrances into this world and for our departures, which through your unfailing promise
betoken for us beforehand our hopes of resurrection and unending life. Would that we may
enjoy it at your future second Coming, for you are the author of our resurrection and the
impartial judge who loves humankind of what we have done in life, the Master and Lord of
our reward.</p>

<p>Through your supreme condescension you became a partaker with us in the same flesh and
blood and in those passions of ours that are blameless by willingly submitting to
temptation, and, possessing compassionate pity, having yourself suffered by being tempted,
and, as you promised, have yourself become a helper for us who are tempted, and so you
have also led us to dispassion. Accept therefore, Master, our supplications and
entreaties, and give rest to all the fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, and
children of each, and to every other kinsman and relative, and to all the souls who have
gone to their rest before us in the hope of resurrection to eternal life, and establish
their spirits and their names in the book of life and in the bosoms of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob and in the land of the living, for the kingdom of heaven, in the Paradise of
pleasure, through your shining Angels introducing them into your holy mansions. With them
raise our bodies also on the day which you have appointed in accordance with your holy and
unfailing promises. There is therefore no death for your servants, Lord, when we go out
from the body and come to you, O God, but a translation from sorrowful things to better
and more desirable, and rest and joy. But if we have in anything sinned against you, be
gracious to us and them, because no one is clean of defilement before you, though they
last but a day, except you alone, who appeared sinless upon earth, our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom we all hope to obtain mercy and forgiveness of sins. Therefore, as you are
good and love humankind, remit, forgive, pardon us our faults, voluntary and involuntary,
in knowledge and in ignorance, manifest and unnoticed, in deed, in thought, in word, of
all our actions and movements. Give freedom and respite to those who have gone before us
and bless all of us here present, granting a good and peaceful end to us and to all your
people, and opening to us the compassion of your mercy and love for humankind at your
dread and fearful Second Coming, and make us all worthy of your kingdom.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">He also adds this.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Great and most high God, who alone possess immortality and dwell in unapproachable
light, who made all creation with wisdom, who made a separation between the light and the
darkness and placed the sun to rule the day and the moon and the stars to rule the night,
who have counted us sinners worthy on this present day to come before your face with
thanksgiving and to offer you our evening worship. Direct our prayer, Lord, like incense
before you and accept it as a sweet fragrance. Grant us also that the present evening and
the coming night may be peaceful; clothe us with the weapons of light; deliver us from
every terror of the night and from every deed that operates in darkness, and give us
sleep, which you have given for the repose of our weakness, free from every diabolical
vision. Yes, Master of all things, giver of blessings, may we, being moved to compunction
on our beds, call to mind your all-holy Name in the night, and made radiant by the
meditation of your commandments may we rise up with joy of soul to give glory to your
loving-kindness, offering supplications and entreaties to your compassion for our sins and
those of all your people. Visit them in your mercy at the prayers of the holy Mother of
God.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Now the tongues have clearly become a sign to all: for the Jews, from whom came Christ
according to the flesh, have become sick through unbelief and fallen from divine grace,
and we from the nations have been counted worthy of the divine light, established by the
words of the Disciples, as they declaim the glory of God the benefactor of all things;
with them, as we bow our hearts with our knees, in faith let us worship, established by
the holy Spirit, the Saviour of our souls.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Create a clean heart in me, O God, and
renew a right spirit within me.</p>

<p>Now the Advocate Spirit has been poured out on all flesh: for beginning with the choir
of the Apostles, from them he has unfolded grace by participation to the faithful, and he
confirms his mighty descent distributing the tongues in the form of fire to the Disciples,
to the praise and glory of God. And so with hearts spiritually illumined and established
in faith in the holy Spirit, we entreat that our souls may be saved.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Do not cast me away from your
presence: and take not your holy Spirit from me.</p>

<p>Now the Apostles of Christ are clothed with might from above; for the Advocate, being
renewed in them, renews them with mystical newness of knowledge, which they proclaim in
strange voices and lofty words, teaching us to reverence the eternal, simple and
three-personned nature of the God of all things. And so enlightened by their doctrines,
let us worship the Father with the Son and the Spirit, imploring that our souls may be
saved.</p>

Godhead, whom we all worship as we say: Holy God, who created all things through the Son,
with the co-operation of the Holy Spirit. Holy Strong, through whom we have come to know
the Father, and through whom the Holy Spirit came into the world. Holy Immortal, the
