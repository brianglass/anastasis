<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Catechesis 60 contains a number of interesting
details. Who, for example, if the &#145;holy father and teacher&#146; referred to in the
opening sentence? If the Short Catecheses were given during St Theodore&#146;s exile to
the Propontis in 820, it cannot be St Platon, who had died in 812. The most likely person
is St Nikephoros, the Patriarch. The latter, despite certain earlier difficulties, had a
great respect for St Theodore. Cf. in particular <i>Life A</i> chap. 120 [PG 99:221-224].
The Patriarch called himself St Theodore&#146;s &#145;son&#146; [Letters II:79 &#151; PG
99:1317C], and St Theodore refers to himself as the Patriarch&#146;s &#145;child&#146;
[ibid. II:18. PG 99:1176A]. St Nikephoros had been deposed in 815 and was at this time
also in exile in his own monastery on the Propontis. That he should visit his friend St
Theodore and his monks is, to say the least, not improbable.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The reference to &#145;the story of the Flood&#146;
suggests that the readings at Vespers were the same in St Theodore&#146;s day as they are
today.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">In number 63 the reference to &#145;the ruler&#146;
in Bulgaria is almost certainly to Omurgat (813-831), whose father, Kroumos (802-814) had
carried off into captivity some 30,000 Christians some years before. If the Catecheses
were all given at the same time, they must be dated between 820 (the death of Metropolitan
Michael, the subject of Catechesis 21) and 826 (the death of St Theodore himself).</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Book Antiqua" size="6">CATECHESIS 60</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua" color="#0000FF">On our sudden departure from here and
teaching about keeping safe watch over our senses and our mind from unseemly desires.
Given on Wednesday of the 3rd Week.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Brethren and fathers, in the presence of our holy
father and teacher we have no need to discourse; but nevertheless because of our custom
let us say just a little. Day by day our life, as you see, is passing and we are getting
nearer to death, and we must remove hence and be joined to our brothers and fathers; so
that there is need of much vigilance and attention and preparation of heart. We hear the
story of the Flood being read, and the Lord in the Gospels saying: As in the days of Noë
they were eating, drinking, marrying, buying, selling and suddenly the flood came, so too
it will be at the coming of the Son of Man [</font><font size="4" face="ClassGarmnd BT">Cf
Mt 24,37-39, Lk 17,26s. St Theodore is quoting from memory</font><font face="ClassGarmnd BT" size="4">]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">. And perhaps we wonder
in this case how insensibly they were disposed, and were not rather trembling and
terrified. Let us be on the watch then lest we find ourselves without realising it in the
same state of which we accuse them. Already it is not the ark which is being got ready,
which was being filled up during one hundred years, but every day the tomb is seen filled,
into which we are about to crawl. Already each day death is at work [<font color="#0000FF">Cf. 2 Cor 4,12.</font>],
when each one of our brothers departs. Things here are more fearful than those there; and
so we should be on our guard. I don&#146;t say: we shouldn&#146;t eat, drink, or clothe
ourselves. I don&#146;t say that; <i>but whether we eat, or drink, or whatever we do, let
us do everything to the glory of God</i>, [<font color="#0000FF">1 Cor 10,31-32</font></font><font size="3" face="ClassGarmnd BT">.</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">] giving no offence to
Jews or Greeks or to the Church of God, as the Apostle teaches.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Yes, I exhort, yes, I implore, my brothers, <i>make
my joy complete</i>, as the Apostle again says, <i>be of the same mind, having the same
love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish ambition or vainglory;
but in humility think of others as better than yourselves </i>[<font color="#0000FF">Phil 2,2-3</font></font><font size="4" face="ClassGarmnd BT"><font color="#0000FF">.</font>]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">. Let us secure
our senses, sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, through them death enters. Let us bridle
our mind not to be carried off to things it should not, not to step into the pitfall of
unseemly things, not to picture to ourselves evil images nor to conceive sinful desires,
from which we gain no profit or pleasure; on the contrary we are pained and crushed
accomplishing nothing useful. There is one repose then and one pleasure, to cleanse the
soul and to look towards dispassion. And let us not grow despondent [<font color="#0000FF">The verb from
<i>akedia.</i></font>]
when called to repose and the joy of dispassion, but let us hasten and press forward
intently with diligence to right every defect; and God is our helper; for the Lord is near
those who wait for him. And by living thus may we reach the kingdom of heaven in Christ
Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory and might with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and
ever and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Book Antiqua" size="6">CATECHESIS 61</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua" color="#0000FF">That we must not submit ourselves in
temptations, and about fasting.<br>
Given on Friday of the 3rd Week.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Brethren and fathers, yesterday a tempest and to-day
calm; yesterday a &lt;disturbance&gt; [1]&nbsp; and today quiet; but blessed is God, who
has also dispelled the trial and given you power to remain unmoved in the expectation of
threats. This is the way of true Christians, this is the way of authentic monks, to hold
themselves always in readiness in the face of dangers on behalf of virtue and to consider
nothing more precious that the commandment of God. Those who came said what they said, and
they left not so much amazed as ashamed; while to you may the Lord grant the perfect
reward in return for your having chosen to be persecuted for his sake; and being rich in
mercy he knows how to crown from the intention alone the one who chooses the good. But in
fact the trial has not been dispelled, but again and again it continues, and particularly
because everywhere there are edicts of the rulers that no one is to lag behind from having
a share in heretical fellowship. And so let us hear the Apostle when he says, <i>Conduct
yourselves wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity. Let your speech be
always gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should respond to each
one </i>[<font color="#0000FF">Col 4,5-6.</font>]. By this he teaches us that we should not submit just anyhow
to trials, nor should we pass God&#146;s word over in silence, for he says, <i>My soul
takes no pleasure in anyone who draws back </i>[<font color="#0000FF">Heb 10,8 = Hab 2,4</font>]. But
that&#146;s enough of these matters.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Already the fast has advanced and lays on us,
brethren, the task of pressing on eagerly again and again to what follows as each has
chosen, not reluctantly or under constraint; <i>for God loves a cheerful</i> faster [<font color="#0000FF">1
Cor. 9,7. St Paul, of course, has &#145;giver&#146;</font>.]. Except that the coenobitic rule
does not let each one act according to their own will; but this is the common limit of
self-mastery for those living in obedience: the cutting of their own will. Fasting then is
good, because it tames the passions and subjects the flesh to the spirit; weeping is good,
because it wipes clean and washes the heart of sins and sets it pure before the Lord;
prayer is good, because it gives the mind wings and makes it a companion of God; love is
good, because it disregards what concerns itself for the advantage of the neighbour; zeal
is good, because it lightens toils and makes the spirit young, as it makes the elder young
again. Therefore let us become cheerful, let us be eager. The moment for psalmody? Let us
advance keenly. The moment for work? Let us work earnestly. The moment for stillness? Let
us be still reasonably. The time for talk? Let us talk suitably. And to speak simply,
doing <i>everything decently and in order</i>,[<font color="#0000FF">1 Cor. 14,40.</font>] as we have been
instructed; let us remain outside tumult and all idle chatter. Let the measure of
genuflexions be completed and the customary recitation be fulfilled, according to each
one&#146;s power, while watch is kept over the body&#146;s health. And would that the God
of peace might bring us to the queen of days, to the resurrection of Christ, and make us
worthy of the kingdom of heaven, where there is <i>no food and drink, but justice and
peace and joy</i>, as it is written, <i>in the Holy Spirit </i>[<font color="#0000FF">Rom. 14,17.</font>]. Would
that we might share in them richly, in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory and might,
with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and always and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">[1] The Greek has <i>diatheke</i>, which means a
&#145;disposition&#146;, in the sense of a &#145;will&#146; or &#145;testament&#146;. In
the LXX and NT it is the regular word for &#145;covenant&#146;. It does not seem to make
any sense in the context, though Moulton Milligan&#146;s comment on the word is
interesting: &#145;<i>diatheke</i> is properly disposition, an &#145;arrangement&#146;
made by one party with plenary power, which the other party may accept or reject, but
cannot alter.&#146; Migne has &#145;tumultus&#146;, but since it does not print the Greek,
whether this represents a different text, or is simply a guess to fit the sense is
unclear. The text as it stands may be corrupt, unless <i>diatheke</i> can be taken in the
sense of something like an &#145;ultimatum&#146;</font><font size="3" face="ClassGarmnd BT">.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Book Antiqua" size="6">CATECHESIS 62</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua" color="#0000FF">On our imitating the Lord&#146;s
sufferings.<br>
[Migne adds: <i>On the Forty Martyrs</i> [March 9th]. But it seems to have been given
after the day itself.]</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Brethren and fathers, how good it has become for us
the separation from the monastery here! <i>For why should our liberty be subject to the
judgement of another&#146;s conscience</i>? [<font color="#0000FF">1 Cor. 10,29.</font>] And why do we maltreat
ourselves still for what is of no use? We managed as far as it was possible and the moment
allowed; but now, because when the moment summoned they did not choose persecution on
behalf of Christ, as certain others, it is necessary to listen to the Prophet when he
says, <i>Come out from among them and be separated</i>, [<font color="#0000FF">Isa. 52,11.</font>] says the
Lord. If others act otherwise over these matters, they will render an account to the Lord
on the day of judgement; for it seems to me that to be brought under their power is
equivalent of being indifferent towards the heretics. You see that the same distinction
withdraws us from the world and drives us to trouble, to distress, to hunger, to
persecution, to prison, to death<i>; but in all these we must be supremely victorious
through the God who loved us</i>, [<font color="#0000FF">Rom. 8,37. St Theodore seems to be quoting from
memory<sup> </sup></font>] when, whenever he sees a soul thirsting for him, gives it force to
be able to endure sufferings on his behalf. And to this the Forty Martyrs, whose memorial
we have just celebrated, bear witness with the others; for we cannot say that they
possessed a different nature to the one we have. But since they loved God with a true
heart, they were empowered in their weakness to throw down the invisible enemy by the
flesh, and to accomplish a struggle of such a quality and greatness that all Christians
praise it in song. And blessed is one who has been granted to share in the sufferings of
Christ,[<i>  </i><font color="#0000FF"> Cf. 1 Pet. 4,13.</font>] even to some extent at least: the persecuted, because he
too was persecuted; the arrested, because he too was arrested; the reviled, because he too
was reviled; the scourged, because he too was scourged; the imprisoned, because he too was
imprisoned; see too why it is written, <i>If we have died with him, we shall also live
with him; if we endure, we shall also reign with him; if we deny, he too will deny us; if
we are faithless, he remains faithful; he is not able to deny himself</i>. [<font color="#0000FF">2 Tim.
2,11-13</font>] Do you see the promises and the threats, of what sort and how great they are?
For the rest then, brethren, let us strive, let us struggle by the grace of Christ not to
shame those things that have been previously mentioned, the banishments, the
imprisonments, the scourgings. We may not all have been imprisoned, nor all scourged; but
nevertheless the fellowship of life itself becomes a fellowship of sufferings, <i>for if
one limb suffers, all the limbs suffer with it; if one limb is glorified, all the limbs
rejoice with it</i>. [<font color="#0000FF">1 Cor. 12,26</font>] And would that we were even <i>more one body
and one spirit, as we have been called in one hope of our calling</i>, [<font color="#0000FF">Eph. 4,4.</font>]
having Christ as the head, to become well-pleasing to God, to gain the kingdom of heaven,
in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory and might with the Father and the Holy Spirit,
now and always and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Book Antiqua" size="6">CATECHESIS 63</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua" color="#0000FF">Historical, concerning the Christians
who were massacred in Bulgaria during the holy Lent, on account of meat-eating. On the 3rd
Sunday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Brethren and fathers, in the present instruction I
want to urge you to consolation from a certain story. The story is this: In Bulgaria, as
those who were accurately informed have reported, an evil decree went out from the ruler
there that the Christians in captivity and our brothers were to eat meat during the period
of the holy Forty Days; those who obeyed would live, those who disobeyed would be killed.
The word of the godless was exceedingly strong and the people assembled and there was
weeping and groans and much lamentation with women and children, on the one side of those
clinging to the Christian law, on the other of those quailing before the death of the
flesh. Finally &#151; ah, the pitiable announcement &#151; they were defeated and
submitted to the godless order. Fourteen of them though broke away and stood apart saying
it was not possible either to obey or to eat meat in violation of the Christian law. At
this, appeals and exhortations by the people: Let them yield to constraint, not die
foolishly, and through repentance they can be restored again. But nothing could persuade
them or weaken them from keeping their gaze fixed on God and on the blessedness that was
laid up in his promises. The Scythian then, when he saw the implacable determination of
the men, thought to subdue the rest by means of one, and having slain him he at once
distributed his children and his wife among the Scythians as slaves, so that the others
weakened by this would be brought over. But they rather remained unbowed and shouted out,
&#145;We are Christians, and our lot is that of our dead brother&#146;. At this confession
they were crucified on planks and died in the Lord. You see, therefore, brethren, that
even now too the Gospel of the kingdom of God is active. <i>One who loves father or mother</i>,
it says, <i>more than me is not worthy of me; and one who loves son or daughter or wife
more than me is not worthy of me; and one who does not take up his cross and follow after
me, is not worthy of me </i>[<font color="#0000FF">Matt. 10,37-38</font>]. And again, <i>Do not fear those who
kill the body, but cannot kill the soul; rather fear one who can destroy both soul and
body in Gehenna</i> [<font color="#0000FF">Matt. 10,28.</font>]. They were obedient then to the commands of the
Gospel, they obeyed the authority of the Lord and were wreathed with the crown of
martyrdom, imitating the holy Maccabees and doubling their number, for the Maccabees were
seven, but they were fourteen; the former so as not to taste swine&#146;s meat in
violation of the law, the latter so as not to partake of any meat in violation of the
Christian rule; this latter seems stricter, because for the Maccabees partaking of pork
was utterly forbidden, but for these men it was permissible to partake of any meat under
necessity, as St Basil says. But since the order from the Scythians was aimed at the
rejection of the faith, they refused; but they considered all things as secondary for the
love of Christ. O blessed men! O blessed action! in a single instant to have received in
exchange eternal rest! What will they say to this, those who deny that heretical communion
is a breach of faith? For if there there was a breach of faith by the people over eating
meat, how much more here over the heretically sacrificed communion. Where too are those
who say that there is no ground for martyrdom in the image of Christ? For if there there
was ground for martyrdom for those who did not eat meat, how much more here is the ground
for martyrdom resplendent for those who have not denied. But the heretics, because they
are dark themselves, also speak things that are dark as they try to embroil others in
their own falls.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">But let us, brethren, glorify our good God, who
glorifies those who have glorified him, who reveals martyrs in this generation too, as we
reflect on the fact that if men who were apparently lowly, uneducated, married and with
children gave everything up for the love of Christ, how much more should we, who are
unmarried and outside the world, when the moment calls, become as zealous as the saints.
But this is for a day when Christ calls us; now though, let us stand firm for the
uninterrupted martyrdom according to the conscience. Let us not bow the knee to Baal,
brethren, and let us not give in when struck by the thoughts [<font color="#0000FF">&#145;The thoughts&#146;, <i>logismoi</i>,
are a technical term in the monastic literature and I retain the slightly awkward definite
article in English. The expression is effectively synonymous with &#145;the demons&#146;.
See the important treatment by Prof. A. Guillaumont in Évagre le Pontique. <i>Traité
Pratique ou le Moine</i>, tom. 1, pp. 54-98 [SC 170]</font>]; let us rather quench the fiery
arrows of the evil one with tears, with supplications, with compunction, with the other
batterings of the body, so that we too may be able to say with the Apostle<i>, Every day I
die, that is as certain as the boast in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord </i>[<font color="#0000FF">1
Cor. 15:31</font>.]; and with the holy David<i>, Because for you we die all the day, we were
reckoned as sheep for the slaughter </i>[<font color="#0000FF">Ps. 43:23.</font>]. With them may we be found
worthy to become heirs of the kingdom of heaven, in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be
glory and might, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever and to the ages of
ages. Amen.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Book Antiqua" size="6">CATECHESIS 64</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua" color="#0000FF">On the incarnate dispensation of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and that we should celebrate spiritually. It was spoken on the day of
the Annunciation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Brethren and fathers, the Annunciation is here and
it is the first of the Feasts of the Lord, and we should not simply celebrate as most do,
but with understanding and with reverence for the mystery. What is the mystery? That the
Son of God becomes son of man, using the holy Virgin as the means, dwelling in her and
from her fashioning for himself a temple and becoming perfect man. Why so? <i>That he
might ransom those under the law, as it is written, and that we might receive sonship </i>[<font color="#0000FF">Gal.
4,5.</font>]; that we may no longer be slaves, but free; no longer subject to the passions,
but free of passions; no longer friends of the world, but friends of God; no longer
walking according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. <i>Those who walk according
to the flesh, think the things of the flesh; those who walk according to the spirit, the
things of the spirit; for the thought of the flesh is death; but the thought of the
spirit, life and peace. And so the thought of the flesh is hostile to God, for it is not
subject to the law of God. Indeed it cannot be. Those who are in the flesh cannot please
God </i>[<font color="#0000FF">Rom. 8,5-8.</font>]. In brief this is the power of the mystery, and this is why
we should celebrate spiritually and behave spiritually, with holiness and justice, with
love, with gentleness, with peace, <i>with forbearance, with goodness, with the Holy
Spirit </i>[<font color="#0000FF">2 Cor. 6,6.</font>], so that as far as we ourselves are concerned we do not
render the dispensation of our Lord Jesus Christ empty and ineffectual. Not only that, but
we should both pray and grieve for the world. Why so? Because the Son of God came to save
the world, and the world rejects him. Tribes and languages reject him; the barbarian
nations reject him, those who have had his holy name invoked upon them reject him, some
through abandoning the faith, others through their evil lives. What should he have done
and did not do? Being God he became man, <i>he humbled himself, becoming obedient unto
death, the death of the cross </i>[<font color="#0000FF">Phil. 2,8.</font>]; he gave us his body to eat and his
blood to drink; he allowed us to call him Father, Brother, Head, Teacher, Bridegroom,
Fellow-heir and all the other titles which there is no time to mention now. And still he
is rejected, and still he bears it. <i>For</i>, he says, <i>I have not come to judge the
world, but to save the world </i>[<font color="#0000FF">John 12,47.</font>]. What then is there to say,
brethren? That the genuine disciples are grieved by the rejections of their
fellow-disciples, thus showing love both for the teacher and for the disciples. So too,
genuine servants suffer in the same way from the desertions of their fellow-servants. This
is why the great Apostle orders that <i>we should offer supplications, prayers,
entreaties, thanksgivings on behalf of all mankind, for kings and for all in high
positions </i>[<font color="#0000FF">1 Tim. 2,1-2</font><i>.</i>]; and elsewhere he says this on the subject, I<i>
speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie, my conscience bears witness with me in the Holy
Spirit, that I have a great grief and unceasing anguish in my heart; for I have prayed
that I might be anathema to Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to
the flesh </i>[<font color="#0000FF">Rom. 9,1-3.</font>]. You see the power of love? You see the height of
friendship? Moses shows it too when he says to God, <i>If you will forgive them their sin,
forgive; if not, wipe me out of the book which you have written </i>[<font color="#0000FF">Exodus 32,32</font>].
So we too, as genuine and not counterfeit disciples, should not only look to what concerns
ourselves, but we should grieve and pray for our brothers and for the whole world; for by
so doing what is pleasing to the Lord we shall become inheritors of eternal life, in
Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be the glory and the might with the Father and the Holy
Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font>&nbsp;<!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
