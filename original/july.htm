and Damian of Rome.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">These, who are different from those who are celebrated on the
1st of November, were from Rome, and were doctors by profession. They cured both men and
animals for nothing and asked no other payment except confession of Christ and faith from
those who were cured. They died as martyrs in 284 under Carinus and Nomerianus.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><b>2. The deposition of the precious Robe of our
most holy Lady the Mother of God in Blachernae.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The deposition took place in 473, in the reign of Leo the
Thracian, in the magnificent temple of the Mother of God in Blachernae, which was built,
according to some, by the same Leo, but, according to others, by his predecessors Marcian
and Pulcheria. The emperor Justin the younger completed the temple, which the emperor
Romanos Argyros rebuilt after it had been destroyed by fire in 1070. It was burnt down
again in 1434 and from then there remained a small shrine with the celebrated holy spring,
until in 1869 a beautiful little church was once again erected there, which is still
visible to-day. The name Blachernae was given after the 7th century to other temples and
monasteries also by their devout founders because of their devotion to this famous temple
in Constantinople.</font></p>

among the Saints Anatolios, Archbishop of Constantinople.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The martyr was from Caesarea in Cappadocia, a valet
(cubicularius) of the emperor Trajan. When constrained by him to eat meat offered to idols
he was unwilling to do so and was shut up in prison without food, where he committed his
spirit to God in the year 108.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The Hierarch was formerly a presbyter of the Church of
Alexandria, then he succeeded St Flavian as archbishop of Constantinople in 449. He was
present at the 4th General Council at Chalcedon and died in 458. The Stichera entitled
&#145;Anatolika&#146; (rather &#145;anatoliaka&#146;) in the Octoichos at Vespers and
Lauds some attribute to this Anatolios, while others (and perhaps more probably) to
another of the same name from the monastery of Studios, a disciple of St Theodore the
Studite, one of whose letters to whom has been preserved.</font></p>

Jerusalem, archbishop of Crete.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">He was from Damascus, son of George and Gregoria. He joined
the clergy and became secretary to Theodore, patriarch of Jerusalem, whence he acquired
the surname Jerusalemite. He was present at the 6th General Council, the second which was
summoned in Constantinople, in 680 in the reign of Constantine the Bearded. He became
deacon of the Great Church, that is of Haghia Sophia and then archbishop of Crete. He died
in 720 or 723. In addition to his other sacred writings he also composed various hymns,
among which was that called the Great Canon, which was perhaps the first so composed for
Christ&#146;s Church.</font></p>

venerable Andrew; therefore we all cry out to you: Do not cease to intercede for us all.</font></p>

<p><strong><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">5. Of our venerable Fathers Athanasios of
Athos and Lampadis the wonderworker.</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The venerable Athanasios was a native of Trebizond. He first
lived as a monk on the mountain called Kymaios or Kyminas, of Mysia in Bithynia. Later he
moved to Mt Athos where he established the largest monastery, known to-day by his name,
and called Lavra. He died around the end of the tenth century.</font></p>

intercede with Christ God that our souls may be saved.</font></p>

of the holy great martyr Kyriaki.</b></font></p>

long for you; and seeking you I struggle, and I am crucified and buried with you in your
baptism; and I suffer for your sake, that I may reign with you; and I die for you, that I
may live in you; but as a spotless victim now accept one who with longing is slain for
you. Through her prayers, as you are merciful, save our souls!</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Christ&#146;s Martyr has now called us together to
celebrate in songs of praise her godly struggles and contests; for valiant in thought she,
like her name, appeared as mistress of her mind and of unseemly passions.</font></p>

bishop of Tauromenium in Sicily.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">He was a contemporary of the Apostles, a native of Antioch,
and was brought to faith in Christ by Peter, the prince of the Apostles.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><b>11. Of the holy great martyr and all-praised
Efphemia, when she confirmed the Definition of the Faith.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">In the year 451, under the rulers Marcian and Pulcheria, the
4th General Council was summoned in Chalcedon against the monophysites Eftyches and
Dioskoros. After lengthy debates the 630 fathers who championed Orthodoxy and those who
followed the opposite view agreed that each side would write its Definition, that is their
doctrine of the faith and their opinion of the submitted proposition, in separate books
and ask from God the verdict on them. When they had done this they placed the two tomes
(books) in the coffin which contained the relics of St Efphemia and having sealed it they
went away. After holding all-night vigils of intercession for three days they opened it in
the presence of the Emperor and found the tome of the heretics at the Martyr&#146;s feet,
while that of the Orthodox was grasped in her right hand. On the subject of this martyr,
see September 16.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Apolytikion. Tone 3.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You filled the Orthodox with joy and shamed the
defenders of error, Efphemia, fair virgin of Christ; for you confirmed what the Fathers of
the Fourth Council had correctly taught. Glorious martyr, implore Christ God to grant us
his great mercy.</font></p>

among the saints Joseph, archbishop of Thessaloniki; and of our venerable father Nikodemos
of the Holy Mountain, the Teacher.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Aquila was from Pontus in Asia Minor, a Jew by race, a
tentmaker by trade. He happened to be at Corinth with his wife Priscilla in the year 52,
when Paul first came there. He gave him hospitality and the apostle stayed with them for
many days working himself at the same trade (Acts 18:2-3). Through Paul they came to
believe in Christ and they followed him from then on, co-operating with him and enduring
dangers with him for the preaching of the Gospel, as he testifies himself in the epistle
to the Romans, where he says, &#145;Greet Priscilla and Aquila my fellow workers in Christ
Jesus, who risked their necks on my behalf&#146; etc. (16:2-4).When and where they died is
uncertain.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Joseph was the brother of Theodore the Studite (Nov.11th),
and he is often called a Studite himself, especially when he is mentioned along with his
brother. The two of them together composed the canons of the Triodion, according to
Kodinos, in the period of Leo the Armenian, as they sat in the church of St Romanos
(Nov.18th). After becoming archbishop of Thessaloniki he was exiled two or times on
account of his devout zeal for the honour of the holy images; and when he had suffered
greatly he died in exile.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">She lived in the time of Diocletian and was from the city of
Iconium. Frightened by the persecution that was then raging she took her three year old
son Kirykos and left for Selefkia; but when she found the same terrible danger there she
made for Tarsus in Cilicia. There the governor arrested her and taking the child away he
endeavoured by spoiling him to lure him to himself. But he, lisping and calling on the
name of Christ, kicked the governor as hard as he could in the stomach. Enraged at this
the governor threw him down the steps of the tribunal. The child, his head smashed in,
yielded up his spirit. His blest mother, after enduring many tortures was finally
beheaded, in the year 296.</font></p>

of the synaxarion he became bishop of Pidachthoes (perhaps of Pida and Chloe, cities of
Galatian Cappadocia, under the metropolitan of Sevasteia. He was martyred by fire under
Diocletian in 200, when, as he departed for the fire which had been made ready for him, he
sang, so they say, the &#145;O Joyful Light&#146; as a hymn to the holy Trinity (cf. March

&#145;I am called Marina; by birth and nurture I am of Pisidia; and I call upon the name
of my Lord, Jesus Christ&#146;. After this she endured bonds and prisons and many

beyond Jordan, from a priestly family, a man of the desert and of ascetic character,
clothed in a melote (a sheepskin) and wearing a leather belt around his loins. His name
means &#146;The Lord is God&#146; or &#146;The Lord is strong&#146;. His zeal for the
glory of God is compared to fire and his word for instruction and rebuke to a burning
torch; hence he acquired the surname &#146;Zealot&#146;. He it was, on fire with this
zeal, who severely rebuked the godlessness and iniquity of king Achab and his wife
Jezabel. Through prayer he shut up heaven and it did not rain for three years and six
months. Ravens brought him the food he needed when he was in hiding by God&#146;s command
near the brook Chorrath. He multiplied the small supply of oil and flour of a poor widow
woman of Sareptha, who had welcomed him into her house, and he raised to life her son who
had died. He brought down fire from heaven on Mount Carmel and it burned up the sacrifice
to his God before all Israel for a demonstration of the truth. He slaughtered at the brook
Kisson the 450 false prophets, the priests who worshipped idols and led the people astray.
He received food miraculously at the hands of an Angel and by that food he was given power
to journey for forty days and forty nights. He saw God on Mount Horeb, as far as it is
possible for human nature. He foretold the catastrophe of the house of Achab and the death
of his son Ozochias, and he burned as a punishment two captains of fifty sent to him by
the latter by twice calling down fire from heaven. He parted the stream of Jordan and
crossed with his disciple Elisaius on dry land; finally as he was talking with him he was
suddenly snatched up by a fiery chariot, in the year 895 BC., and was taken up into
heaven, wither he was translated by God alive, lust like Enoch (Gen.5:24, IV Kingd.2:11).
But later on, after seven years, he rebuked Joram the son of Josaphat in a letter, as it
is written: And there came to him (Joram) in a letter from the prophet Elias saying; Thus
says the Lord, the God of David your father: In that you have not walked etc. (II
Chron.21:12). He sent it, in the opinion of the majority of exegetes, either by the hand
of his disciple Elisaius or some other prophet, to whom he appeared just as did on Mount
Thabor to the disciples of Christ (August 6th).</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">She was from a town in Galilee on the sea of Tiberias named
Magdala, whence she has the surname Magdalen. After Jesus had cast out the seven demons
from which she had previously suffered she became his faithful and inseparable disciple,
following Him and serving Him to the Cross and the Tomb. She then returned to Jerusalem
with the other Myrrhbearers and they prepared spices to anoint the Lord&#146;s body. On
the Sunday very early in the morning they went to the sepulchre and before the Angels had
yet appeared to reveal the Lord&#146;s resurrection the Magdalen had seen the stone rolled
away from the sepulchre and run and told Peter and John. She returned at once to the
sepulchre and as she stood weeping outside it she was allowed to be the first to see the
Lord risen from the dead. When she fell at his feet she heard the words: Do not touch me.
After the Lord&#146;s assumption everything about her is uncertain. Some say that she died
in Ephesus, where she had preached Christ.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Concerning the bishop and martyr see September 22nd. The
Prophet was the son of Buzi and a priest by rank. He was taken as a captive to Babylon in
the reign of Joachim (Jechonias). In the fifth year of the captivity, around 593 or 594
BC, he started to prophesy. The many symbolic actions which were ordered him by God gave
incitement to the most disgraceful mockeries to those who spoke endlessly against the
sacred cult. He prophesied for about twenty years and was murdered, so they say, by a
Jewish leader because he had rebuked for his idolatry. His prophecy is divided into forty
eight chapters and comes third among the major Prophets.</font></p>

Nikomedia; they were martyred under Maximianus in the year 306. Paraskevi was from a
village of Rome, daughter of devout parents Agathon and Politeia. She was born on a
Friday, hence her name. From childhood she was taught the sacred writings and devoted
herself to the study of the holy Scriptures while leading a monastic life and guiding many
to the faith of Christ. In the days of the Emperor Antoninus Pius she was arrested for
this and urged to worship the idols, but she answered in the words of the prophet Jeremy:
The gods who did not make the heaven and the earth, let them perish from the earth
(10:11). After undergoing frightful tortures she was finally beheaded, in the year 140.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua">He was from Nikomedia, son of Efstorgos and Evbouli. His
father was an idolater but his mother was of Christian ancestry. By her he was guided to
the true religion and he was instructed in the faith of Christ and baptised by the above
mentioned Hermolaos (cf. the 26th). After being taught the art of medicine he practised it
with love for mankind, healing by the grace of Christ rather than by his skill, and
displaying with sympathy every care of souls and bodies to all, as a result he was
suitably renamed Panteleimon instead of Pantoleon, which he had been called previously.
Once when he had opened the eyes of a blind man by the invocation of the divine name, he
also enlightened the eyes of his soul to an understanding of the truth, and this was the
cause of his martyrdom. When the man who had been blind was asked by some one how his eyes
had been opened he confessed with boldness just like the blind man in the gospel both the
physician and the manner of his healing. He was at once slain, while Panteleimon was
arrested and having undergone many scourgings he was finally beheaded in the year 305 in
the reign of Maximianus.</font></p>
