<p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><font size="6" color="#FF0000">CANON FOR THE
SYNODIKON OF ORTHODOXY</font></p>
<p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="5">INTRODUCTION<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">In the Triodia this Canon is ascribed to
Theodore the Studite, but it cannot be by him, since he had died several years
earlier. The author is almost certainly the Patriarch St Methodios. The
troparion of the 8th Ode which speaks of the famous Icon of Christ above the
Bronze Gate of the Palace reminds one of the poem on the subject that was
written by the Patriarch Methodios to celebrate its restoration. The rubric in
the Triodion says, ’after the Dismissal of Matins and before the Liturgy, we
go in procession, together with wood of the Cross and the revered Icons, to the
place where the Synodikon is to be read. As we go and as we return we sing the
following Canon’. If this canon was first sung in 843, it is tempting to
suggest that it may have been sung as the clergy and people made their way from
the church of the Mother of God in Blachernae, where the vigil had been
celebrated, to the Great Church, where the Liturgy was to be celebrated.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">It is perhaps worth remarking that one of
those present would almost certainly have been a seventeen year old boy from
Thessalonika, who had recently been sent to Constantinople on the death of his
father and placed in the care of Theoktistos the Logothete, the Empress
Theodora’s chief minister. The young man’s name was Constantine; though he
is better known by his monastic name, Cyril — the Apostle of the Slavs.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The Canon presents a number of linguistic and
historical problems, and this translation is only provisional. One of the
historical problems is why such prominence is given to otherwise almost wholly
unknown character, Lezix, who appears here as one of the leaders of the
iconoclasts. It seems that he was subsequently reconciled to the Church by the
Patriarch himself.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The two troparia that are sung after the Canon
are not without interest. The first, which is now the Apolytikion for the day,
seems to have been a rallying song of the Iconodules, for we read in the life of
St Theodore the Studite that shortly after the exile of Patriarch Nikephoros and
the removal of the icons, St Theodore organised a solemn procession of the
icons, during which this troparion was sung. In his Life we read that ‘he
ordered all the monks under him to take the icons in their hands, hold them high
and then march round the whole circuit of the monastery, sing the hymn, “We
worship your most pure icon, loving Lord”, together with other hymns of
victory to Christ the Victor. This took place on the glorious feast of Palms,
which we all believers celebrate before the Passion and Resurrection of the
Master’ [PG 99:185].<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoTitle" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The other troparion formed part of the ancient
office for the First Sunday of Lent, which was dedicated to the Prophets, in
particular Moses, Aaron and Samuel. The three are found together in Psalm 96:6, </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">’</span><span style="font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Moses and Aaron were among his priests: and
Samuel among those that call upon his name</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">’</span><span style="font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. The present Gospel for this Sunday is also a
survival from the ancient office, and it was chosen presumably because of the
words of the Apostle Philip to Nathaniel, ’</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;

counselled, the Lord will scatter.<o:p>
