<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Second Canon, whose
acrostic is:</font><font face="Book Antiqua"><br>
Give to me God&#146;s grace, blessed Elias. Joseph</font></big><font face="ClassGarmnd BT" size="3">.</font></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 1. Tone 8.<br>
The wonder-working staff.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">As to the widow&#146;s son, give life to my soul, which
has become a corpse, and make it bright with godly virtues, blessed Saint, guide it
towards life and make it a partaker of everlasting delight, longing to take delight in
you.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">When you were born your father was initiated into a
truly mighty wonder; for he saw you, O blessed one, eating fire and being swaddled in
flame. Therefore by your intercessions deliver me from everlasting fire.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Made great by your inclinations towards God, O blessed
one, you were truly always greatly zealous for the Lord. Therefore empower me, once I am
filled with divine zeal, to do God&#146;s will so that saved I may honour you.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><big>God who is beyond being was incarnate from you, O
All-blameless, and for us he appeared like us as man. Entreat him insistently, O All-pure,
to save me who have sinned more than all mankind and to deliver me from punishment.</big></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000"><big>Ode 3. O Lord, the
builder.</big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The priests of shame as enemies you slew, glorious
Prophet, aflame with zeal for God. Therefore I cry to you: Snatch me from the works of
shame and the everlasting fire.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">I put you forward as intercessor before the mighty God,
O blessed one, able to save me from every evil. Be persuaded by my humble prayer and do
not despise me as I entreat you.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">God, who brings all to pass, magnifies you, glorious
Prophet Elias, nourishing you of old through a bird. Beseech him to make me a partaker of
eternal delight and of the light to come.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Gate through which none may pass that leads to God, open
to me I beg, O Maiden, gates of repentance, cleansing me from the stain of sins with
showers of your mercy, O full of God&#146;s grace.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000"><big>Ode 4. You, Lord, are my
strength. </big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">God turned all your fiery zeal and sent you to nourish a
widow, inspired Elias, who by a woman&#146;s threat had of old become a fugitive. And so I
implore you to nourish my hungry soul with divine gifts of grace.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Fierce clouds of sins cover me, billows of life buffet
me and the spirits of wickedness blow dreadfully against my soul. Prophet who speak of
God, become my pilot, directing me towards the haven of salvation.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Strength of soul, strength of body grant me, blessed
Elias, by entreating the Lord of glory who takes away the diseases of all; and guide me
safely to hasten through the stumbling blocks of life unharmed; for I put you forward as
my good defender.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">All-blameless Lady, with all the heavenly Powers, with
all the Prophets, Athletes, Apostles and Holy Ones, intercede that I, who have greatly
sinned, main find salvation and be delivered from the punishment to come.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000"><big>Ode 5. Why have you
thrust me.</big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Ablaze with the zeal of the faith you shut up the clouds
that give birth to rain; but, I beg you, Elias, by your sacred mediation water my soul,
melted by the flame of pleasures, with divine showers, and save me.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Shown forth as a priest, with guiltless hands you
sacrificed the priests of abominations who practised foul deeds; but I beg you, O Prophet,
guard me unharmed from every foul sin.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You were declared wonderful, O Prophet, blazing with
godly invocations you performed the sacrifices with faith; therefore I beg you
unceasingly: set alight in my heart the sacred love that burns up the fuel of my passions.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The Word beyond being came down upon you like rain;
entreat him, all-blameless Maiden, to rain pure drops of compunction on me, that will wash
away every stain of my numberless evils.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000"><big>Ode 6. Be gracious to me,
Saviour.</big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Be gracious to me, Saviour, who have foolishly sinned
greatly against you, and ransom me from the punishment that awaits me in the world to
come, for you have great Elias and your most pure Mother entreating you.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">As husbandman of purity keep me pure in soul; as zealous
Elias fill my mind with divine zeal, that I may beat off the assaults of wickedness.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You fasted with one food and accomplished a journey of
forty days with the help of God. Therefore I implore you: Empower me, O god-bearer, to be
master of every transgression.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">O gate of God open for my humble soul divine entrances,
by which I shall enter with thanksgiving and receive release from evils, O Mother of God.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000"><big>Ode 7. God&#146;s
condescension.</big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Taking pity on a people that was perishing, glorious
Prophet, with zeal of faith and godly invocations you brought down fire that consumed a
holy sacrifice. Therefore I implore you: deliver me from the eternal flame and save me.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">On mount Thabor you were counted worthy to see the face
of God. Beseech him, O Prophet, to overlook my sins and on the day of judgement with soul
uncondemned to contemplate his face.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">As I journey on life&#146;s road I take up many false
paths. Elias, my loving protector, with your protection pilot me, who am shaken by my own
inclination and assent to pleasures.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">O All-praised, I hymn you and I magnify your pure
child-bearing, O full of God&#146;s grace. Help me who am storm-tossed by the waves of
life and give to my humble soul compunction that cleanses from stains.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Another. The Chaldean
tyrant.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">We know you to have been a vessel that contained the
Spirit of God; for you, Elias, were an angel on earth who breathed the fire of divine
zeal, routed impiety, rebuked kings, anointed prophets and cut off the priests of shame
with the sword. And so we cry to you: Deliver us from shame to come.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">A chariot of fire took you from earth, Elias inspired by
God, ablaze with divine zeal; and so I implore you with the four-horsed chariot of your
virtues lighten my mind of the ills on earth; and entreat the God and King of all things
that I may reach the winning post in heaven.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">With a living word you shut up heaven from giving rain;
now with your spiritual word open to me, I beg, the gates of repentance, holy Prophet,
sending to my soul showers of compunction, and save me as I cry out: Priests bless, people
highly exalt Christ to the ages.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Of the Trinity.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">As we honour a Trinity in one Godhead, equal in
strength, identical in honour, consubstantial, equal in majesty, we honour Father, Son and
Holy Spirit, unsetting ray, might of equal kingship, and we sing with one accord: Priests
bless, people highly exalt the Lord to all the ages.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Born from you Emmanuel appeared framing laws of true
religion and teaching repentance. Most holy Lady now implore him to open for me gates of
righteousness and to save me as I cry out: Priests bless, people highly exalt him to all
the ages.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000"><big>Ode 9. Heaven was amazed.</big></font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You were counted worthy to see God in a light breeze, as
far it is possible to see him, having before made your body light by an ascetic life,
glorious Prophet; therefore I implore you that, lightening the grossness of my mind by
your prayers, you would shine on me with divine beams of repentance.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">As of old you parted the Jordan with your mantle and
crossed over, O all-blessed, so dry up too the streams of my dreadful sins, sending to my
soul each day, Prophet who spoke of God, showers of tears, granting me a torrent of
delight.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">From the many forms of stumbling blocks in life, from
lawless foes, every tribulation, bodily disease and perversion of soul, as a loving
protector, deliver me by your prayers, glorious Prophet, I cry out to you and from eternal
condemnation in Gehenna.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You were snatched up to the height, glorious Elias,
leaving behind to Elissaios when he asked double the grace of the Spirit. With him
ceaselessly beg victory from heaven and forgiveness of offences for our Sovereign, made
rich with you as unashamed protector with the Master.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><big>As you are loving, do not despise the voices of your
servants, all-blameless Lady; but insistently beg the Master of all things, O Virgin, to
grant trophies of victory to our Sovereign, health of soul and a share in and the
splendour of God&#146;s kingdom.</big></font></p>
