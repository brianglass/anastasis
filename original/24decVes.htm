<p align="center">Commemoration of the Holy Virgin Martyr Evgenia.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="5">AT VESPERS</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">At</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Lord, I have cried </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">we
insert 6 Stichera, and we sing Prosomia of the Forefeast.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Tone 4. As noblest of Martyrs.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Let us sound the cymbals, let us cry out with joy in songs: Christ&#146;s revelation
has been made manifest. The proclamations of the Prophets have reached their term, for the
one they said would appear in flesh to mortals is being brought to birth in a holy Cave,
laid in a manger like a babe and wrapped in swaddling clothes like little child.</p>

<p>With upright mind let us make songs ring out for the Forefeast of Christ&#146;s
Nativity. For he that is equal in honour to the Father and the Spirit, having through
compassion clothed himself in our matter, is about to be born in the city of Bethlehem.
Shepherds with Angels sand the praise of his ineffable birth.</p>

<p>Seeing a Conception beyond explanation and Birth beyond expression, the Virgin was
amazed. Rejoicing and yet also weeping she exclaimed, &#145;How can I offer my breast the
him who nourishes the universe? Or how can I sing your praise as both my Son and my God?
By what title can I address you, Lord beyond all naming?&#146;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Prosomia of the Saint. Tone 2. When from the Tree.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>When with godlike foresight you went out from the city, you clearly left behind the
pleasure of the world; and having heard the sweet melody of psalms, you were flooded with
the light of divine knowledge; while having conceived fear in your womb, you gave birth to
a divine and saving Spirit for those who journeyed with you.</p>

<p>When you had been made a bride of Christ, with zeal you brought to your servants to
him, bearing them as a living gift, imitating your courage, Evgenia, shining out clearly
with faith and grace, practising every virtue, as true Martyrs proclaiming to all true
religion.</p>

<p>Clearly illumined by the beam of the Spirit, you bring a choir of virgins to Christ,
having caught them by your word of wisdom and shown them the course of the path that leads
on high, you guided them to shine with the blood of Martyrs. Dancing with them, you have
now found a fitting desire: true delight, all-praised Martyr.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> Tone 2.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>See, the moment of our salvation has drawn near. Cave, make ready, the Virgin draws
near to give birth. Bethlehem, land of Juda, rejoice and be glad, because from you our
Lord has dawned. Listen, mountains and hills and all the country of Judea, for Christ is
coming to save humanity that he fashioned, for he loves mankind.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">At the Aposticha, Idiomels.<br>
Tone 1. By Anatolios.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You peoples, let us celebrate the Eve of Christ&#146;s Nativity; and raising our minds
on high let us go up in spirit to Bethlehem; and with the eyes of the soul let us look on
the Virgin as she hastens to give birth in a Cave to our God, the Lord of all things.
Joseph, when he looked on the greatness of his wonders, thought that what he saw was a
mortal, wrapped in swaddling clothes as a babe; but from all that came to pass he
understood that it was the true God, who grants our souls his great mercy.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> God will come from Theman, and the
Holy One from a shaded, wooded mountain.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Same Tone. Also by Anatolios.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You peoples, let us celebrate the Eve of Christ&#146;s Nativity; and raising our minds
on high let us go up in spirit to Bethlehem; and look on the great mystery in a Cave; for
Eden has been opened as God comes forth from a pure Virgin, perfect in his divinity as in
his humanity. Therefore let us cry: Holy God, Father without beginning, Holy Strong,
incarnate Son, Holy Immortal, Comforter Spirit. Holy Trinity, glory to you!</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Lord, I heard your report and I was
afraid; Lord, I considered your works, and was amazed.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Same Tone. Also by Anatolios.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth; for see, the Son and Word of God the Father
comes forth to be born of a maiden who has not known man, by the good pleasure of him who
begat him impassibly and by the co-operation of the Holy Spirit. Bethlehem, prepare; Eden,
open your gate, for he who is becomes what he was not, and the Fashioner of all creation
is fashioned, he who grants the world his great mercy.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both Now.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> Tone 6.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Cave prepare, for the Ewe Lamb comes bearing Christ in her womb; Manger receive him who
with a word has loosed us born of earth from irrational action. Shepherds abiding in the
fields, bear witness to a fearful wonder; Magi from Persia, offer the King gold,
frankincense and myrrh; for the Lord has appeared from a Virgin mother. Bending over him
like a slave, his Mother worshipped him and addressed him as he lay in her arms: How were
you sown in me? How have you grown in me, my Redeemer and my God?</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Apolytikion. Tone 4. Joseph was amazed.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Mary once, with aged Joseph, went to be enrolled in Bethlehem, for they were of
David&#146;s line; and she bore in her womb the fruit unsown. The time of the birth was at
hand and there was no room at the inn; but the Cave proved a fair palace for the Queen.
Christ is born, that he may raise up again his image that of old had fallen.</font></p>
