<p>Apostles of Christ, workmen of the Saviour, bearing the Cross like a plough 
on your shoulders, you purified the conquered earth of the deception of idols 
and sowed the word of Faith, and so you are rightly honoured, holy Apostles of 
Christ.</p>
<p>Glorious Apostles, pillars of the Church, Heralds of the truth, as lighted 
torches you set fire to every error and enlightened the human race with the fire 
of the Spirit; therefore we ask: implore our Saviour and God to give peace to 
the world and to save our souls.</p>

<p>Breathing as one, looking to one end the victorious Martyrs found one road of 
life, death for the sake of Christ, as they emulated each other’s end - O the 
wonder! - grasping tortures like treasures, they said to one another: Should we 
even now not die, we shall most surely die, and by birth we shall serve what is 
due; let us perform the duty which loves honour, purchasing life with death. At 
their prayers, O God, have mercy on us.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now. </font>

<p>Alas, I have became a haunt of pleasures, wretch that I am! Therefore I ever

pray, O Pure one, and let those who rejoice at my destruction be put to shame.</p>
