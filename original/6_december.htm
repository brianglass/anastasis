<p>Bodily you dwelt in Myra, but anointed with spiritual myrrh you were revealed
truly to be myrrh, Holy Nicolas, High Priest of Christ; and with myrrh you make
fragrant the faces of those who with faith and love ever celebrate your most
revered memory, as you free them, Father, from disasters, dangers and
afflictions by your prayers to the Lord.</p>

swiftly to help those who with love take refuge under your protection; for
appearing night and day by faith, you save them from trials and calamities.</p>
<p>You appeared to the Emperor Constantine with Avlavios in a dream, and filling
them with fear, you spoke to them like this, ‘Free from imprisonment at once
those whom you unjustly hold in chains, for they are innocent of lawless murder.
But if, Majesty, you disobey, I will make entreaty against you by beseeching the
Lord.’</p>
<p>Holy Nicolas, sacred herald of Christ, you are a great and fervent helper for
those in dangers, those on land and those who sail, those far off and those
nearby, a most compassionate and mighty intercessor. Therefore assembled
together we cry, ‘Intercede to the Lord that we may be rescued from every
calamity’.</p>

things far off, and proclaimed them clearly in advance, describing them as

King, inspired by God, and delivering from unjust slaughter those before in
chains, enriching them with God’s great mercy.</p>

<p>The memory of the just is with praises, and the Lord’s blessing of is upon
his head. Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the mortal who knows
understanding. For it is better to trade for her than for treasures of gold or
silver. She is more precious than valuable stones; nothing evil can stand
against her; she is well known to all who draw near her; nothing precious
matches her worth. From her mouth comes justice, she bears law and mercy on her
tongue. Therefore listen to me, my children, for I shall speak noble things; and
blessed is the one who will keep my ways. For my issues are issues of life, and
favour is prepared by the Lord. Therefore I beseech you and utter my voice to
the children of mankind. Because I, Wisdom, have prepared counsel and knowledge
and I have called upon understanding. Counsel and assurance are mine,
understanding is mine, strength is mine. I love those who are my friends, while
those who seek me will find grace. And so you simple folk understand subtlety,
you untaught lay it to heart. Hearken to me again, for I shall speak noble
things, and I shall open my mouth to speak things that are right. Because my
throat will meditate truth, but lying lips are abominations before me. All the
words of my mouth are with justice; there is nothing twisted in them or crooked.
They are all straight to those who understand, and right to those that find
knowledge. For I teach you what is true, that your hope may be in the Lord, and
you may be filled with Spirit.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from Proverbs.<br>
[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">10:31-32 &amp;
11:1-12</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>
<p>The mouth of the just drops wisdom; but the tongue of the unjust will be cut
out. The lips of just men know graces; but the mouth of the impious is turned
away. A false balance is an abomination before the Lord; but a just weight is
acceptable to him. Wherever pride enters, there too dishonour; but the mouth of
the humble meditates wisdom. The perfection of the upright will guide them, but
the crookedness of the treacherous will carry them off. Possessions do not
profit in the day of wrath, but justice will deliver from death. When a just man
dies he leaves regret; ready and welcome is the destruction of the ungodly. The
justice of the blameless keeps their ways straight, but impiety falls in with
injustice. The justice of upright men will deliver them, but transgressors are
caught by base counsel. When a just man dies his hope does not perish; but the
boast of ungodly people perishes. A just man escapes from the hunt, but the
ungodly is given up in his place. In the mouth of the ungodly people is a snare
for citizens, but the perception of the just brings prosperity. By the good
things of the just a city is successful, and in the loss of the ungodly there is
gladness. By the blessing of the upright a city will be exalted, but by the
mouth of the ungodly it will be overthrown. One who lacks sense sneer at their
fellow citizens, an intelligent man practices stillness.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the Wisdom of Solomon.<br>
[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">4:7-15</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>
<p>The just, though he die early, will be at rest. For old age is not honoured
for length of time, or measured by the number of years; but understanding is
grey hair for humans, and a blameless life is ripe old age. Being pleasing to
God he was loved by him, and while living among sinners he was taken up. He was
snatched away lest evil change his understanding, or trickery deceive his soul.
For the fascination of wickedness obscures the good, and roving desire perverts
the innocent mind. Though perfected in a short time he fulfilled long years; for
his soul was pleasing to the Lord, and so he took him quickly from the midst of
evil. Yet the peoples saw and did not understand, nor take such a thing to
heart, that grace and mercy are with his holy ones and his visitation with his
chosen ones.</p>
