<p align="center"><font size="5" face="Book Antiqua"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The canon, which is written to the same set of Irmi
as the Resurrection canon in Tone 8, is anonymous. There might be a clue in the use of the
<i>kalopoiïa</i> in Ode 3. This word, which is not in the lexica, I have only noticed
elsewhere in a canon by Joseph. Since, however, Joseph always &#145;signs&#146; his canons
in the ninth ode, the use of the word is probably not significant. The number of troparia
in each ode varies, Odes 1, 4 and 7 each having five troparia, the rest four. Odes 4 and
7, which come after the breaks in the canon, frequently have one more troparion than the
others. Here Ode 1, which begins the canon, also has an &#145;extra&#146; troparion. The
number of troparia may have been influenced by the acrostic, which forms a correct heroic
hexameter. I have not attempted to reproduce the acrostic, though the translation of the
acrostic itself forms a six foot iambic line, since English does not naturally accomodate
the hexameter.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The canon would seem to be fairly late, since apart
from the &#145;refrains&#146; in Odes 7 and 8, allusions to the biblical canticles are
almost entirely lacking. There is no reference to the Song of Moses, which is almost <i>de
rigueur</i>, in Ode 1, none to the Song of Avvakoum in Ode 4, not even to the ancient
refrain from the &#146;sung&#146;, or &#146;Cathedral&#146;, office &#145;Glory to your
power, O Lord!&#146;, none to Jonas in Ode 6, while in Ode 9 the word &#145;magnify&#146;
does not occur at all. All these allusions are, however, found in the Irmi on which the
canon is based.</font></p>

  <li><font face="Book Antiqua"><strong>Psalm 44,15.</strong></font></li>
  <li><strong><font face="Book Antiqua">The word <i>kallopoiïa</i> is unattested in the
    lexica. It also occurs in the 9<sup>th</sup> Ode of the canon for St Artemios on 20
    October, whose author is given as &#145;Joseph&#146;. The cognate adjective is, however,
    common and means &#145;creating/producing beauty&#146;. In the canon for St Artemios the
    noun refers to the &#145;struggles&#146; of the martyr and the phrase used means something
    like &#145;made lovely by the struggles that create beauty&#146;. Here the reference is
    presumably to God.</font></strong></li>
  <li><strong><font face="Book Antiqua">There is a problem of text here. The <i>Apostoliki
    Diakonia </i>has &#145;filled&#146;, while <i>Phos</i> has &#145;inherited&#146;. These
    differ by only one letter in Greek. HTM reads &#145;inherited&#146;, which is perhaps the
    better reading, and takes the final clause to refer to &#145;virtues&#146; rather than
    &#145;mansions&#146;, translating the verb by &#145;accomplish&#146;. It is difficult,
    however, to take &#145;these&#146; as referring to the remoter object.</font></strong></li>

  <li><font face="Book Antiqua"><strong>The HTM version of the final clause of this troparion
