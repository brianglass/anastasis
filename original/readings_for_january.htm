anticipates those who desire her before they know it, and is easily contemplated

rises for her at dawn will not toil, and one who keeps vigil because of her will
be without care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For she goes about
seeking those who are worthy of her, and shows herself favourably to those on
her paths.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wickedness will never
prevail against wisdom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of
this I too became a lover of her beauty and became her friend, and I sought her
out from my youth, and I sought to take her as my bride,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

old and those that are to come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
knows the twists of words and the explanations of riddles. She foresees signs
and wonders and the outcomes of seasons and times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And to all she is a good counsellor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because immortality is in her, and fame in the fellowship of her words.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore I appealed to the Lord and besought him and said
from my whole heart, ‘God of my Fathers and Lord of mercy, who made all things
by your Word, and established humanity by your Wisdom to be sovereign over the
creatures that had come into being by you, and to order the world in holiness
and justice, give me Wisdom who sits by your throne, and do not reject me from
among your children, for I am your servant and the son of your maid servant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Send her out from your holy dwelling and from the throne of your glory,
that she may be present with me and teach me what is well pleasing before you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And she will guide me with knowledge and guard me with her glory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

unstable.’</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt"><o:p>

as many of us as were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death. We were
buried then with him through baptism to death, so that, just as Christ was
raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too might walk in
newness of life. For if we have grown into union with him through a death like
his, we shall also be united with him in the resurrection. For we know that our
old self was crucified with him, so that our sinful body might be done away
with, that we might no longer be in slavery to sin. For one who has died has
been justified from sin. If then we died with Christ, we believe that we shall
also live with him. For we know that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no
more; death no longer lords it over him. As to dying, he died once and for all;
as to living, he lives for God. Consequently, you also must consider yourselves
dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.<o:p>

price. Why do you spend money on what is not food, and toil for what does not
satisfy? Hear me, and eat what is good, and your soul will delight in good
things. Give heed with your ears and follow in my ways. Listen to me and your
soul will live among good things. And I will make an eternal Covenant with you,
the sure mercies of David. See, I have given him as a testimony among the
Nations, a ruler and commander among the Nations. See, Nations who do not know
you will call upon you, and peoples who are not acquainted with you will take
refuge with you, for the sake of the Lord your God and the Holy One of Israel,
because he has glorified you. Seek the Lord, and when you find him, call upon
him. But when he comes near you, let the impious abandon his ways and a lawless
man his plans. And return to the Lord and you will find mercy, and cry out, for
he will abundantly forgive your sins. For my plans are not like your plans, nor
are my ways like your ways, says the Lord. But as far as heaven is from earth,
so far is my way from your ways and your thoughts from my mind. For as rain or
snow comes down from heaven and does not return until it has saturated the earth
and it brings forth and sprouts and gives seed to the sower and bread for food,
so will my word be. Whatever comes out of my mouth will not return to me empty,
until everything that I wished has been fulfilled. And I will make my ways and
my commands prosper. You will go out with gladness and be taught with joy. For
the mountains and hills will leap up, welcoming you with joy, and all the trees
of the field will clap with their branches. And instead of brambles cypress will
come up, and instead of nettles myrtle will come up. And there shall be for the
Lord a name and an everlasting sign, and it will not fail.</font><o:p>

desire wisdom, and long for it and be instructed. For her beginning is love and
keeping of laws. Honour Wisdom, that you may reign for ever. I will declare the
mysteries of God to you and not hide them from you. Because he is both the guide
of Wisdom and the One who sets right the wise. In his hand are all prudence, and
knowledge of works. Wisdom, the artificer of all things, taught me, for in her
is an understanding spirit, holy, brightness of the eternal light and image of
the goodness of God. She makes friends of God and prophets. She is more lovely
than the sun, and beyond every order of the stars. If compared to light, she is
found before it. She delivered her devotees from toils, and guided them in
straight paths. She gave them holy knowledge and protected them from those who
lay in ambush for them. She awarded them a mighty contest, that all might know
that true religion is more powerful than all, and that wickedness can never
prevail against Wisdom, nor will justice in passing sentence overlook evil
people. For they said in themselves, not reasoning correctly, ‘Let us
overpower the just one, let us not spare his saintliness, nor feel reverence for
the aged grey hairs of an elder. Let our strength be law. Let us lie in ambush
for the just, for he is a hindrance to us and he is opposed to our works and
alleges the sins of our upbringing. He claims to have knowledge of God, and
calls himself a child of the Lord. He has become a reproof to our thoughts. He
is grievous for us even to look at, for his life is not like others and his
paths are quite different. We are reckoned by him to be counterfeit, and he
keeps away from our ways as from filth. He calls the end of just people blessed.
Let us see if his words are true, and let us test what will happen to him at the
end. Let us examine him by insult and torture, that we may know his forbearance
and make trial of his patience. Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for he
will have protection from his own words.’ This was how they argued, and they
were deceived, for their wickedness had blinded them. And they did not know the
mysteries of God, nor did they judge that you alone are God, who have authority
over life and death, who save in time of tribulation and deliver from every ill;
pitying and merciful, giving grace to your holy ones, and by your right arm
resisting the proud.</font></span></p>

    This phrase presents considerable problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>It does not occur in the critical texts, which simply have
    ‘habitations of reed’. It does, however, occur in 34:13.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>It is unclear why the pious baronet, Sir Lancelot C. L. Brenton, renders it
    ‘ready habitations’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Does
    he mean ‘reedy habitations’?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    word I have rendered ‘owls’ is in Greek ‘sirens’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>In 34 the context is negative, ‘Thorns shall grow up in their
    cities. … They shall be habitations of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sirens
    </i>— which the pious baronet translates, both here and elsewhere, by
    ‘monsters’ —, and a court of ostriches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>And demons will meet with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">onokentauroi
    </i>[which means in classical Greek ‘tailless apes’!].’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Here, though, the meaning should be positive.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The coupling of ‘sirens’ and ‘ostriches’ also occurs
    at Job 30:29, again in a negative context. ‘I have gone groaning without
    being muzzled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I stood crying
    out in the assembly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have
    become brother of sirens and companion of ostriches’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>On this passage St John Chrysostom says, ‘By sirens he means some
    form of bird that sings, like kingfishers or owls, both of which have
    mournful songs’. Hence I tentatively put ‘owls’ here, though perhaps
    the translator was thinking of the mythical Sirens, whose song was so
    alluring that it led mariners to their doom. A possible translation might be
    ‘songbirds’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

    I retain the translation ‘man’, since the passage is used liturgically

    The Greek is ‘proselyte’, but the word in the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">lxx</span>
    simply means someone who ‘comes to one’ from elsewhere. The French

    connotation in English.</span><o:p>
