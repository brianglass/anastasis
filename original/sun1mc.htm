forget your poor for ever.</p>

<p>You were willingly nailed to the Cross, O Merciful one, and laid in a tomb as a mortal,
O Giver of life. By your death, O Powerful one, you smashed its might; for Hell&#146;
gatekeepers trembled before you; you raised with you the dead from every age, for you

<p>The women came to your tomb at dawn and when they saw a vision of an Angel they
trembled; the tomb blazed forth life; the marvel amazed them; and so going back to the
disciples they proclaimed the Resurrection: Christ has despoiled Hell, as alone mighty and
powerful, and has raised up all those in corruption, dispelling the fear of condemnation
by the power of the Cross.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Verse:</font> I will praise you, Lord, with my whole heart; I
will tell of all your marvellous works.</p>

<p>O Life of all, you were nailed to the Cross; O immortal Lord, you were numbered among

therefore the heavenly Powers cried out to you, O Giver of life: Glory to your sufferings,
O Christ; glory to your Resurrection; glory to your condescension, only lover of mankind.</p>
