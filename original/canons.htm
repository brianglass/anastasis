<p align="center"><font size="6" color="#FF0000">CANONS</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">The following pages contain Canons from the office
of Matins and other services. They are collected under the names of writers, even though
many of the attributions may be uncertain, so that readers may more easily study the
theology and style of the individual hymn writers of the Church.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">These Canons are for the most part the work of the
great hymn writers of the seventh and eighth centuries. Most of them were monks and came
from three main areas of the Byzantine world: that centred on the monastery of St Sabbas,
near Bethlehem; the Studite monastery of St John the Baptist in Constantinople, and <i>Magna
Graecia, </i>that is Sicily and Southern Italy, notably the monastery of Grottaferrata. St
Sabbas and Grottaferrata are still active monasteries, even if the latter is now Greek
Catholic, but the Studite monastery is a neglected ruin in a run down quarter of Istanbul.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Of the three books mentioned above, the <i>Paraklitiki</i>,
or <i>Large Oktoichos</i>, is the bread and butter book, providing the material for
Vespers, the Midnight Office, Matins and the Liturgy for most of the year from the Sunday
of All Saints to the beginning of Lent. Many of its texts are also found in the <i>Pentecostarion</i>.
Apart from the canons at Matins, few of the texts have the names of the authors attached
to them and so this paper will confine itself to the canons. The canons for Sundays are,
in the main, the work of <a href="john-dam.htm">St John of Damascus</a> [c.675&#150;c.750]
and St Metrophanes of Smyrna [9th century], who wrote the canons in honour of the Trinity
for the Sunday Midnight Office. The weekday offices are principally the work of <a href="jo-hym.htm">St Joseph the Hymnographer</a> [810&#150;886], who wrote at least
fifty-six of the ninety six canons for weekdays. The next major contributor was <a href="theophan.htm">St Theophanes the Branded</a> [775&#150;845], whose contribution
amounts to at least nine and possibly as many as twenty-three canons. The accompanying
table gives the full statistics.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">A canon is a highly structured and disciplined
literary form; an icon in words rather than paint. What I want to draw your attention to
in particular is the skill of the poets in bringing together a number of different themes
and ideas within this highly formal pattern. Each ode is linked to one of the biblical
canticles between the verses of which the troparia of the canon are meant to be sung, as
they still are on the Holy Mountain. Each troparion of an ode follows with considerable
strictness the metrical scheme of the Irmos, which is not necessarily by the writer of the
canon. The metrical scheme is based on stress accents, not on quantity, as in classical
Greek and Latin poetry. Earlier writers, like St Gregory the Theologian, had made
experiments with classical metres, but these met with little success, and from the golden
age of the kontakion in the sixth century, the use of metrical schemes based on stress had
prevailed. One other method had been tried, that of strict isosyllabic metres as in Syriac
poetry. This seems to have been limited to the unknown poet, or poets, who translated St
Ephrem the Syrian into Greek and also composed verse sermons in imitation of him. </font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Each day of the week has a particular theme, which
the canon must develop. The theme of the office on Mondays and Tuesdays is
&#145;compunction&#146;; on Wednesday the Cross; on Thursdays the Apostles; on Friday the
Cross, and on Saturday the Saints. Each day, moreover has a secondary theme: on Monday the
Angels, Tuesday St John the Baptist, Wednesday and Friday the Mother of God, Thursday St
Nicolas and Saturday the Departed. These secondary themes are celebrated the second canon.
In addition, the first canon each day must include two troparia in honour of the Martyrs.
The final troparion of every canon honours the Mother of God.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">I have seldom attempted the reproduce the acrostics
that are a standard feature of so many canons. Where I have done so, I have indicated this
typographically.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">With the exception of the Canon of the Little
Paraklesis, none of the texts on these pages has been translated to the strict metrical
patterns of the originals.</font></p>
