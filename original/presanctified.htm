of the Liturgy of the Presanctified is intended to be practical, rather than
critical. It is based for the most part on the 3rd volume of the <i>Hieratikon</i>
published by the Monastery of Simonos Petra in 1992, together with second
edition of the Greek text published by Professor Phountoulis in 1986 and the 3rd
edition of <i>Megali Tessarakosti</i> by the <i>Apostoliki Diakonia </i>in 1991.
The earlier edition by Rigopoulis 1977 and the Slavonic&nbsp;<i> Sluzebnik</i>,
Moscow 1996. There are many variations in the various editions and I hope to
provide more detailed annotation shortly, together with translations of St

the Priest at the beginning of the 9th Hour, the Deacon joins the Priest and
they go and make a metania to the Superior, or to his stall. Then, going to the
middle of the church, they make three bows, saying,</p>

<p>Then, having kissed the holy icons of Christ and the Mother of God, and
having asked pardon of the people, the enter the sanctuary, making three bows

It is customary not to wear marks of honour, such as pectoral crosses and
epigonatia. The Priest blesses the Deacon’s vestments simply with his right
hand, likewise saying nothing.</p>

three metanias, saying,</font><i><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> </font></i><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">O

Priest, having kissed the holy Gospel and made the sign of the Cross on the
Deacon’s head, gives the Dismissal of the 9th Hour.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Master, give the blessing.</p>

<p>While the Opening Psalm is recited by the Superior, or Reader, the Priest,
standing in front of the holy Table, reads the first four prayers for the
Lighting of the Lamps, if there is no Deacon, without their ekphoneses.</p>

<p>May Christ our true God, at the prayers of his most pure and holy Mother; by
the power of the precious and life-giving Cross, through the protection of the
honoured, Bodiless Powers of heaven, through the intercessions of the honoured,
glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist, John, of the holy, glorious and
all-praised Apostles, of the holy, glorious and triumphant Martyrs, of our
venerable and God-bearing Fathers and Mothers; of the holy and righteous
forebears of God, Joachim and Anne; of Saint </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">N.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b>Psalm 33</b></p>
<p>I will bless the Lord continually, his praise will always be in my mouth.</p>
<p>My soul will be praised in the Lord; let the meek hear it and rejoice.</p>
<p>Magnify the Lord with me, let us exalt his name together.</p>
<p>I sought the Lord and he heard me, and delivered me from all my afflictions.</p>
<p>Come to him and be enlightened, and your faces will not be ashamed.</p>
<p>This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him from all his
afflictions.</p>
<p>The angel of the Lord will encamp round those who fear him, and deliver them.</p>
<p>Taste and see that the Lord is good. Blessed the one who hopes in him!</p>
<p>Fear the Lord, all you his holy ones, for those who fear him never want.</p>
<p>The rich have become poor and gone hungry, but those who seek the Lord will
not be deprived of any good.</p>
<p>Come, children, listen to me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</p>
<p>Who is there who wants life, loves to see good days?</p>
<p>Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit.</p>
<p>Turn away from evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it.</p>
<p>The eyes of the Lord are on the just, and his ears towards their
supplication.</p>
<p>The Lord’s face is set against those who do evil, to destroy their memory
from the earth.</p>
<p>The just cried and the Lord heard them, and delivered them from all their
afflictions.</p>
<p>The Lord is close to those who are broken-hearted, and will save the humble
in spirit.</p>
<p>The afflictions of the just are many, but the Lord will deliver them from
them all.</p>
<p>The Lord guards all their bones, not one of them will be broken.</p>
<p>The death of sinners is evil, and those who hate the just will go astray.</p>
<p>The Lord will rescue the souls of his servants, and no one of those who hope
in him will go astray.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><b>Psalm 144</b></p>
<p>I will exalt you, my God, my King; and I will bless your name for ever and to
age on age.</p>
<p>Every day I will bless you; and praise your name for ever and to age on age.</p>
<p>The Lord is great and highly to be praised<b>;</b> and there is no limit to
his greatness.</p>
<p>Generation after generation will praise your works; and will declare your
power.</p>
<p>They will tell of the majesty of the glory of your holiness; and will recount
your wonders.</p>
<p>They will speak of the power of your dread deeds; and will recount your
greatness.</p>
<p>They will proclaim the memory of the multitude of your goodness; and rejoice
in your justice.</p>
<p>The Lord is compassionate and merciful; long-suffering and full of mercy.</p>
<p>The Lord is good to all; and his acts of compassion are for all his works.</p>
<p>May all your works confess you, Lord; and all your holy ones bless you.</p>
<p>They will speak of the glory of your kingdom; and tell of your power.</p>
<p>To make known your power and of the glory the majesty of your kingdom to the
children of mankind.</p>
<p>Your kingdom is a kingdom for all the ages, and your dominion for every
generation.</p>
<p>The Lord is faithful in all his words, and holy in all his works.</p>
<p>The Lord supports all who are falling, and sets upright all who are broken
down.</p>
<p>The eyes of all hope in you, and you give them their food in due season.</p>
<p>You open your hand, and fill every living thing with your good pleasure.</p>
<p>The Lord is just in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</p>
<p>The Lord is close to those who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.</p>
<p>He will do the will of those who fear him, and hear their supplication and
save them.</p>
<p>The Lord guards all who love him, and all sinners he will destroy.</p>
<p>My mouth will tell the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless his holy
name for ever and to age on age.</p>
