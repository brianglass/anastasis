<p>You handled the Master&#146;s side, all-blessed Apostle, and grasped the summit of
blessings; for like a sponge you soaked up streams from there, the source of good things
and eternal life, and you watered hearts dried up through ignorance of God, as you well up
with the doctrines of the knowledge of God.</p>

<p>By your believing unbelief you confirmed believers when you began to speak of him as
God and Lord of all creation, he who bore flesh for us who are on earth and who endured
the Cross and death and the holes of the nails and who was pierced by a lance in his side,
from which we draw life.</p>

<p>Wondrous Thomas opened up the source of doctrines, Master, for the godly; for when he
handled your side he was fittingly initiated into the double energy with the two essences,
and he cried out: You are my God and Master, you are the Lord of glory, who became flesh
for my sake.</p>
