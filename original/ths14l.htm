<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">This Instruction is no. 14 of the <i>Large
Catechesis</i>. The list in Migne is confused, since two instructions are numbered
&#145;7&#146;. The title of the one for the Sunday of the Blind Man is the same as this
one, and the reference to spring suggests that it the one meant.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000"><big><big>On freedom from affections and on
self-mastery</big>.</big></font></p>
</font>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">My brothers, fathers and children, talking to you
and seeing you is for me comfort and consolation, while I am convinced that your
reciprocal love and sight of me is the same also for you, since after God I have no one
else, not father, not mother, not brothers, not relatives, not friends, apart from you my
most dear members and children and brothers and fathers, not have you any except me, an
unprofitable sinner. This affiliation is of the Holy Spirit. Flight from the world,
alienation, the denial of parents and all fleshly connections<sup>1</sup> have secured
this union for us. Therefore this sacred fellowship is acknowledged to be one soul and one
will for all. So then I rejoice each time I speak to you and address you, and am filled
with zeal and am on fire for your love according to God and your salvation that your work
as it progresses may progress, as it increases, may increase, as it shines, may shine to
my inexpressible joy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">I beg you then, my children, now too stand steadfast
and immovable from hope in God and by tearing apart the tangled wiles of the devil [ Cf.
Eph. 6:11.] show yourselves to be above the passions as you trample down the pleasures and
desires of the flesh and guard from every side your virginity and purity of soul and body.
You realize that it is springtime when every animate nature is moved to reproduction. Let
your sleep be in moderation, as I said to you before Easter, let your food be regulated as
prescribed.<sup>2</sup> It is good, says the Apostle, not to eat meat or to drink wine, or
do anything that makes your brother stumble.[Rom. 14:21.] And I too, my brothers, say by
way of advice, not as a regulation, for the sake of your precious souls, not to the sick
but to those who are in good health, it is good not to drink wine, particularly for the
younger ones, for through wine the passions are enflamed. We have in ourselves the tempest
of the physical pleasures; why then do we add the waves of wine to it? Taste therefore and
see that self-mastery in this regard is good. [Cf. Ps. 33:8.] For you will see yourself by
abstinence from wine rising above thoughts, freed from fever of the soul, awake to the
love of God and aroused for those things that are better and abound in salvation. One who
abstains from wine is filled with the Holy Spirit; one who drinks water has drunk the
streams of compunction. However, as you are able, act thus to preserve your bodily health
or in proportion to your toil; for I have not issued an order, but I am giving you advice
in the matter. And with regard to foods, my children, I have the same advice, to flee
irrational surfeiting and wanton indulgence, from which come dissolute behaviour and the
seeds of Sodom.<sup>3</sup> But you are to act with regard to eating and drinking and
everything else so as to rule and not be ruled by pleasures; so as to master and not be
mastered by the flesh. And this is the best. This is the best formula for soul and body:
for the better not be dominated by the worse. Be careful regarding journeys outside and
worldly contacts not to bring disturbances to the brotherhood. And those of you who are
assigned to the boats for going in and out and bringing in what is needed, do not
associate with secular people, neither talk nor shout like them, but let your sailing<sup>4
</sup>be seemly, so that God may be glorified by it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">I learn that some people are going down to the
gardens and asking the gardener for vegetables to eat and that when, because of the rule,
they do not get any, they pick a fight with the gardener. This is utterly satanic and is
to occur no longer, since those of you who behave thus will be subjected to punishments.
Is what is put before you not sufficient? How are you going to make war on passion if you
are defeated by a cabbage? You will become weaker than a feather if you do not fortify
yourself by thought through self-mastery. In short people both do become and have become
perfect from imperfect, very great from small, healthy from weak, men from boys, and we
too at least have become and let us continue to become and let us not be slothful, let us
not be sluggish. The Lord gives strength and might. [Cf Ps. 67:35.] Spreading his wings he
received them and took them on his back. [Deut. 32:11.] Thus he loves to save us, thus he
is near to those that call on him. [Ps. 144:18.] Thus then the Lord of glory will comfort
your hearts and firmly establish your souls and tightly gird your loins, beloved children,
for the battle line, for war with the adversary, for victory, for the routing of
opponents, for glory, for his praise, for inheritance of the kingdom of heaven, for to him
belongs glory, with the Father and his all-holy and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever,
and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><sup>1</sup> </font></big><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">I take the Greek here to be masculine, not neuter, and to refer to
&#145;relatives&#146;.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua"><sup>

<p><big>2 </big></sup></font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">The word is not in the
lexica, but the meaning is clear. This remark of St Theodore&#146;s may explain why the
normal fast days were prescribed from Thomas Sunday onwards.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua"><sup>

<p><big>3 </big></sup></font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">The adjective,
sodomitikos, is not attested in the lexica. Here it is linked with asotia, which echoes
the parable of the Prodigal Son. The elder brother in the parable asserts that his asotia
includes squandering his money on harlots among other things. This suggests that the
adjective also has sexual connotations. In view of St Theodore&#146;s earlier remarks
about spring this seems the most likely connotation of the word.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua"><sup>
