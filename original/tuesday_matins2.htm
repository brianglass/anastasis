<p>Gather my scattered mind, Lord, and cleanse my hardened heart, granting me
repentance as to Peter, groans as to the Publican, tears as to the Harlot, that
with a loud voice I may cry to you: Save me, O God, as alone compassionate and
lover of mankind.</p>
<p>Many times as I come to the end of singing hymns I am found to be full of
sin, for though I utter songs with my tongue, with my soul I think on foul
things; but set both to rights, Christ god, through repentance and save me.</p>
