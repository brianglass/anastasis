<p align="center">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</p>

<p align="left">The Office I have translated here is that written by the late
Father Gerasimos and first published in 1952 in connection with the decision by
the Church of Greece to move the day of the feast to the 28th of the month, to
commemorate the famous &#145;No&#145; of the Greeks to the Italians in 1941.
Father Gerasimos&#145;s text is centred on the original story of the vision of
the monk Andrew in the church at Vlachernae and not in the least nationalistic.
It is interesting, however, to note that in the text of the October Menaion
published by the <i>Apostoliki Diakonia</i> in Athens altered the third line of
the verses of the Synaxarion reads,</p>

<p align="center">
Protection of God&#146;s Mother now veils Greece,</p>

with her motherly care and grace manifestly protects from every assault those who look to
her and cry: Hail, Full of grace, protection and help of the your race that faithfully
magnifies you, O Virgin.</p>

<p>Ah, your wonders, Pure Virgin! For you marvellously unfolded your Protecting Veil and
wondrously protected the Queen of cities; while later by the grace of your light-bearing
Protection you openly saved the people that bears Christ&#146;s name from hostile threat.
Therefore, raising songs of grateful praise, rejoicing we commemorate your many wonders.</p>

<p>The choirs of believers, Sovereign Lady, proclaim your providence towards us, as we
praise your mother&#146;s care. For from of old in your compassion you placed us beneath
your Protection, and declared the race of the Orthodox to be your chosen lot. Therefore, O
Full of grace, we cry to you: Hail! and magnify the graces of your godly Protecting Veil.</font></p>

<p>As we celebrate the memorial of your Protecting Veil, O Immaculate, we magnify your
loving-kindness; because you rescue your race from every constraint and grant each day
unstinted grace to those who praise the astounding mighty works of your glory and the
greatness of its wonders.</p>

<p>Wondrously of old you invisibly unfolded your Protecting Veil and protected the Royal
City, but now even more manifestly you protect us, immaculate Maiden, and you guard and
keep safe from all affliction your new inheritance. Therefore we sing the praise of the
gifts of your Protecting Veil, O Virgin, and your constant help.</p>

<p>In many ways, O Maiden, we know and clearly we have seen the manifestation of your holy

readings.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from Numbers.<br>
[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">9:15-23</font>]</p>

<p>On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the house
of the testimony. And at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire
until morning. So it was continually. The cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of
fire by night. And whenever the cloud went up from the tent, after that the people of
Israel set out. And in the place where the cloud stopped, there the people of Israel
encamped. At the command of the Lord the people of Israel encamped, and at the command of
the Lord they set out. &#145;For as many days as the cloud overshadows the tabernacle, the
children of Israel will remain in camp. Even when the cloud has continued over the
tabernacle many days, the children of Israel will keep the charge of the Lord, and they
are not to set out. And it shall that whenever the cloud covers the tabernacle for a
number of days, in accordance with the word of the Lord they will remain in camp, and in
accordance with the command of the Lord they will set out. And it shall be that whenever
the cloud remains from evening until morning; and that the cloud goes up in the morning,
they will set out by day or by night. When the cloud overshadows it for a month, or
longer, the children of Israel shall remain in camp and not set out. Because they will set
out at the command of the Lord&#146;. They kept the charge of the Lord, at the command of
the Lord by Moses.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from Exodus.<br>
[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">40:15-32</font>]</p>

<p>And it came to pass in the first month in the second year since the children of Israel
had set out from Egypt, at the new moon the tabernacle was erected. And Moses erected the
tabernacle; he laid its capitals, put in its bars, and raised up its pillars. And he
spread the curtains over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tabernacle over it,
as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he took the testimonies and put them into the ark,
and put the poles under the ark, and put the covering of the veil on it and covered the
ark of testimony, as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he put the table in the tabernacle
of testimony, on the north side, outside the veil of the tabernacle. And he set the bread
of the on it before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he put the lampstand in
the tabernacle of testimony, on the south side of the tabernacle, and set up its lamps
before the Lord; as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he put the golden altar in the
tabernacle of testimony before the veil, and on it he burnt incense that had been
compounded; as the Lord had commanded Moses. And he set the altar of burnt offering at the
door of the tabernacle. And he set the court round the tabernacle of testimony. So Moses
finished the whole work. Then the cloud covered the tabernacle of testimony, and the
tabernacle was filled with the glory of the Lord. And Moses was not able to enter the
tabernacle of testimony because the cloud overshadowed it, and the tabernacle was filled
with the glory of the Lord. Whenever the cloud went up from the tabernacle, the children
of Israel would move off with their baggage. but if the cloud did not go up, then they did
not move off until the day that the cloud did go up. For the cloud was on the tabernacle
by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all Israel at every stage of their
journey.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the Prophecy of Ezekiel.<br>
[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">43:27-44:4</font>]</p>

<p>It shall be from the eighth day and upwards, the Priests shall make your holocausts
upon the altar, and those for your salvation; and I shall accept you, says the Lord. And
he turned me back by the way of the outer gate of the Holy Place, which looks towards the
east, and it was shut. And the Lord said to me: This gate shall be shut, it shall not be
opened, and no one shall pass through it, because the Lord, the God of Israel, will enter
through it, and it shall be shut. Therefore this prince shall sit in it to eat bread. By
the way of the Elam of the gate he shall enter, and by that way he shall go out. And he
brought me by the way of the gate towards the North, opposite the House; and I saw, and
behold the whole house of the Lord was full of glory.</font></p>

<p>Once, during an all-night vigil that was being celebrated in the holy shrine in
Vlachernae, the blessed Andrew went there, as was his custom. Epiphanios was there also
with one of his children. He was would stand there, as his custom was, because his fervour
gave him strength, sometimes until midnight, sometimes until dawn. And so, when it was
already about eleven o&#146;clock at night, the blessed Andrew saw with his own eyes a
most extraordinary vision coming in female form from the royal doors with a dread
entourage, among which was the honoured Forerunner and the son thunder, holding her by the
hand on either side, and many Saints, robed in white, went before her; while others
followed with hymns and spiritual songs. When she drew near the ambo, Andrew approached
Epiphanios and said, &#145;Do you see the Lady and Mistress of the world?&#146; He
replied, &#145;Yes, my spiritual father.&#146;</p>

<p>And as they watched, she bowed her knees and prayed for a long time, shedding tears
down her godlike and immaculate face. After her prayer, she advanced to the sanctuary,
where she entreated for the people present. So when she had removed the veil which she was
wearing on her most-pure head and which had the appearance of lightning, she unrolled it
and taking it with great reverence in her all-pure hands &#151; it was large and awesome
&#151; spread it out above all the people who were standing there. The saints saw it
stretched out over the people for a number of hours and blazing with the gory of the Lord
like amber. As long as the most holy Mother of God was there, it was visible also, but
after she had departed, it was no longer to be seen. For while she indeed took it with,
she felt behind her grace for those who were there.</p>

<p>At the prayers of your most pure Mother, Christ God, have mercy and protect us from
visible and invisible enemies and save our souls. Amen.</font></p>

<p>Brethren, now the first tabernacle had regulations for worship and an earthly
sanctuary. For a tabernacle was constructed, the first one, in which were the lampstand,
the table, and the bread of the Presence; this is called the Holy Place. Behind the second
curtain was a tabernacle called the Holy of Holies. In it stood the golden altar of
incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which there were a
golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron&#146;s rod that budded, and the tables of the
covenant; above it were the Cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these
things we cannot speak now in detail. Such preparations having been made, the priests go
continually into the first tabernacle to carry out their ritual duties; but only the high
priest goes into the second, and he but once a year, and not without taking the blood that
he offers for himself and for the sins committed in ignorance by the people.</font></p>
