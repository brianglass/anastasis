OF MAIOUMA</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The following extract from St Nikodemos of the Holy
Mountain's commentary on the festal canons is of some interest.</font></big></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4" color="#0000FF">On the music of the
festal canons of St Kosmas the Melodist </font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><big>Since Saint Kosmas utilised for his musical Canons the
usually chanted Tones, we have therefore decided to set out for readers the relevant
information about them, as a relish, as Theodore [the Poor Forerunner] gives it. The
Tones, as every one knows, are eight in number, four being straight, ruling and leading ,
the other four are oblique of the straight. Now Bishop Kosmas employs all of them, except
for one, Plagal of the First. He employs them skilfully and with great elegance; for he
employed the <font color="#0000FF">First</font> for the first feast, that is for the <font color="#0000FF">Birthday of the Saviour</font>; the <font color="#0000FF">Second</font>
for the second feast of the Lord, that is for the feast of the <font color="#0000FF">Theophany</font>
and the Baptism of the Lord; the <font color="#0000FF">Third </font>for the third feast of
the Lord, that is the <font color="#0000FF">Meeting</font>, which although it is second in
the natural order, is third in the course of the year and the cycle of the months. He
employed the <font color="#0000FF">Fourth</font> for the fourth feast, that of <font color="#0000FF">Palms</font>, for this is the fourth feast from Christ&#146;s Nativity
(the feast of the Circumcision is passed over as being a feast of the old Jewish law);
while the Annunciation is also passed over, not because it is not a feast of the Lord, but
because it sometimes falls before Palm Sunday and sometimes after it. When he reaches the <font color="#0000FF">Great Week</font> of the Sufferings, the Melodist omits the Plagal of the
First Tone, since it is festal and joyous, and does not suit grief and suffering. For the
whole of this week he employed exclusively the <font color="#0000FF">Plagal of the Second</font>
and the <font color="#0000FF">Second</font>, because as these holy days are ones of
sorrow, so likewise these Tones are sorrowful; and even though the feats of the
Lord&#146;s sufferings are causes of joy, nevertheless there is no soul, unless it were
harsh and savage, that cannot but grieve and weep during those holy days.</big></p>

<p><big>When St Kosmas reached <font color="#0000FF">Pentecost</font> he employed the
Plagal of the Third Tone, that is the <font color="#0000FF">Grave Tone</font>, thus
imitating, I imagine, that sound which came from heaven to the holy and sacred Apostles
(Acts 2:2). Finally the inspired Hymnographer employed the final Tone, that is the <font color="#0000FF">Plagal of the Fourth</font>, for the final feast, that is the Exaltation
of the Cross; because, although the temporal cycle starts from autumn and the new year,
that is from September, and makes this the first feast, nevertheless in actual fact it is
the last of all, because this feast refers to events many years after the Lord&#146;s
Assumption. Moreover the Plagal of the Fourth Tone is peculiarly apt for the feast of the
Exaltation of the Cross: fourth because of the four parts of the Cross; plagal through its
connection with the cross-beam; that is with the crosswise arm of the Cross, which joined
with the upright excellently depicts the Cross. But why did St Kosmas employ the <font color="#0000FF">Fourth</font> Tone for the <font color="#0000FF">Transfiguration</font> as
well, as he had employed it for the feast of Palms? No doubt because of the festal quality
of the tone; because for festal celebration it is proper that a festal tone be sung; and
also no doubt, that since for this feast the Fourth Tone had been sung, for this reason
the Melodist decided that the Plagal of the Fourth should be sung for the feast following
the Transfiguration.</big></p>
