<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font size="5">INTRODUCTION</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font size="4">The ceremony of the Washing of the Feet on Holy
Thursday is very ancient, and is common to both East and West. In English it is
the origin of the name </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">’Maundy
Thursday’, from the Latin ’mandatum’, ’commandment’, which is used in
the Vulgate of Saint John’s Gospel, ’mandatum nouum do uobis’, ’a new
commandment I give you’. In the Latin the ceremony still forms part of the
regular Holy Weeks services and in England, in a survival of pre-reformation
Catholicism, the monarch still distributes specially purses of minted ’Maundy
Money’ on this day, though there is no longer any washing of actual feet. In
the fourth century the ’Pedilauium’, ’Footwashing’ formed part of the
rite of Baptism at Milan, where it followed the Chrismation. Saint Ambrose
remarks that the ceremony, as part of Baptism, was unknown in Rome. In the East
it is still performed on Holy Thursday in the Armenian Church, but in the
Byzantine Rite it is nowadays confined to some cathedrals and monasteries. On
Patmos the monks of the great monastery perform the ceremony in the open air in
the middle of the village.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">This provisional version has
been made from the text in the Greek Mega Euchologion, since the rite is no
longer included in the printed Triodia in either Greek or Slavonic. In the
French version published by P. Denis Guillaume the first Gospel is set out in
dramatic form, with the Abbot speaking the words of Christ and the Bursar those
of Saint Peter. Without at least a Deacon to read the Gospel while the Priest
does the actual washing, it is difficult to perform the ceremony correctly,
which may be one reason why it has fallen into desuetude.</font></p>
<hr size="4" color="#FF0000">
<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="6">SERVICE OF THE DIVINE AND
SACRED WASHING</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>After the prayer behind the ambo, the Priest comes out, changed as he is,
with lights and incense, outside the main doors of the church, the basin for the
Washing having been got ready by the Ecclesiarch. Twelve brethren having been
appointed who are to be washed by the Superior, among whom must be included the
Porter and the Bursar, we assemble with the Priest, singing Psalm 50. When this
is over we sing the 5th Ode of the Canon of Great Thursday.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 5. Irmos</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>‘Bound with the bond of love, the Apostles offered themselves to Christ the
Master of all things; when their beautiful feet had been washed clean they bring
good tidings of peace to all.’</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>The Wisdom of God that restrains the ungovernable upper water in the air,
bridles the deeps and holds back the sea, pours water in a basin; the Master
washes the feet of servants.</p>
<p>The Master shows his Disciples a model of humility; he who wraps the sky in
clouds girds himself with a towel and bends the knee to wash the feet of
servants; in his hand is the breath of all that is.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Then are sung the Idiomels of the Washing. Tone 1.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>As you girded yourself with a towel and washed your Disciples’ feet,
washing away the filth from our souls and gird us round with a spiritual bond,
to do your commands and sing the praise of your goodness.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Tone 2.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>About to enjoy a great grace, let us the faithful devoutly run together to
the honoured Washing, not washing away the stain of the flesh, but spiritually
sanctifying our souls; for Christ our Saviour, who looks upon the earth and
makes and makes it tremble, bows himself down and touches feet of clay, granting
safe walking upon every hostile power. To him let us cry aloud with
thanksgiving: As you showed us the best road to exaltation, humility, save us,
good Lord, as you love humankind.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Same Tone.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Peter was loathe for his feet to be washed by the spotless hands by which
Adam had been fashioned. But when he heard, ‘Unless I wash you, you have no
part with me’, seized with great fear, he cried to you, O Lord, ‘Do not wash
only my feet, but also my hands and my head’. O how great are the Master’s
gifts! He makes his own Disciples sharers in grace and promises that to have a
part with them in ineffable glory, as he also said over the mystic cup, that he
would drink it new with them in the Kingdom of heaven. Make us worthy of it too,
as you are merciful and love humankind.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Tone 8.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Today the one who is by nature unapproachable took up the work of a slave. He
who wraps the heavens with clouds, girded himself with a towel. He who divided
the Red Sea, poured water for a washing; and bending his knees, he began to wash
the feet of the Disciples and to dry them with the towel with which he had been
girded. Then, having washed the Disciples’ feet, he said to them, ‘You are
clean, but not all’, meaning the one who was betraying him.</p>

<p>At that time, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his
hands and that he had come forth from God and was going back to God, rises from
supper and lays aside his outer garments; and taking a towel he ties it round
his waist. Then he puts water in the basin and began to wash the disciples’
feet and wipe them with the towel which was tied round his waist. He comes to
Simon Peter, who says to him, ‘Lord, are you going to wash my feet?’ Jesus
answered and said to him, ‘What I am doing you do not understand now, but you
will understand later.’ Peter says to him, ‘You shall never wash my feet.’
Jesus answered him, ‘Unless I wash you, you have no part in me.’ Peter says
to him, ‘Lord, not only my feet, but my hands and my head also.’ Jesus says
to him, ‘One who has washed has no need except to wash their feet, but they
are wholly clean. And you are clean, but not all of you.’ For he knew the one
who would betray him; that is why he said, ‘You are not all clean.’</p>
