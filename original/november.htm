<p>They were from Asia, and their father was a pagan. After his death, their Christ-loving
mother now having found freedom, brought them up devoutly and taught them every form of
virtue and knowledge, in particular medicine. They took this up as their profession and
went around every disease and weakness, giving their cures without payment both to all
humans and also to animals, hence they were given the epithet &#145;Unmercenaries&#146;.
In this way they completed the course of their lives and died in peace.</font></p>

<font face="Book Antiqua">

<p>They drew many unbelievers to the faith of Christ; they were denounced to the count of
the city, Livanios, by whom, after many other torments, they were immured alive into a
tomb, and so handed their spirits into the hands of God. The ascetic was born in Bithynia,
around the year 740; his father was named Myritikes, his mother Anastaso, and from his
early manhood he served as a soldier and was found worthy of royal honours for his
courage. Later he came to despise them all and left for Mt Olympus, where he passed the
rest of life as an ascetic, and having become mighty in virtue, he fell asleep in the Lord
in 834, having lived for all of 94 years. His is the brief prayer: &#145;The Father is my
hope,&#146; etc.</font></p>

<p>He was a son of Kleitophon and Lefkippi, who at first had both been pagans, but were
later taught the true faith by a certain Christian, named Onouphrios. Epistimi was also

<p>A native of Thessaloniki, he was first a priest and then bishop of the Church of
Constantinople; a distinguished man, generous, upright for things of God, witnessing by

valiant champion of the faith in the Homoousios until death. But he was on two occasions
exiled from his throne by the arianising Emperor Constantius, son of Constantine the
Great, finally he was exiled around 350 to Koukousos in Armenia, where at the instigation
of the Arians, those who were taking him into exile throttled him.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="GabrMich.gif" width="201" height="265" alt="GabrMich.gif (65466 bytes)" border="2"></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua">

<p>All the Angels, according to the Apostle Paul, are ministering spirits, sent out for
those who are to inherit salvation [Heb. 1:14]. God has established them as guardians over
every nation and people, and as guides for what is good [Lev. 32:8]. He orders them to
guard those who hope in him, that nothing may harm them, that no evil may draw near their
dwellings [Ps. 6:9-14]. In heaven they look continually on the face of God, as they sing
to him the thrice-holy hymn and intercede before him on our behalf, as they likewise also
rejoice over one sin who repents [Is. 6:2-3; Mt. 18:10; Lk. 15:7; Acts 12:15]. In a word
they serve God for our benefit in so many ways that the pages of the holy Scriptures are
full of accounts of them.</p>

<p>Therefore the orthodox Church, gratefully honouring these divine ministers and our
protectors and guardians, ordains to-day this present assembly, that is our gathering for
their common feast and praise; but especially of the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, as
they are mentioned by name in the Scriptures. Michael means &#145;Who is as God?&#146;,
while Gabriel means &#145;Power of God&#146;. The number of the Angels is not defined by
holy Scripture, though Daniel says thousands upon thousands minister to God and ten
thousands upon ten thousands stand before him [7:10]. Nevertheless they are all divided
into nine ranks called: Thrones, Cherubim, Seraphim, Dominions, Powers, Authorities,
Principalities, Archangels and Angels.</font></p>

<p>9. Of the holy martyrs Onesiphoros and Porphyrios; and of our venerable mother Matrona;
and of our Father among the Saints Nekatarios of Pentapolis.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua">

<p>The martyrs suffered under Diocletian and Maximianos in the year 290. The ascetic was
from Perge in Pamphylia and flourished around 466; she had been married to a husband and
had a daughter by him; after her husband&#146;s death she entrusted her to a certain wise
woman, while she herself ended her life ascetically. She lived to be almost a hundred..
Saint Nektarios was from Selyvria in Thrace, and was devoted to God from childhood. When
he had been carefully educated he was consecrated Metropolitan of Pentapolis in Egypt. He
came to Greece and passed his life in virtue, wisdom and the other precepts of the Gospel.
By divine counsel he founded the women&#146;s monastery of the Holy Trinity in Aegina,
where he spent the rest of his life in holiness and virtue, in constant prayer and
humility. He fell asleep in 1920. In the same monastery, which already bears his name, are
preserved his sacred relics, which ineffably give off a sweet fragrance and are the source
of numerous wonders.</font></p>

<p>Of these Olympas and Rhodion, or Herodion [Rom. 16:11], followed Peter the prince of

in peace, having become bishops, Sosipater of Iconium, Quartus of Beirut, Erastes of
Paneas or Paneias (which was renamed Caesarea Philippi), he had been appointed treasurer
of the Church in Corinth [Rom. 16:22]. The martyr was from Tyana in Cappadocia in the time
of Diocletian. Holes were bored in his ankles by long nails, he was bound to a wild horse,

<p>11. Of the holy martyrs Menas, Victor and Vincent; and of the holy Martyr Stephanis;
and of our venerable Father Theodore the Studite.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua">

<p>Menas was an Egyptian who suffered in Kotyaeios in Phrygia in 296 under Diocletian and
Maximianos; Victor and Stephanis in Italy in 160 under Antonius; Vincent in Spain in 235
under Maximinus.</p>

<p>Theodore the Studite was born in Constantinople in 759 of devout parents, Photeinos and
Theoctisti; from his youth he was clothed in the monastic schema in the monastery known as
that of Sakkodion, of which he became abbot in 794 (having been ordained deacon and priest
around 784 by the most holy patriarch Tarasios). Later he transferred to the monastery of
Studios, so called because it had been founded by Studios, a Roman consul, and he received
the epithet &#145;Studite&#146;. He appeared as a fervent zealot for the traditions of the
fathers; he fought till his death for the honour of the holy icons; he endured exile on
three occasions because of his zeal for the true faith. On the third occasion he was
condemned by the iconoclast Emperor Leo the Armenian; he endured nobly, being beaten and
bound and being transferred from one gloomy dungeon to another even more stygian, for
seven whole years. Finally he was recalled from exile by Michael Travlos, and after a
short respite from his long labours he rested in the Lord on November 11th, 826, on a
Sunday, when his disciples were kneeling round him and singing the &#145;Blameless&#146;.
Some say that he himself, after receiving the spotless mysteries, began to sing this
psalm; but that when he reached the verse: &#145;I shall not forget your judgements for
ever, for by them you have made me live&#146; (118:93), he expired, at the age of 67.
Among his many other sacred writings he composed, with the co-operation of his own brother
Joseph, almost the whole of the book, full of compunction, the Triodion (Cf. also July
14th).</font></p>

asked that an infant be brought from the market-place, that it might be the judge of the
proposed idea. When the infant was asked: Which God should one worship? it answered: The
God of the Christians. It was then mercilessly flayed on the tyrant&#146;s orders and then
its head was struck off. The martyr had his tongue cut out and was thrown into goal,

there and the fame of his spiritual struggles was heard of everywhere and the fair

the holy ikons under Constantine Copronymos, by whom he was first condemned to eleven
months in chains and prison, then he was dragged down on the ground and stoned like the
proto-martyr Stephen, from whom Stephen the New was named. He was struck with wood against
his membrane of his brain, and, when his head had been crushed, he gave up his spirit in

for the punishment of the holy martyrs. But once, while watching seven women being
tortured for Christ and marvelling at their courage, because, though feeble by nature,
they were most courageous against the tyrant and put him to shame, he was enlightened by

<p>He was from Bethsaida in Galilee, son of Jonas, brother of the prince of Apostles
Peter, disciple at first of John the Baptist. Then, having heard his testimony concerning
Jesus, when he pointed to him and said, &#145;See, the lamb of God, who takes away the sin
of the world&#146; (John 1,36), he followed Jesus at once and became his first disciple,
from he he was given the title &#145;First-called&#146; of the Apostles. After the
Saviour&#146;s assumption, he preached him in many places and suffered much for his name.
He died in Patras in Achaia, being crucified head downwards.</font></p>
