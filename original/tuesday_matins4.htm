<p>The casket of your relics blazes with beams of divine grace more than the
rays of the sun; it makes radiant the hearts and resplendent the souls of those
who with faith sing your praise, O Champions.</p>

<p>See, the beauty of your house is known as heaven on earth, Forerunner of
Christ; coming to it you shine with godlike rays on those who in it each day now
call you blessed.</p>
<p>As a true friend of the Master, all-blessed Baptist, hearten me to love him
with upright and unwavering intent, and utterly to abhor the devastating
passions that impel men to destruction.</p>
<p>Wise Saint, you were not born as a reed shaken by hostile winds, but as our
divine support and unshakeable buttress of the Church. By your prayers keep her
unmoved, making an end of every stumbling block.</p>
<p>The coming of the Creator is at the doors. Why then, wretched soul, do you
not grieve for yourself, but live neglectfully? Wake up! Cry to the Lord: Spare
me, O Saviour, at the prayers of the Forerunner, as you love humankind.</p>

shone from your womb and banished the dread darkness of deception. Therefore, as
is fitting, with faith we magnify you.</p>

<p>Alas, why have I been likened to the barren fig tree, and quail at the curse
with the felling? But Christ God, heavenly husbandman, make my parched soul
fruitful, and like the Prodigal Son accept me and have mercy on me.</p>
<p>Overlook the multitudes of my offences, Lord, born of a Virgin, and wiping
away all my iniquities, grant me the thought of returning, I beg, as you alone
love mankind, and have mercy on me.</p>

<p>The holy Martyrs struggled upon earth, they remained steadfast in the open
air, they were given up to fire, water received them; this was their cry: We
have passed through fire and water, and you have brought us to repose. At their
prayers, O God, have mercy on us.</p>
