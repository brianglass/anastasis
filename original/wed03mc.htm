<h2 align="center" class="style12">AT MATINS</h2>
<h2 class="style10"><span class="style13">After the 1st reading 
    from the Psalter Kathismata of the Cross.
Mode 3.</span><span class="style13"></span></h2>
<p class="style1">A Cross was fixed on earth and touched the heavens, not that the tree reached the heights, but you, who were on it, filled the universe. Lord, glory to you!
 <p class="style1">You were lifted up, Lamb of God, on cypress, pine and cedar, that you might save those who worship in faith your voluntary Cruci-fixion. Christ our God, glory to you!<p class=style10>
    <span class="style10">&nbsp;Glory. Both now.</span> <span class="style13">Cross-Theotokion.
    </span>
    <p class="style1">Having gained the Cross of your Son, O Mother of God, as a rod of power, with it we shall cast down the ramparts of the foes as with love we ceaselessly magnify you.
    <p class=style14>After the 2nd reading from the Psalter others.
    <p class=style1>You were struck with blows for the sake of the human race and were not enraged; free our life from corruption, Lord, and save us.
    <p class="style1"4>Τὴν ὡραιότητα. Awed by the beauty.
    <p class="style1">The armies of the Angels are amazed as they contemplate your measureless authority and your voluntary Crucifixion: How is He who cannot be looked at scourged in the flesh? He wishes to de-liver human nature from corruption, and so we cry out to 
    you, Giver of life: Glory, O Christ, to your compassion!<p class="style10">
    Glory, Both now. <span class="style10"><span class="style13">Cross Theotokion. Same melody</span>.</span>
    <p class="style1">Your pure Mother who knew not wedlock, seeing you hanging dead upon the Tree, mourned as a mother and said, ‘Is this how the lawless and ungrateful people of the Hebrews, who had the benefit of your  many and great gifts, have repaid you, my Son? I hymn your divine condescension.’
    <p class="style14">After the 3rd reading from the Psalter others.<p class="style14">Τὴν ὡραιότητα. Awed by the beauty.
    <p class=style1>Dishonoured you endured the Cross, O Master beyond all creation, that you might honour me, of old dreadfully dishonoured; with a lance you were pierced in your side, O Longsuffering, as you wished to ransom me, your fashioning, from corruption. I hymn your great compassion and your goodness, O Lover of humankind.<p class="style1">&nbsp;Of the Martyrs.
Armoured with the panoply of Christ and clothed with the weap-ons of the Faith you stoutly cast down the battle lines of the foe; for eagerly, in hope of life, you endured all the threats and scourges of the tyrants; and so you have received the crowns, valiant Martyrs of Christ.<p class="style10">Glory. Both now.<span 
            class="style13"> Cross-Theotokion. Same melody.</span>
            <p class="style1">As your Mother, the pure and all blameless Virgin who knew not wedlock, saw you nailed to the Tree, O Master, she cried aloud to you, ‘Alas, my sweetest Son, how has a lawless people condemned you, the Maker and Master of all, to the tree? I hymn your supreme goodness.
            <p class="style10"><span class="style13">Canon of the Cross, whose acrostic is:</span>
By toils you ended mortals toils, O Word. Joseph.<p class="style1"4>Ode 1. Tone 3. The Irmos.<p class="style1">He who of old assembled the waters into one gathering 
    by divine decree and divided the sea for the people of Israel, he our God is glorified; to him alone let us sing, for he has been glorified.
    <p class="style1"4>Troparia.<p class="style1">You ended painful passions, O Word, by the passion of your pre-cious flesh, and saved mortals, whom the opponent had wounded of old, mortals who venerate your incomprehensible dispensation.
    <p class="style1">He who by deception bound mankind in Paradise by transgression of the commandment, has been bound, Lord, with the indissoluble bonds with which you were willingly bound in body, loosing our offence, O Lover of humankind.
    <p class="style1"4>Of  the Martyrs.<p class="style1">The famed Champions, seeing creation being shipwrecked by the deceptions of the demons, appeared as fair havens, drowning all the power of the avenger in the red sea of their blood.<p class="style1">The choir of the Martyrs, clearly united with the choirs above, is ever surrounded by the rays of the uncreated Godhead, and shines on those on earth who with faith glorify their wonders.
    <p class="style1"4>Cross-Theotokion.<p class="style1">You appeared higher than the Hosts on high, O Immaculate, who bore God the Word on earth, who through his goodness by his Passion and Cross has made us mount to heaven.<p class="style1">Another, of the Mother of God, of which the acrostic is:
I bring a third song to the Mother of God.<p class="style1"4>Another Irmos.
<p class="style1">With the sprinkling of the divine stream which was emptied from the divine side of your Son, Pure Lady, wash the bruises of my heart, that I may magnify you and, as is fitting, glorify you as ever blest and all blameless.<p class="style1">You bore the Word, equal in power to his Begetter and who makes the being of mortals divine; but ask him, O Pure One, to grant me, in despair and made weak by the wiles of the foe, divine consolation.<p class="style1"4>&nbsp;Ode 3. The Irmos.
<p class=style1>Almighty and Most High, who brings all things from non-existence, created by the Word and perfected by the Spirit, estab-lish me in your love.<p class=style14>Troparia.
<p class=style1>The people of the Hebrews put you to death, who by the impassi-ble nature of the Godhead became passible in the flesh through your goodness and make us immortal.
<p class=style1>O Word, who hung the earth upon the waters, by your will you were hung upon a tree, leading me up to heavenly things who had fallen into the deeps of wickedness.
<p class=style14>&nbsp;Of the Martyrs.<p class=style1>Embellished with the marks of Christ, all praised Martyrs, you stand before the Lord, receiving from his rich hand your rewards.
<p class=style1>With joyful soul the Saints ran towards torments, causing extreme grief to the dragon and joining the choirs of Angels.
<p class=style14>Cross-Theotokion.<p class=style1>Bride who knew not wedlock, seeing Christ suspended on the Cross, grieving you said, ’You have set, O Sun of glory, from my sight, enlightening those in darkness.
<p class=style14>Of the Mother of God. The same Irmos.<p class=style1>All-holy, you are merciful, ask him who is rich in ineffable mercy and pity to take on us who are afflicted.
<p class=style1>You, the dwelling of the Maker of all, implore that the Advocate may dwell in me who have become a den of soul destroying thieves, pure Virgin.
<p class=style1>Mother of God, as you bear in your embrace him who bears all things by his divine inclination, incline to me and deliver me from my foul inclination to the passions.
<p class=style14>Ode 4. The Irmos<p class=style1>You have shown us mighty love, O Lord, for you gave your only begotten Son to death for our sakes; and so we cry to you in thanksgiving: Glory to your power, O Lord!
<p class=style14>Troparia.
<p class=style1>O Master Christ, who are above all honour, truly you endured out-rage, being struck on the head with a reed, that you might honour me who had become dishonoured through transgression, O Lover of humankind.
<p class=style1>Willingly you were bound with a crown of thorns, O Longsuffer-ing, as true King, and you put an end to thorn-bearing sin by the roots; I confess your sufferings, O Saviour.
<p class=style14>Of the Martyrs.<p class=style1>You remained unbroken by the pains of torments, O Martyrs, breaking the deception of the foe and placing him beneath your feet as he boasted wildly and expired completely from lack of breath.
<p class=style1>&nbsp;Incorruptible bodies you gained divine incorruption, stoutly imi-tating by your sufferings the Passion of the Impassible, all praised Martyrs, numbered with all the Bodiless Powers.
<p class=style14>Cross-Theotokion.
<p class=style1>The Prophet once saw you, O Maiden, as a book in which the Word incarnate was inscribed by the finger of the Father, and with a lance he tears up the record of the Forefather, O Immaculate.
<p class=style14>Of the Mother of God. The same Irmos.
<p class=style1>As you willingly endured bruises and slaughter, O Christ, heal my soul bruised by the thieving malice of demons, at the intercessions of her who bore you, O Most Merciful.
<p class=style1>I am the work and creation of your hands, O Creator, but by the wickedness of the serpent I have been smashed by the pleasures of life, O Christ; and so refashion me at the entreaties of her who bore you.
<p class=style1>&nbsp;Beyond reason you gave birth to the Word of the Father who loosed mortals from all unreason; earnestly entreat him to free me, who am enslaved to irrational passions, O only Ever-Virgin.
At every moment you pour healing from your hand, who are wholly the tabernacle of sanctification, wholly filled with light, wholly letting fall drops of the myrrh of sweet fragrance, All-pure Bride of God.
<p class=style14>Ode 5. The Irmos.<p class=style1>You, the Invisible, appeared on earth and willingly you the Incom-prehensible dwelt among mortals; and so rising to you at dawn we hymn you, Lover of humankind.
<p class=style14>Troparia.<p class=style1>Like a lamb you were suspended on a tree and were offered as a sacrifice to the Father for our sake, O Good One, and you brought to an end the sacrifices of idols, O All-powerful.
<p class=style1>Pierced in the side by the lance, O Giver of Life, you poured out two streams of salvation for those who proclaim you as one of the Trinity, who bear two modes of action.
<p class=style14>Of the Martyrs.<p class=style1>The doughty Champions found you by faith, O Jesu, as a firm foundation and unshakeable rock and on which they built them-selves as precious stones.
<p class=style1>Empowered by faith with the strength of God, O Martyrs, like champions you overthrew all the power of the deceiver and were radiantly crowned.
<p class=style14>Theotokion.<p class=style1>Our nature which before had changed through transgression you, All-holy Lady, protection of our souls, as she who without change bore Christ, have refashioned.
<p class=style14>Of the Mother of God. Another Irmos.
<p class=style1>Transform the pains of my flesh and the toil of my soul, and dispel the clouds of sloth, O Virgin, cloud of light, and give health in ex-change for troubles to me who ask and glorify you with love.
<p class=style1>I who am full of every sin put you forward as mediator and advo-cate with him who was born of you; O Virgin be at my side and be the righter of my life, leading me by the hand to the paths of knowledge of God.
<p class=style1>Sanctify my mind and lead my soul to light, O Virgin, and make me a partaker of divine glory; for see, I am filled with evils and have become enslaved to every kind of pleasure, and I bring for-ward a sullied conscience.
<p class=style14>Ode 6. The Irmos.
<p class=style1>A final abyss of sins has closed round me and my spirit fails; but stretch out your uplifted arm, O Master and Pilot, and save as you saved Peter.
<p class=style14>Troparia.
<p class=style1>The trickster serpent led me out of Eden, tricking me with a trick of eating; but Christ, suspended on a tree by his own will, gives me back the ancient entry.
<p class=style1>The one who wounded us has been wounded by your wounded side, and remains incurable, O Lord our Benefactor; but we the faithful have been cured by the bruises with which you were will-ingly wounded.
<p class=style14>Of the Martyrs.
<p class=style1>You appeared as wise in the midst of fire, Foot Soldiers of Christ, roasted like lambs and served on the table of God the universal sovereign, and inheriting ineffable gladness.
<p class=style1>Drawing from inexhaustible treasuries, distribute rivers of healings and dry up the experience of the passions and water the gatherings of the faithful.
<p class=style14>Cross-Theotokion.
<p class=style1>Seeing the death of the Word who became incarnate of your blood, All-Blameless, you bewailed him as a mother and magnified him as the cause of life, O Lady, Virgin-Mother.
<p class=style14>Of the Mother of God. Another Irmos.

    <p class=style1>I have exceeded the puffed up mind of the Pharisee, ever giving myself airs and plunging into the deeps of unnumbered falls; O only pure one, take pity on me who have been terribly humbled.<p class=style1>Your conceiving and your giving birth were beyond wonder. Now show me in my wretchedness the wonder of your mercies; for in lawlessness conceived and born, I have become enslaved to pleas-ures.<p class=style1>I lament and weep and mourn whenever I consider that dread judgement seat; for I have acquired evil deeds; Virgin Mother of God, who knew not man, stand up for me in that fearful hour.<p class=style1>Ode 7. The Irmos.<p class=style1>The three Youths of old did not worship the golden image, object of Persian reverence as they sang in the midst of the furnace: God of our Fathers, blessed are you!
    <p class=style14>Troparia.
    <p class=style1>By your toils you ended our toils, Lover of humankind; so now take over to a life without toil those who devoutly worship your holy sufferings, O God of all.
    <p class=style1>When creation saw you crucified it was altered and trembled: earth was shaken, rocks were rent and the sun’s course drew away the light.
    <p class=style14>Of the Martyrs.
    <p class=style1>Obedient to the laws of Christ the Martyrs laid low the flatteries of the lawless and lawfully in the midst of the stadium they struggled and were gloriously crowned.
    <p class=style1>You were not burnt up by the flame of fire but obtained a more fer-vent purpose,  champions of Christ, and bearing crowns you cried: O God, blessed are you!
    <p class=style14>Theotokion.
    <p class=style1>You stood watching Christ, whom you had borne, lifted up on the Cross, O Immaculate, and you cried: Do not make me childless, whom you preserved pure‚ even after childbirth
    <p class=style1>&nbsp;[<span class="style13">Cross-Theotokion.</span>
When at the judgement seat of Christ I am about to be judged, ap-pear as my defender, delivering me from every torment by your fervent intercession.]
<p class=style14>This is wrong, and does not fit the acrostic.
<p class=style14>Of the Mother of God. Another Irmos.
<p class=style1>There is no salvation for me from my works, Sovereign Lady, for I have added sins to sins and wickedness to wickedness; by your prayer then, pure Virgin, take pity and save me.
<p class=style1>The judgement is at the doors, the judgement seat is ready; get ready, my lowly soul, and cry: When you judge me, O Word, at the prayer of her who bore you, do not condemn me.
<p class=style1>I devoured the fruits of sin and I have met my death; and as I bring a fruitless soul I cry to you: Make me fruitful, for you wiped out corruption by your fruit.
<p class=style14>Ode 8. The Irmos.
<p class=style1>Babylonian furnace did not burn the Youths, nor the fire of the Godhead destroy the Virgin; and so with the Youths let us believ-ers cry: Bless the Lord, works of the Lord!
<p class=style14>Troparia.
<p class=style1>When you were crucified Paradise was opened again, and the sword that was turned against us withdrew, fearing the lance which had pierced your holy side, O Christ, most merciful.
<p class=style1>The enemy was wounded by your lance and fell, while fallen Adam was brought back crying out to you, O Christ, who were willingly slain: Blessing, I glorify you, God most merciful!
<p class=style14>Of the Martyrs.
<p class=style1>The world is made radiant by your struggles and your deeds of valour, O Athletes, and by your infinite wonders, and is delivered from the darkness of diseases as it cries: Bless the Lord works of the Lord.
<p class=style1>He who of old boasted of obliterating land and sea appears a laughing stock, lying at your feet, O Saints; while Christ with his life bearing right hand adorns you, All revered, with unfading crowns.
<p class=style14>&nbsp;Theotokion.
<p class=style1>The One who is above time you bore in time, who looses the time-less bonds of Adam the first formed by his bonds, O Immaculate, and bound him to himself with the bonds of his sweet love.
<p class=style14>Of the Mother of God. Another Irmos.
<p class=style1>As wholly fair and neighbour to the Universal King, O Mother of God, fill me with good works, for I have lived in wickedness and passed through my whole life in sloth, that I may glorify you to all the ages.
<p class=style1>As you snatched the Prophet marvellously from the belly of the whale of old, O Word of God, so deliver my soul, which has slipped down into a deep of destruction, O Saviour, for you have to implore you the Virgin who gave you birth without wedlock.
<p class=style1>The workers of wickedness, finding that I had been clothed with a fair robe by the birth of God, stripped me naked of it; but do you, O Virgin, by your prayers make me radiant with godlike robes through repentance
<p class=style14>Ode 9. The Irmos.
<p class=style1>The one who was prefigured in the bush and fire on Sinai to the law giver Moses and who conceived in her womb the divine fire unburned, the lamp all light and unquenchable, who is truly the Mother of God, in hymns let us honour and magnify.
<p class=style14>Troparia.
<p class=style1>That you might find the drachma you had lost, O Christ, you fixed your flesh to the Cross and you make us partakers with your Pow-ers above, O Giver of life, with whom, as we hymn you as benefac-tor, in songs we magnify you.
<p class=style1>As you lifted up your hands on the Cross, O Christ, you pulled up by your power my hands enfeebled of old by many passions, and you gave strength to my weakened knees for the godly course; and so we magnify you.
<p class=style14>Of the Martyrs.
<p class=style1>Burned by the flame of limitless torments, the brave and wondrous Athletes found you, O Christ, as a refreshing dew; therefore rejoic-ing they completed their course with their desire for prizes, as in hymns they unceasingly magnify you.
<p class=style1>The multitude of the Athletes and the choir of the Saints implore you, O Christ, on behalf of a people and nation who have much embittered you, to wipe away in the multitude of your mercy, O Pitying One, the multitudes of our offences, as you love mankind.
<p class=style14>Cross-Theotokion.
<p class=style1>O Virgin, you bore the Brightness of the Father, bearing a mortal form; the sun not able to bear seeing him raised on the Cross, grew black and the fog of the folly of idols was worsted; therefore with him we magnify you.
<p class=style14>Of the Mother of God. Another Irmos.
<p class=style1>My mind is corrupted, my soul is corrupted, with wickedness I have been fouled in my conscience and I have been exposed as na-ked of any sort of goodness; but Virgin, blameless and incorrupt, do not despise me, but adorn me with works of true religion.
<p class=style1>I am filed with wickedness, I am filled with thoughts that alienate me from you, Lover of mankind; and so I groan and cry: At the prayers of her who gave you birth receive me as I repent and do not reject me, Benefactor great in mercy.
<p class=style1>May I be delivered by your prayers, all blameless Maiden, from all wrath, from death bringing passions, harsh Hades and fire, from un-just men, from evil foes; I who run to your protection and call on you for help.
<p class=style1>As Mother of God implore the Lord, God and King, who was born of you, that you suppliant may be delivered from every threat and evil habit, for from my mother’s womb I have trusted in you, pure Lady.
<p class=style14>Aposticha of Lauds, of the Cross.
<p class=style1>Through jealousy I was cast out from delight and fell in a harsh fall; you did not disdain, Master, to assume for me that which was mine and to crucify it, and you save me, you lead me into glory. My Redeemer, glory to you!
<p class=style1>On the mountain Moses by stretching out his hands on high in the form of a Cross routed Amalek, while you, O Saviour, opening your palms on the Cross, took me in your embrace and saved me from the slavery of the foe; and you gave me the mark of life to flee from the bow of my enemies; therefore, O Word, I worship your precious Cross.
<p class=style14>Of the Martyrs.
<p class=style1>Having fought the good fight, holy Martyrs, after death also you shine out like beacons in the world; and so, as you have boldness, implore Christ to have mercy on our souls.
<p class=style15>Glory, Both now. <span class="style13">Cross-Theotokion.</span>
<p class=style1>Seeing you hanging on the tree, my Christ, supremely good, the All-blameless lamented and cried out as a mother: my Son so greatly loved, how has the lawless nation condemned you to the tree?
