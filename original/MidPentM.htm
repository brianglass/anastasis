</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Christ, the Messias, mid the teachers stands,<br>
And teaches at the mid-point of the feast.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>We celebrate this feast in honour of the two great feasts, of Pascha, I mean, and
Pentecost, as it unites and binds them both. It occurred in this way. After Christ had
performed the supernatural wonder on the Paralytic, the Jews, scandalized indeed because
of the Sabbath (for it took place on the Sabbath), sought to kill him. He therefore fled
to Galilee, and as he was sojourning on the mountains there, he performed the marvel of
the five loaves and two fishes, nourishing five thousand men, not counting women and
children. Afterwards at the feast of Tabernacles (this too is a great feast for the Jews)
he went up to Jerusalem and went about in secret. About the mid-point of the feast he went
up into the Temple and began to teach, and all were amazed at his teaching; but being
envious of him they said: How does this man know letters, never having learned? For being
the New Adam he knew, being filled with all wisdom as the first one, and again because he
was God. Therefore they all murmured and we for slaying him. But Christ confused them,
acting as though they were contending about the Sabbath, and said: Why do you seek to kill
me? But he again referred to what had gone before, saying: If you contend for the Law, why
are angry at me? Because I made a man whole on the Sabbath, when Moses who laid down the
law on these things says that it is to be set aside for the sake of circumcision. He
argued with them at length over this and showed that he himself had given the Law and that
he was equal with the Father. And especially on the last day of the feast he was stoned by
them; but not a single stone so much as touched him. And when he was passing by from there
he found the man born blind and gave him his sight.</p>

<p>Know that there are three great feasts among the Jews. The first is the Passover, which
is celebrated in the first month and commemorates the crossing of the Red Sea. The second
is Pentecost, which remembers the sojourning in the wilderness, after the crossing of the
Red Sea; for they passed fifty days in the wilderness until they received the Law from
Moses. It is also in honour of the number seven, which is held in reverence by them.</p>

<p>The third feast is that of Tabernacles, in memory of the Tabernacle which Moses saw in
the cloud on the mountain and which he erected through the craftsman Beseleel. It is also
celebrated for seven days in memory of the gathering of fruits and the repose in the
wilderness. It was then, as this feast was drawing to its end that Jesus stood and cried
with a loud voice: If any thirst, let him come to me and drink!</p>

<p>Since then by this teaching Christ declared himself to be the Messiah, becoming our
Mediator and Reconciler with his eternal Father. For this reason we celebrate the present
feast and naming it &#145;Mid-Pentecost&#146; we hymn Christ and place alongside the
honour of the other two great feasts. This, I think, is why the feast of the Samaritan
Woman is celebrated after it: because that feast also has much to do with the Messiah, and
with water and with thirst, as this one. For in the Gospel of John that of the Blind man
rather precedes the Samaritan Woman.</font></p>

<p>Daniel, stretching out his hands, shut up the mouths of lions in the den, while the
Youths, lovers of piety and clothed in virtue, quenched the power of fire, as they cried:
All you works of the Lord, bless the Lord!</font></p>

<p>In beauty you rose from the tomb, Lord, adorned in the glory of your Godhead, and
appeared to your Apostles, promising to send the force of the Spirit to them as they
cried: All you works, praise the Lord!</p>

<p>Having slain Hell as God, supreme source of life, you became for all a source of
eternal life, which the graces of these brilliant days now most clearly resemble for those
who cry: All you works, praise the Lord!</p>

<p>Showing your rays, O Christ, as sun of justice, you sent out your Apostles to the
world, bearing you, the light ineffable, dispelling the fog of ignorance and crying: All
you works, praise the Lord!</font></p>

<p>Come, peoples, see the one who is hymned upon a throne of glory blasphemed by lawless
peoples, and seeing, hymn the Messias who was foretold by the prophets.</p>

<p>You are truly the Christ who is coming into the world, from whom are salvation and
forgiveness of ancestral faults; you are the true life of those who believe in you.</p>

<p>The Wisdom of God, so it is written, came to the temple at the mid-point of the feast
and taught; for he was truly the Messias, Christ, from whom is salvation.</p>

<p>On the Sabbath, and on all days, Christ showed the works of the signs, healing
completely the sick from divers diseases; but the erring people bore grudging anger.</p>

<p>This man, it says, cured the Paralytic, who had been lying sick for many years, on the
Sabbath, and so transgressed the Law. Thus the Jews bitterly reviled Christ.</p>

<p>Did not Moses, who gave you the law, not command you to be circumcised? And he
circumcised a man on the Sabbath, that the law of the fathers might in no way be
abolished, says Christ to the Jews.</p>

<p>The ever ungrateful, who of old dwelt in the desert, enviously begrudged their
benefactor, blaspheming, wagging their tongues and meditating vain things</font></p>

<p>At the mid-point of the feast of the Jews you came, my Saviour, to your temple, and you
taught all: but the Jews marvelled, and said: Whence does this man know letters, never
having learned?</p>

<p>Pouring out gifts of healings, my Redeemer performed signs and wonders, banishing
diseases, healing the sick; but the Jews were maddened by the multitude of his wonders.</p>

<p>My Redeemer confounding the unbelieving Jews cried out: Do not judge by appearances;
but judge just judgement: for the Law orders every man to be circumcised even on the
Sabbath.</p>

<p>You granted your Disciples greater marvels, O Saviour, as you had promised, when you
sent them to proclaim your glory to the nations: while they began to proclaim to the world
your Resurrection, your grace and your incarnation.</p>

<p>If you circumcise a man on the Sabbath, yet the law is in no way violated; why do you
upbraid me because I made a man whole with a word? You judge according to the flesh, says
Christ to the Jews.</p>

<p>O Word, who cured the withered hand with a word, cure the long withered land of my
heart, and make me fruitful, that I too, Saviour, may produce fruits by fervent
repentance.</p>

<p>Purify my leprous heart, O Word, and give light to the eyes of my soul; stand me
upright, who am lying on a bed of pain, as you raised the Paralytic as he lay on his bed.</p>

<p>The Lord Messias silenced the scribes and confounded the Jews when he cried to them:
Lawless ones, do not, as unjust, judge by appearances. For on the Sabbath I raised the
Paralytic: therefore I am Lord of the Sabbath and the Law. Why do you seek to slay me, who
raise the dead?</p>

<p>The fierce and lawless, the ungrateful assembly of the Jews, stoned Moses, sawed Isaias
