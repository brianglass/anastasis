<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="7">MONTH OF SEPTEMBER</font></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">It has 30 days. The day
has 12 hours and the night 12 hours.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">1.</font><font face="Book Antiqua"> </font><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Beginning of the Indiction, that is of the New Year.</font><font face="Book Antiqua"> Commemoration of our venerable father Symeon the Stylite; assembly of
the Mother of God of the Miasini. Commemoration of the martyr Aithalas, and of the forty
holy women and of Ammoun, the deacon and their teacher, and of the holy martyrs Kallisti,
Evodos and Hermogenes, sister and brothers. Commemoration of Jesus the just, son of Navi;
and memorial of the great fire.</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">THE BEGINNING OF THE INDICTION. The Roman Emperors,
for the maintenance of their troops, decreed through a constitution a certain general
tribute on their subjects by every eparchy, the payment of which took place yearly. The
same constitution was repeated after an interval of fifteen years, for the soldiers of Old
Rome had the obligation to serve in the army for fifteen years. After the completion of
these they renewed the constitution again, with some modification due to the probable
change of circumstances in the interval, and ordered afresh another tribute, to be paid
also in succession throughout the fifteen year period. At the end of this period a third,
and so forth. The imperial constitution, through which this tribute was ordered a little
before the winter, was named <i>Indictio</i>, that is &quot;decree&quot;, or
&quot;proclamation&quot; concerning the tribute. Writing it &quot;Indiction&quot; the
Kings of Constantinople preserved the word, while the patriarchs in later years employed
the word <i>epinemesis,</i> which means &quot;distribution&quot;. Indictions were
introduced, according to the commoner view under Augustus Caesar three years before
Christ, and they produce as proof a certain papal seal (<i>Bulla</i>), that is a papal
constitution, issued in the year 781 AD, which is dated as follows: <i>anno IV,
Indictionis LIII</i>, that is &quot;in year 4 of the 53rd Indiction&quot;, from which one
can conclude the year mentioned. By multiplying the 52 full Indictions and adding the 4
years of the 53rd one arrives at the number 784, that is 581 years from Christ and 3 more.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">There are three types of Indiction. The first is
that introduced in the West, which is called &quot;imperial&quot;, or
&quot;Caesarian&quot; or &quot;Constantinian&quot;, and it begins on the 24th of
September. The second is called &quot;papal&quot; and begins on the 1st of January. The
3rd, that of Constantinople, which the Patriarchs of that city adopted after the fall of
the Eastern Empire and which they write in their own hand on constitutions issued by them,
without numbering the succession of Indictions or of the periods of 15 years. It begins,
with a certain ceremony, from the 1st of September. And this is the &quot;Beginning of the
Indiction&quot;, and the reason for its cycle of fifteen years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">But since, after the gathering of the crops into
barns, there takes place in a certain manner the completion of the whole year, and we
begin again from this time and onwards to sow seed anew into the earth for the sake of the
provision of new produce in the future, for this reason September is reckoned to be the
beginning of the new year. The Church, as she celebrates today, asks of God
&quot;favourable weather&quot;, seasonable rains, &quot;abundance of the earth&quot; etc.
That the ancient Synagogue of the Jews also celebrated on this day the feast of Trumpets,
offering to God hymns of thanksgiving, holy Scripture is witness (Cf. Levit. 23:24-25.
Num. 29:1-2). There is a third reason for the present feast: the remembrance of the entry
of Jesus into the synagogue of the Jews at Nazareth, when he was given the book of the
Prophet Isaias to read, and opening it he found the passage where it was written:
&quot;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, therefore he has anointed me &quot;etc. (Luke
4:16-18). So much for the present feast and the Indiction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Of the Saints celebrated today Symeon was born about
the year 392 in a village called Sisan in the area of Cilicia and Syria. He entered the
monastic stadium from his youth. At first he was trained in a monastery, later by himself
in a desert place; and finally, opposite the mountains of Syria, he climbed onto a high
pillar, from which he was given the name &quot;Stylite&quot;. He persevered on this for
many years, standing upright for the most part. He lived in all for 69 years and died in
461.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Jesus, son of Navi, was of the tribe of Ephraim. He
was born in Egypt around the year 1654 BC He succeeded Moses in the 85th year of his age.
He held back the flow of the Jordan and made the Israelites cross over dryshod. When
making war on the Jebusites he halted the course of the sun. He partitioned the promised
land between the twelve tribes of Israelites and governed them for 25 years. He composed
the book which bears his name, the sixth book of the Old Testament. He lived in all 110
years and died in the year 1544 BC</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">The Great Fire took place in Constantinople,
according to some on the 2nd of September 461, according to others in 468.</font></p>

saints John the Faster, Patriarch of Constantinople.</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Mamas was from Gangra in Paphlagonia. He was born in
prison, where his parents died for the sake of Christ, and because he habitually called
his adoptive mother Ammia, &quot;Mama&quot;, he was named Mamas. He was martyred in 272 or
273. John the Faster was patriarch under Tiberius II, from the 12th of April 582 until the
2nd of September 595, having governed the Church for 13 years and almost five months.
Under his patriarchate the hitherto unaccustomed title &quot;Ecumenical Patriarch&quot;
was employed for the first time, by a certain local synod, about the year 586.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">4. Of the holy Bishop-martyr Babylas, patriarch of
Antioch; and of the holy Prophet Moses, who saw God.</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Babylas was the twelfth patriarch of Antioch and
successor to Zevinos or Zenovios. He was martyred under Decius around the year 250. Moses,
the loftiest of philosophers, wisest of lawgivers and most ancient of historians, was from
the tribe of Levi, son of Abraham and Jochabed. He was born in Egypt in the year 1689 BC
As a babe he was put into a basket, that is a box made out of papyrus and covered all over
with pitch. He was put onto the banks of the Nile because of the command and the fear of
Pharao. Taken from there by Pharao&#146;s daughter he became her adopted son and was
brought up in the royal court for 40 years. Fleeing from there to Madiam he saw at Mt
Horeb the vision of the burning bush, in about the 80th year of his life, when he was
appointed by God as leader of Israel, whom he led across the Red Sea as on dry land. He
governed Israel in the wilderness for forty years and performed many signs and marvels. He
composed the first five books of the Old Testament, which are called the Pentateuch.
Having reached the land of Moab he ascended Mt Nebo to its summit, which is called Phasga,
and there, by divine command, he died in the year 1569 BC, having lived in all for 120
years. His are the first two Odes from the Old Testament which are sung in the office: <i>Let
us sing to Lord</i>, etc., and <i>Attend, O heaven, and I will speak</i>, etc. The first
he sang by the shore of the Red Sea immediately after the crossing and the other in the
land of Moab a few days before his death.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">5. Of the holy Prophet Zachary, father of the honoured
Forerunner.</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">In the opinion of many in the Church, supported by
ancient tradition, the Jews murdered this Zachary, as the Lord said to them, between the
temple and the altar (Matt. 23:35) for two reasons: the first, that after the conception
by the Virgin Mary Zachary still called her &quot;Virgin&quot; and numbered her among the
virgins (Cf. St Basil, Sermon for Christ&#146;s Nativity). The other, that at the time of
the Slaughter of the Innocents (December 29th) his son John was not found, because the
aged Elizabeth took him, still a babe, and carefully concealed him, precisely where is
unknown, but certainly in the wilderness, where, according to the Gospel &quot;the child
grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his
revelation to Israel&quot; (Luke 1:80). When the child could not be found the father was
slain on the order of Herod (Cf. Peter of Alexandria, Canon 13).</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Clothed in the vestment of priesthood, wise Zachary, you
offered in a manner fitting a priest acceptable whole burnt offerings according to the Law
of God; and you became a beacon and one who contemplated mysteries, manifestly bearing in
yourself, O all-wise, the symbols of grace. Slain by the sword in God&#146;s temple,
Prophet of Christ intercede, with the Forerunner, that our souls may be saved.</font></big></p>

Bishop-martyr Cornelius the Centurion.</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">This Church, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which
is especially honoured by all the faithful, is the one which Constantine the Great erected
on the site of Golgotha, where the Saviour was crucified and buried. A long time ago it
was purposely obliterated by the Jews and pagans, while under Hadrian Aelius a pagan
shrine of Aphrodite was erected on the site, for the greater desecration and total
obliteration of the sacred spot. Here too the precious Cross was hidden; but after
excavations had taken place on the order of the devout Emperor, the symbols of the saving
passion were discovered. On this site then there was built a very large and outstandingly
beautiful church dedicated to the life-bearing Resurrection of Christ our God, under the
direction of the blessed Helen, of Drakilianos, the governor of Palestine, and Makarios,
the then patriarch of Jerusalem, who elevated the precious Cross (September 14) and
celebrated the dedication of this church about the year 330.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Cornelius was Roman by birth, pagan by religion,
centurion by rank. He lived in Caesarea in Palestine, a man devout and godfearing, giving
many alms to the people and praying to God at all times. About the year 41 he saw a vision
of an angel and sent and invited the Apostle Peter from Joppa, by whom he was instructed
in belief in Christ and was baptised with all his household. He was the first fruits of
the pagans. It is said that after this he was appointed bishop, according to some of
Caesarea itself, according to others of Skepsis not far from the Troad, and that he died a
martyr&#146;s death.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">The blessed Helen, mother of Constantine the Great,
looked for the Cross in Jerusalem and found it buried in the earth about the year 325.
Then the people, seeing it elevated on the ambo by the then patriarch of Jerusalem
Makarios, cried out, &quot;Lord, have mercy!&quot; Note that after its finding part of the
precious Cross was taken to Constantinople as a blessing, while the rest was left in
Jerusalem. There it remained until the year 614, when the Persians, ravaging Palestine,
took it back to their own country (January 22nd). But later, in the year 628, Herakleios
led an army against them, took the precious Cross back again and brought it to
Constantinople.</font></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">21. Of the holy Apostle Quadratus of Magnesia, and of

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Quadratus was a disciple of the Apostles and became
Bishop of Athens. He was martyred under Hadrian in 117, though according to others
somewhat later under Aurelius.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Jonas was son of Amathi, from the city of
Gethchopher, or Geth-Opher (4 Kingd.14:25), of the tribe of Zabulon. He prophesied around
838-810 BC. God ordered him to leave for Nineve, the capital of the Assyrians and to
preach its imminent overthrow, because of the sins of its citizens. But Jonas disobeyed
the divine command and taking ship departed elsewhere. The sudden and dreadful tumult of
the sea and the revelation of Jonas&#146; disobedience compelled the sailors to throw him
overboard. A great whale, at once made ready by divine foreknowledge, swallowed him down.
He spent three days and nights in its belly, where he prayed, saying the sixth ode of the
canon: <i>I cried to the Lord my God in my distress</i>, etc. Afterwards the whale vomited
him up onto dry land, and once again God&#146;s former command came to him. And so he
departed and preached, saying, &#145;Yet three days and Ninive will be destroyed&#146;. At
this the people were terrified; all repented; they fasted, great, small, babes at the
breast and even the animals; and in this way they appeased God and escaped his wrath. The
prophecy of Jonas is divided into four chapters, and is ranked fifth among the Twelve
Minor Prophets. His three day sojourn in the belly of the whale is an image of the three
day burial and life-bringing resurrection of the Saviour (Matt.12:39-40).</font></p>

Angel Gabriel appeared and said to Zachary, &#145;You supplication has been heard and your
wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call his name John&#146;. But Zachary,
aware of his Elizabeth&#146;s barrenness and that they were both well advanced in years,
did not believe the Angel&#146;s words; and so he was condemned by him to remain silent
and dumb until the words were fulfilled in their time. And so it came to pass (Lk.1:7-24.

beloved disciple and bosom friend of Christ. Alone of the other disciples he followed him
to the Cross, when he was also entrusted with the Virgin, as another son to her and true
brother of the teacher Jesus. After this he preached him to all Asia, and especially to
Ephesus. When the second persecution of the Christians was launched by Domitian, he was
taken bound from Asia to Rome, and there he was cast into a cauldron of boiling oil.
Removed from it unharmed he was exiled to Patmos, where he wrote the Apocalypse. Returning
to Ephesus after the tyrant&#146;s death, he, last of the other evangelists, wrote the
Gospel in his name and his three General Epistles; and when he had lived altogether about
95 years he fell asleep in peace under Trajan in the year 100. He was surnamed the
Theologian because he &quot;theologised&quot; [i.e. contemplated] the ineffable eternal
generation of the Son and Word of God the Father; for this reason there is depicted in his
icon the form of an eagle, one of the four symbolic living creatures which the Prophet
Ezekiel saw (1:10).</font></p>
