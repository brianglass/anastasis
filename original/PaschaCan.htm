<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The day of Resurrection, let us be radiant, O peoples! Pascha, the Lord&#146;s Pascha;
for Christ God has brought us from death to life, and from earth to heaven, as we sing the
triumphal song. </font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Let us purify our senses, and in the unapproachable light of the resurrection we shall
see Christ shining forth, and we shall clearly hear him saying &#145;Rejoice!&#146;, as we
sing the triumphal song.</p>

<p>Let the heavens, as is fitting, rejoice and let the earth be glad. Let the whole world,
both seen and unseen, keep the feast: for Christ has risen, our eternal joy.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 3. Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Come let us drink a new drink, not one marvellously brought forth from a barren rock,
but a Source of incorruption, which pours out from the tomb of Christ, in whom we are
established.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Now all things have been filled with light, both heaven and earth and those beneath the
earth; so let all creation sing Christ&#146;s rising, by which it is established.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was buried with you O Christ, today I rise with you as you arise. Yesterday
I was crucified with you; glorify me with you, Saviour, in your Kingdom.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 4. Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Let the Prophet Avvakoum, inspired by God, keep the divine watch with us, and show
forth the radiant Angel, who with resounding voice declares, &#145;To-day is salvation for
the world, for Christ has risen as omnipotent&#146;.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Christ appeared as a &#145;male&#146; who opened the virgin womb. As our food he is
called &#145;lamb&#146;; &#145;unblemished&#146;, as our Passover without stain; and
&#145;perfect&#146;, for he is true God.</p>

<p>As a yearling lamb, for us the blessed crown, Christ was willingly sacrificed for all,
a cleansing Passover. And from the tomb the fair Sun of justice has shone for us again.</p>

<p>God&#146;s forebear David, dancing, leaped before the Ark, mere shadow, but seeing the
fulfilment of the types, let us, God&#146;s holy people, inspired, rejoice, for Christ has
risen as omnipotent.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Those who were held by Hades&#146; bonds, seeing your measureless compassion, press
forward to the light, O Christ, with joyful steps, praising an eternal Passover.</p>

<p>With torches in our hands let us go out to meet Christ as he comes from the grave like
a bridegroom, and with the festive ranks of Angels, let us together feast God&#146;s
saving Passover.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 6. Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You went down to the deepest parts of the earth, and you shattered the everlasting bars
of those that those that were fettered, O Christ. And on the third day, like Jonas from
the whale, you arose from the tomb.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Keeping the seals intact, O Christ, you rose from the tomb, you who did not harm the
locks of the Virgin&#146;s womb at your birth, and you have opened to us the gates of
Paradise.</p>

<p>O my Saviour, the living, unslain Victim, as God offering yourself willingly to the
Father, you raised with yourself all Adam&#146;s race, in rising from the tomb.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 7. Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>He who delivered the Young Men from the furnace, becoming man suffers as a mortal, and
through suffering he clothes the mortal with the glory of incorruption: the only blessed
and most glorious God of our fathers.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The holy women hastened after you with sweet spices. The One whom they sought with
tears as a mortal, they worshipped with joy as the living God, and they proclaimed the
mystic Passover, O Christ, to your disciples.</p>

<p>We feast death&#146;s slaughter, the overthrow of Hell, the first fruits of a new
eternal life: and dancing we hymn the cause: the only blessed and most glorious God of our
fathers.</p>

<p>How truly holy and all-festive is this saving night, how full of light, herald of the
bright day of the resurrection, in which the timeless Light shone bodily for all from the
tomb.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 8. Irmos.</font></p>

<p>Come let us share in the new fruit of the vine, in divine joy, and in the kingdom of
Christ, on the glorious day of the Resurrection, as we sing his praise as God to all the
ages.</p>

<p>Lift your eyes around you, Sion, and see. For behold, like beacons shedding light
divine your children have come to you, from West and North, from the Sea and from the
East, blessing Christ in you to all the ages.</p>

<p>Almighty Father, Word and Spirit, nature united in three Persons, beyond all being and
beyond all Godhead, into you we have been baptised and we bless you to all the ages.</font></p>
