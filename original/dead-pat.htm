<p align="center"><font face="Bangkok" size="5" color="#800080">INTRODUCTION</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#800000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">This is first of two
sermons on this subject, the second of which is considerably longer and appears to have
been delivered on a Sunday. Both are written in heptasyllabic verse, called in Syriac the
&#145;Metre of Mar Ephrem&#146;. The latter is followed by two short sermons, which are
described in their titles as being in verse. The first of these, which the Greek editor
Phrantzolas, not having realised that the first two sermons are also in verse, describes
as a metrical extension of the second sermon <em>On The Fathers Who Have Completed Their
Course</em>, is tetrasyllabic, the second heptasyllabic. It is not possible to divide the
poem into regular stanzas, and it is not unlikely that the text is corrupt, but there is
as yet no critical edition. The paragraph divisions in the following translation are
simply to assist the reader. Each line of the translation represents two seven syllable
lines of the original, divided by a caesura in the middle. In one or places I have started
a new sense paragraph at the caesura. Translated from the Greek text edited by K.
Phrantzolas [Thessaloniki 1989. Volume 2 pp. 9-16]</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Book Antiqua" size="5">SERMON<br>
ON THE FATHERS<br>
WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR COURSE</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">My heart is in pain. Have compassion for me,
brethren.<br>
Blessed servants, come, listen to me. <br>
My soul is grieved, my nerves are in pain.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Where are tears, where compunction,<br>
that I may wash my body with tears and groans?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Who will remove me to an uninhabited place,<br>
where there is no hubbub which cuts off tears,<br>
no confusion which prevents weeping?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">I raised my voice and wept to God<br>
with bitter tears, and I said with groans,</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">&#145;Heal me, Lord, that I may be healed,<br>
because my heart is in grievous pain<br>
and its groans do not allow me to take<br>
a moment&#146;s rest. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">For I see, Master,<br>
that like choice gold you take your saints<br>
from this vain world to the repose of life.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Like a wise farmer with understanding,<br>
when he sees the fruits have ripened well,<br>
harvests them at once, that they may not be spoiled<br>
by any harmful damage, so you, O Saviour,<br>
gather in your elect who have toiled in holiness.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">But we the idle, slack by choice,<br>
have remained so in our hardness,<br>
and our fruit has always remained unripe,</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">for we have not had any firm intent to ripen well<br>
by good works and to be harvested in holiness<br>
into the granary of life. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Our fruit<br>
has no tears to ripen it,<br>
no compunction to make it blossom<br>
from the breeze of tears, no humility<br>
to shade it from above<br>
against the burning heat, no non-possessiveness,<br>
so that it is not weighed down by enemies,</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">no love of God, the mighty root<br>
which bears fruit, no non-anxiety<br>
for earthly things, no vigil,<br>
no watchful mind, alert in prayer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Instead of all these fair and excellent virtues,<br>
it has the opposite: fierce anger and rage<br>
which buffets the fruit and makes it useless;<br>
love of possessions which weighs it down heavily;<br>
great despondency. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">All these defects,<br>
how can they allow the fruit to ripen in holiness,<br>
so that it is of use to its own Master,<br>
the heavenly husbandman? Alas, alas, my soul,<br>
cry out and weep, so speedily deprived<br>
of perfect fathers and venerable ascetics.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Where are the fathers? Where are the saints?<br>
Where are the watchers? Where the alert?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Where the humble? And where are the meek?<br>
Where the still? Where the self-controlled?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Where the devout? Where the non-possessors?<br>
Where the repentant, well-pleasing to God?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">It was they who stood in pure prayer<br>
in the presence of God, like angels of God,<br>
almost watering the earth with the sweet tears<br>
and compunction. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Where are God&#146;s friends,<br>
filled with the love of God? Possessing nothing<br>
corruptible on earth, but constantly taking<br>
up their cross they followed the Saviour,</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">walking safely by the narrow road,<br>
taking absolute care not to fall into ravines<br>
in an untrodden desert, waterless and dark,</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">but on the even road of the truth<br>
of God&#146;s commands, ever full of the light<br>
of Christ&#146;s orders, journeying in a fair<br>
way of life and fervently serving God,<br>
willingly afflicted in this vain life.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">And therefore God loved them dearly<br>
and gathered them into the haven of life<br>
and into eternal joy, that they might be glad there,<br>
and in the Paradise of pleasure and the heavenly bridal chamber<br>
they might take their delight in the immortal Bridegroom<br>
with the greatest joy. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">They have gone from here<br>
to God, the holy, with them they have<br>
their lamps all prepared. Their virtue<br>
is not found among us now. Their ascetic practice<br>
is not found among us now. Their self-mastery<br>
is not found among us now. Their piety<br>
is not found among us now. Their meekness<br>
is not found among us now. Their non-possessiveness<br>
is not found among us now. Their keeping vigil<br>
is not found among us now. Nor is love for God<br>
found among us now. Christ&#146;s compassion<br>
is not found among us now. Nor is sympathy for his members<br>
found among us. But we are all<br>
savage, untamed and quite unable<br>
to endure one another. Hour by hour our tongues<br>
are fiery darts directed against one another.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">We all seek honour, we all love glory,<br>
we all love possessions, we are all slackers,</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">we are all slumberers. We are all crooked,<br>
full of energy for gossip, sluggish for prayer,</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">resolute for roving, feeble at stillness,<br>
all too eager for pleasure, sullen at self-mastery,</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">cold at loving and hot at hating,<br>
sluggish at good deeds, eager for wicked.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Who would not lament and who would not weep<br>
at our disposition, so full of slackness?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Those fathers, who before us became<br>
pleasing to the Lord and saved themselves,<br>
were not slack like this. The perfect did not have<br>
two thoughts, but only one:<br>
how they might be saved. They were a pure mirror<br>
for all who saw them. One of them was able<br>
to intercede with God for many people.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Again two of them had strength to stand<br>
in the presence of God with holy prayers,<br>
to implore with holiness the God who loves mankind<br>
on behalf of thousands. Alas, alas, my soul,<br>
in what sort of time are we? Alas, my beloved brothers,<br>
what dregs of wickedness have we now reached?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Wilfully we do not know. Because the eye of the soul<br>
is not alert through great blindness<br>
and vain distractions, for this reason we are<br>
unable to perceive the tribulation upon us.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">See, the holy and just are even now being chosen<br>
and gathered into the harbour of life,</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">that they may not see the tribulation and scandals<br>
which are coming upon us through our sins.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">They are being chosen, and we are nodding off.<br>
They are being snatched away, and we are being dragged off<br>
towards the vain world. They are being assembled,<br>
and we are asleep. They are going<br>
with boldness towards God,<br>
and we are distracted upon earth. The Lord&#146;s coming<br>
is at the doors, and we doubt.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The heavenly trumpet is ready to sound<br>
at God&#146;s command, and the universe to shake<br>
at its dread call, that it may rouse the dead<br>
and that each may be rewarded in accordance with their deeds.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The powers of heaven stand ready<br>
in their ranks to advance with fear<br>
before the Bridegroom as he comes in glory<br>
on the clouds of heaven to judge the living and the dead;<br>
and we do not believe. What then will come<br>
upon us in that hour, brethren?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">How may we there defend ourselves to God<br>
for our negligence of our salvation?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">If we do not now hasten and weep unrestrainedly,<br>
repenting fully in humility of soul<br>
and great meekness, how each one of us is going<br>
to lament at the tribulation! Changing our ways,<br>
let each one of us say with bitter tears,<br>
&#145;Woe is me, a sinner! What has happened of a sudden?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">How has my life of slackness passed away?<br>
Thoughtless, I do not know how my time has<br>
been stolen from me. Where are those days<br>
of stillness, which I spent<br>
in distractions, that I may repent<br>
in sackcloth and ashes? And nothing has been gained<br>
from many words.&#146; </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">When we see the saints<br>
again in glory, flying in light<br>
on the clouds of the air to meet Christ,<br>
the King of Glory, but see ourselves<br>
in the great tribulation, who will be able to bear<br>
that shame and that dread reproach?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Let us be alert, my brethren, let us be alert,
beloved,<br>
let us be alert, friends of God, beloved children<br>
of God the Father, let us come to ourselves,</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">and let gather our thoughts a little<br>
from this empty life. Let us fall down before God<br>
with many tears, let us beseech him<br>
with zeal unrestrainedly, that he may deliver us<br>
from the unquenchable fire and bitter punishment.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">May we not be separated from him, the sweet Master,<br>
who loved us and gave himself<br>
for us on the Cross. I, unworthy<br>
and a sinner, beg you all<br>
and implore you all, in your prayer<br>
and pure supplication, pour out tears<br>
also for me, the slacker, that I may feel compunction<br>
and weep with you; that my blind heart<br>
may be a little enlightened<br>
and that I may seek God, the holy Saviour,<br>
so that he grant me perfect zeal<br>
to repent with speed, until there is time<br>
for my tears to be accepted, and with you, my brethren,<br>
I too, though unworthy of life, shall be saved.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">I beg you, beloved, accept the entreaty<br>
of the sinner Ephrem, your slack brother.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">And let us all earnestly endeavour to make the holy
God<br>
merciful while we have time.<br>
For see, the Lord is standing at the door<br>
to bring to an end this vain age.</font></p>
