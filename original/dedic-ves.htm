<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>It is an ancient law that dedication is to be honoured, and it is good; but rather
should what is new be honoured through dedication, for, as Isaias says, islands are
dedicated to God, which are to be understood as the Churches from the nations, which have
lately been established and received stability for God. Therefore let us too celebrate
spiritually the festival of the present Dedication.</font></p>

<p>Be dedicated anew brethren! And putting off the old man, live in newness of life,
placing a bridle on all those things from which death comes. Let us discipline all our
members, hating every evil eating of the tree, and for this reason only remembering the
old that we may flee it. Thus is humankind renewed, thus the day of the Dedication is
honoured.</font></p>

sing your praise, as we say, &#145;You are the one who is our King before the ages and for
ever and ever. Glory to you!&#146;</font></p>

we glorify you, who sanctified and perfected it by your perfect grace. You delight in the

those who rightly offer them cleansing of sins and your great mercy.</font></p>

<p>Solomon stood before the Altar of the Lord, in front of the whole Assembly of Israel,
and spread out his hands to heaven and said, &#145;Lord God of Israel, there is no god
like you in heaven above or on earth below. If heaven and the highest heaven will not be
adequate for you, how much less then this House which I have built in your name? And you,
Lord God of Israel, will look upon my supplication, to hear the supplication and the
prayer which your servant makes before you this day, that your eyes may be open towards
this house day and night, towards this place of which you have said, &#145;My name will be
there&#146;, to hearken to the prayer which your servant makes at this place day and
night. And you will hearken to the supplication of your servant and of your people Israel,
whatever they may pray for at this place, and you will hearken in the place of your
habitation in heaven, and you will act be merciful to them.&#146;</p>

<p>It shall be from the eighth day and upwards, the Priests shall make your holocausts
upon the altar, and those for your salvation; and I shall accept you, says the Lord. And
he turned me back by the way of the outer gate of the Holy Place, which looks towards the
east, and it was shut. And the Lord said to me, &#145;This gate shall be shut, it shall
not be opened, and no one shall pass through it, because the Lord, the God of Israel, will
enter through it, and it shall be shut. Therefore this prince shall sit in it to eat
bread. By the way of the Elam of the gate he shall enter, and by that way he shall go
out&#146;. And he brought me by the way of the gate towards the North, opposite the House;
and I saw, and behold the whole house of the Lord was full of glory.</p>

<p>With wisdom God founded the earth. He prepared the heavens with understanding. With his
knowledge the deeps were broken open and the clouds poured down dew. My son, keep my
counsel and my thought, do not pour them away, that your soul may live and grace be around
your neck; and there shall be health for your flesh and safety for your bones; that with
confidence you may walk all your ways in peace, and your foot may not stumble. For if you
sit down, you shall be unafraid; if you slumber, you shall have sweet sleep; you shall not
fear alarm coming upon you, nor the assaults of the impious; for the Lord shall be over
all your ways and shall support your feet, so that you are not snared. Do not hold back
from doing good to the needy, whenever your hand is able to help. Do not say, &#145;Come
back again sometime&#146;, and, &#145;Tomorrow I shall give&#146;. When you are able, do
good, for you do not know what the coming day will bring forth. Do not devise evils for
your friend who lives near you and trusts you. Do not quarrel with someone needlessly,
lest they devise some evil against you. Do not gain the reproaches of wicked men, nor
covet their ways; for every transgressor is unclean before the Lord, he does not take his
seat among the just. The Lord&#146;s curse is on the houses of the ungodly, but the
dwellings of the just are blessed. The Lord opposes the proud, but gives grace to the
humble.</font></p>
