Lord, hear my prayer; in your truth give ear to my supplication, and in your righteousness
hear me. Do not enter into judgement with your servant, for in your sight no one living
can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul; humbled my life to the ground; made me
dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit in me grew weary, and my heart was
troubled within me. I remembered days of old; I meditated on all your works. I made the
works of your hands my meditation. I stretched out my hands towards you; my soul thirsted
for you like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord; my spirit has failed. Do not turn
your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear of your
mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I should
walk, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord; I have run to
you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit will guide
me in an upright land. For your name&#146;s sake, O Lord, you will give me life. In your
righteousness you will bring my soul out of trouble; in your mercy slay my enemies, and

thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my
wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you only I have sinned and done what is
evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words and win when you are judged.
For see, in wickedness I was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have
loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will
sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will wash me and I shall be made
whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been
humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out
from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your
salvation, and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your
ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from
bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips, and my
mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it.
You will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit. A
broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good
pleasure, and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a
sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer
calves upon your altar.</font></p>

down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him, beat
him, and went away, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that
road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he
came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan while
travelling came near him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity. He went to him and
bandaged his wounds, having poured oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own
animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. The next day he took out two denarii,
gave them to the innkeeper, and said, `Take care of him; and when I come back, I will
repay you whatever more you spend&#146;. Which of these three, do you think, was a

have given us new birth from sin, you give light to the blind, set upright those are cast
down; you love the righteous and are merciful to sinners; you have called us back from
darkness and the shadow of death, saying to those in chains: Come forth, and to those in
darkness reveal yourselves. For in our hearts has shone the light of the knowledge of your
Only-begotten Son, since for us he appeared on earth and lived among men. And to as many
as received him he gave power to become your children, O God, granting us the grace of
sonship through the washing of rebirth, and causing us to have no part in the domination
of the devil. Since he did not consider it good for there to be cleansing by blood but by
holy Oil, he has given us the sign of his Cross for us to become Christ&#146;s flock, a
royal priesthood, a holy nation, having purified us by water and hallowed us by the holy
Spirit. Do you, Master and Lord, give grace for this your service, as you gave Moses your
servant, Samuel your beloved, John your chosen one and all those who in each generation
have been well-pleasing to you. So make us too servants of the new Testament of your Son
for this oil, which you have made your own by your precious Blood, that having put off
worldly desires we may die to sin and live to righteousness, having put on our Lord Jesus
Christ through the anointing of sanctification of the Oil which is about to be applied.
May this oil, Lord, be an oil of gladness, an oil of sanctification, a royal garment, a
breastplate of power, a protection against every operation of the devil, an inviolable
seal, joy of heart, eternal delight, that all who are anointed with this oil of rebirth
may become fearsome to their enemies and shine brightly with the brightness of your
Saints, without spot or wrinkle, and that they may be received into your eternal rest and
receive the prize of their high calling. </p>

from their youth, who do not want the death of sinners, but that turn back and live, who,
being God, for the salvation of sinners became man, for the sake of your creature being
made a creature. It is you who said: I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to
repentance; you who sought the lost sheep; you who diligently sought the lost coin, and
found it; you who said: The one who comes to me I will in no way cast out; you who did not
abhor the Harlot when she drenched your honoured feet with her tears; you who said: As
often as you fall, arise and you will be saved; you who said: There is joy in heaven over
one sinner who repents. Look then, compassionate Master, from your holy height,
overshadowing us sinners and your unworthy servants with the grace of the holy Spirit at

approach you in faith. And receiving them by your own love for mankind, and pardoning them

your all-holy name may be glorified in them.</p>

forms of leadership, various kinds of tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all
teachers? Do all work miracles? Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with
tongues? Do all interpret? But earnestly desire the higher gifts. And I will show you a
still more excellent way. If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not
love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and
understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove
mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all my possessions, and if I
hand over my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient and
kind; love is not jealous, love is not boastful or arrogant or rude. Love does not insist
on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but
rejoices in the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures

lying in bed with a fever; he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and
began to serve him. That evening they brought to him many who were possessed with demons;
and he cast out the spirits with a word, and cured all who were sick. This was to fulfil
what had been spoken through the prophet Isaias &#145;He took our infirmities and bore our
diseases&#146;. Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave orders to go over to
the other side. A scribe then approached and said, &#145;Teacher, I will follow you
wherever you go&#146;. And Jesus said to him, &#145;Foxes have holes, and birds of the air
have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head&#146;. Another of his disciples
said to him, &#145;Lord, first let me go and bury my father&#146;. But Jesus said to him,

without pain and take our diseases, who are merciful with gentleness, who pass over

breathed on your own Disciples and said: Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins
of any, they are forgiven them; who accept the repentance of sinners and have authority to
pardon many and grievous sins, and who grant healing to all live long in infirmity and
protracted sickness; who have also called me, your humble, sinful and unworthy servant,
who am entangled in many sins and wallow in the passions of pleasures, to the holy and
most lofty degree of the Priesthood, and to enter within the veil, into the Holy of
Holies, where Angels desire to stoop, and to hear the gospel voice of the Lord God and to
see with my own eyes the presence of the holy Oblation, and to delight in the divine and
sacred Liturgy; who have counted me worthy to celebrate your holy Mysteries and to offer
you gifts and sacrifices for our sins and for those committed in ignorance by your people,
and to mediate on behalf of your rational sheep, so that through your great and ineffable
love for mankind you would wipe away their offences. Do you, O King supremely good, give
ear to my prayer at this hour and on this holy day, and at every hour and in every place,
and attend to the voice of my supplication; and give healing to your servants who are in
infirmity of soul and body, granting them forgiveness of sins and pardon of offences both
voluntary and involuntary, healing their incurable wounds and every disease and every
sickness. Give them healing of soul, you who touched Peter&#146;s mother in law and the
fever left her and she arose and began to serve you. Do you yourself, Master, grant
healing and alleviation of every pain, and remember your rich acts of pity and your mercy.
Remember that the thought of man is constantly bent on wicked deeds from his youth and
that none is found sinless on earth, for you alone are without sin, who came and save the
human race and freed us from the slavery of the enemy; for if you enter into judgement
with your servants, no one will be found pure of stain; but every mouth will be shut,
having nothing with which to make defence, because all our righteousness is like a
tattered rag before you. Therefore do not remember the sin of our youth, Lord. For you are
the hope of the hopeless and the rest of those who toil and are heavy laden with
iniquities, and to you we give glory, together with your Father who is without beginning
and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and forever, and to the ages of ages.</p>

sheep that had gone astray, who give comfort to the faint-hearted and life to the crushed,
who healed the flow of the woman with an issue of blood for twelve years, who healed the

and gave forgiveness to the sinful woman, who granted healing to the paralysed man with
the forgiveness of his sins, who justified the Publican by a word and accepted the Thief

We beg and implore you: In your loving-kindness loose, forgive, pardon, O God, the
iniquities and sins of your servants, their offences both voluntary and involuntary, in
knowledge and in ignorance, by transgression and disobedience, by night and by day; or if
they are the curse of a Priest or of father or mother; if they have feasted their eyes,
indulged their sense of smell, been seduced by touch or fornicated by taste, or by
whatever movement of flesh and spirit have become estranged from your will and from your
holiness. Pardon whatever sins they or we have committed, for you, O God, are good, you do
not remember evil and you love mankind, and do not let them or us fall into a defiled life
or run into ways of destruction. Yes, Master and Lord, hearken to me a sinner at this hour
on behalf of your servants. Overlook, O God, as you do not remember evil, all their
offences, free them from eternal punishment, fill their mouths with your praise, open
their lips to glorify your name, stretch out their hands to the doing of your
commandments, direct their feet to the course of your Gospel, making all their members and
their thoughts safe by your grace. For you are our God, who commanded us by your holy
Apostles, saying: Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you
loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. And again: If you forgive the sins of any they
are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any they are retained. And as you hearkened
to Ezechias in the affliction of his soul at the hour of his death and did not disregard
his petition, even so hearken to me also, your humble, sinful and unworthy servant at this
hour as I entreat you. For you, Lord Jesus Christ, are the one who commanded in your
goodness and love for mankind to forgive those who fall seventy times seven, and you
repent over our evils deeds and rejoice at the turning back of those who have gone astray.</p>

bodies, who cure chronic sufferings and heal every disease and sickness among the people,
who wish that all should be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth, who do not desire
the death of sinners, but rather that they be converted and live. For it was you, Lord,
who in the old Testament established repentance for the sinners, David and the Ninevites,
and for those before and for those after them. But also during the course of your
incarnate dispensation you did not call the righteous, but sinners to repentance, like the
Publican, the Harlot, the Thief and the blasphemer and great persecutor Paul, whom you
received through repentance. Peter, the leader and your Apostle, who had denied you three
times, you received through repentance and accepted and made him this promise: You are
Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail
against it. And I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of heaven. And therefore, good
Master, who love mankind, we too confident in accordance with your faithful promises, beg
and implore you at this hour: Hearken to our supplication and accept it like incense
offered to you, and visit your servants. And if they have offended in word or deed or by
thought, by night or by day, or if they have come under the curse of a Priest, or fallen
under their own anathema, or been embittered by a curse and have forsworn themselves, we
beg and beseech you: Loose, forgive, pardon them, O God, overlooking their iniquities,
their sins and what ever has been committed by them in knowledge and in ignorance. And if
they have in anything transgressed your commandments, because they bear flesh and dwell in
the world or through the activity of the Devil, as you, O God, are good and love mankind,
pardon them. Because there is none who will live and not sin, for you alone are without
sin, your righteousness is righteousness for ever and your word is truth. Because you did
not fashion humanity for destruction, but for the keeping of your commandments and
inheritance of incorruptible life.</p>

against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every disease and every sickness.
And so, as you lived well by his commandments, freely you received, freely give, healing
the passions and sufferings of our souls and bodies.</p>

you, Sovereign Lady, not be put to shame. Hasten to the entreaty of those who cry out to
you with faith: Hail, Sovereign Lady, the help, joy and protection of all and the
salvation of our souls.</font></p>
