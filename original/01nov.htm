<p>Placing all their hope in heaven, the Saints treasured up for themselves an inviolable
treasure; freely they received, freely they give remedies to the sick; in accordance with
the Gospel they possessed neither gold nor silver; their kind deeds they shared out to
humans and beasts alike; that being in all things obedient to Christ they might intercede
with confidence on behalf of our souls.</p>

<p>They spurned all perishable matter on earth, while like Angels in the flesh they were
declared citizens of heaven, the united comradeship, the like-minded and harmonious pair
of saints. And so to all who suffer they award healings, granting their kindness without
payment for the needy. Let us worthily sing their praise with yearly feasts as they
intercede with confidence on behalf of our souls.</p>

<p>Bringing all the Trinity to dwell in them, the holy pair, inspired Cosmas and Damian,
like fountains pour out waters of healings from a life-bearing source; whose relics too
heal passions through a touch; and their names alone drive sicknesses from mortals; they
are saviours for all who flee to them as they intercede to Christ with boldness on behalf
of our souls.</p>

<p>The choir of the Saints rejoices to the ages; for they have inherited the kingdom of
heaven. Earth has received their relics and is filled with sweet fragrance. Christ&#146;s
servants have taken up their dwelling for eternal life.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The same Tone.</p>

<p>Physicians of the sick, treasuries of remedies, saviours of believers, far-famed
Unmercenaries, heal those who cry out in need and who suffer pain, as with Theodoti you
intercede with the good God that we may be rescued from all the snares of the foe.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#ff0000" size="4">Tone 4.
By Theophanes.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>Holy Unmercenaries, you possess a source of remedies and grant healings to all who ask,
for you have been found worthy of the greatest gifts from the unfailing source of the
Saviour Christ. For to you, as rivals of the Apostles in zeal, the Lord says: See, I have
given you authority against unclean spirits, so as to cast them out and so as to cure
every disease and every weakness. And so, having lived your lives well in accordance with
his commands, freely you have received, freely you give, as you heal the sufferings of our
souls and bodies.</p>

<p>Hail refuge of Christians and their might; hail heavenly Ladder; hail treasure-chest of
virginity; hail Mother of God, the spiritual Ark of the divine; hail boast and support of
the world, recalling of the fallen, the Tabernacle, wholly light, holy and all good.</font></p>

<p>When the All-pure saw Christ the lover of mankind crucified and pierced in the side,
she wept and cried out; What is this, my Son ? Is this how an ungrateful people repays you
for the good things you have done for them? Why, so much beloved, do you hasten to leave
me childless? I am filled with amazement, O Compassionate, at your voluntary crucifixion.</font></p>

<p>Who would not wonder? Who would not glorify? Who would not faithfully praise the
wonders of the wise and glorious Unmercenaries? Because also after their holy passing
over, they give remedies richly to all who have recourse to them; and their precious and
holy relics pour forth the grace of healings. O holy Pair! O honoured Saints! O wisdom and
glory of the grace given us by God! And so let us sing to God our Benefactor, who has
revealed them for the healing of our souls and bodies.</p>

<p>I cannot bear to see you, my Child, who give awakening to all, sleeping on the Tree,
that you may grant to those, who of old fell into a deadly sleep from the fruit of
transgression, you may grant divine and saving awakening, the grieving Virgin, whom we
magnify.</font>
