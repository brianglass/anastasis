<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="6">INTRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">This translation into English of the services for
the Dedication of a Church was made at the request of His Eminence Archbishop Gregorios of
Thyateira and Great Britain. It is based on the fourth edition of the booklet issued by
the <i>Apostoliki Diakonia</i> in Athens in 1992, though the older text in the <i>Large
Euchologion </i>has also been taken into account. Since the translation was intended for
practical use, it has been completed by the inclusion of many of those things that Greek
liturgical books tend to take for granted, but which singers and readers often overlook.
The role of the people has usually been indicated by using the word &#145;People&#146;,
rather than &#145;Singers&#146;, or &#145;Choir&#146;, who represent them.</p>

<p>The rite in the <i>Large Euchologion </i>and the modern booklet includes the texts for
Vespers and Matins as well as a number of other rites, such as those for consecrating
Antimensia, chalices and patens, that for the washing of the Altar on Holy Thursday and
the various rites for reconsecrating desecrated Churches. These last are not included
here.</p>

<p>The present Greek rite for the Consecration of a Church seems to have undergone a
radical revision at some time between the publication at Venice in 1638 of the <i>Euchologion</i>
used by Goar for his edition and that published at Venice in 1862, which forms the basis
of the current edition of the <i>Large Euchologion</i>, such as that published by <i>Astir</i>
at Athens in 1970. The text of the rite in the Venetian edition of 1862 is in fact that of
the edition published in Bucharest in 1703. In the earlier rite, which is still that found
in the Slavonic books, the procession and solemn entry of the relics form the climax of
the ceremony, which begins with the consecration and vesting of the altar. That this is
the correct order is evident from the incoherent ending of the present Greek rite, in
which, immediately after the final two prayers, the Deacon appears to announce a
procession from the Church, &#145;Let us go forth in peace&#146;. No procession follows,
but at once we have a Prokeimenon, Apostle and Gospel, the latter without an
&#145;Alleluia&#146;. After this the Bishop fills and lights the first lamp in the new
Church. Two stichera, the Trisagion prayers and the Apolytikia of the Saint and the
Dedication are followed by the a litany and the Dismissal. The Apostle and Gospel are
really those for the following Liturgy and are not part of the rite of Dedication. There
is also some confusion over the final Litany. The text of the 1992 book gives the
shortened form of the Litany of Fervent Supplication found in a number of rites, such as
those for Baptism and Marriage, whereas the <i>Diataxis </i>given earlier in the book
prescribes the closing Litany of Matins, &#145;Let us complete our morning prayer to the
Lord&#146;. The relics, which have been solemnly brought to the Church earlier, were
accompanied by lights and therefore, unless the latter were left outside the building,
there seems little point in the solemn lighting of the first lamp in the new Church at the
very end of the service, after which, the rubric informs us, &#145;The people are
permitted to light lamps and candles&#146;.</p>

<p>The older form of the rite is that presupposed in the description by St Nicolas
Cabasilas in his Book 5 of <i>On Life in Christ</i> and by his near contemporary, Saint
Symeon of Thessaloniki. The latter specifically excludes from the building for the first
part of the ceremony the laity [pg 145:309-312], who enter the newly consecrated building
for the first time in solemn procession with the Bishop carrying the relics of the
Martyrs.</p>

<p>The other notable difference is that the procession of the relics itself is much
simpler in the older rite, without any Apostles or Gospels and without the singing of the
third and sixth Odes of the Canon. In the Litany of Peace before the Consecration of the
Altar, the current rite includes the petition &#145;For this holy house&#133;&#146;. This
is not in the older rite, since the &#145;House&#146; has not yet been consecrated.</p>

<p>An interesting detail is that for the Liturgy on the day of the consecration, as well
as on the annual Dedication feast, St Symeon notes that the Cherubic Hymn is &#145;Let all
mortal flesh keep silent&#146; [PG 145:328D].</p>

<p>The Greek words meaning &#145;dedicate&#146; and &#145;dedication&#146; are not easy to
translate into English, since they also have the connotation of &#145;newness&#146;,
&#145;renewal&#146;. The opening Stichera for Vespers, for example, make frequent play on
the ideas of &#145;new&#146; and &#145;old&#146;. David, in Psalm 50, asks God to
&#145;renew a right Spirit within me&#146;, rather than &#145;dedicate a right
Spirit&#146;. For this reason I have sometimes expanded slightly and used expressions like
&#145;dedicate anew&#146;, but without great clumsiness it is not possible to express both
these ideas of &#145;dedication&#146; and renewal&#146; in every instance. It is
important, therefore, to bear in mind that the &#145;dedication&#146; of a &#145;new&#146;
Church calls for the inner &#145;renewal&#146;, the &#145;rededication&#146; of all those
who take part in it. </p>

<p>The booklet from the <i>Apostoliki Diakonia</i> divides the rite into six sections, to
which we have added subtitles to explain the symbolism of the rite. The rite is really the
consecration of the Altar, the Church being sanctified by the presence of the consecrated
Altar. Without this, says St Symeon, a Church building is simply an oratory, or house of
prayer. The anointing of other parts of the building is, in the Byzantine rite, almost an
afterthought and according to the strict Typikon is done by a Priest, or another Bishop if
one is present, following the consecrating Bishop as he goes round censing the whole
Church towards the end of the whole ceremony.</p>

<p>At the end of Matins we have added a note from the <i>Large Euchologion</i> which
supposes that the actual dedication takes place after Matins. The two long prayers by
Patriarch Kallistos, which are to be said during Lauds in the present rite, are printed
quite separately in the <i>Euchologion</i> before the Rite itself. In the Slav books the
first of these forms the concluding prayer of the whole rite, while the second is not used
at all.</p>
