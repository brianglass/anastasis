After the 1st reading from the Psalter,  Resurrection Kathismata. Mode 2 Plagal.<br>
<span class="normal">With  the tomb opened and Hades lamenting, Mary cried to the Apostles in hiding, &lsquo;Come  out, you workers of the vineyard, proclaim the word of the Resurrection, &ldquo;The  Lord has risen, granting the world his great mercy!&rdquo;&rsquo;</span><br>
Verse: <span class="black">Arise, O Lord my God, lift up your hand: forget not your poor for ever.</span><br>
<span class="normal">Mary  Magdalen stood by your tomb, Lord, and she wept and cried aloud, and taking you  for the gardener, she said, &lsquo;Where have you hidden eternal Life? Where have you  placed the One who rides on the Cherubim? Those who were guarding him have died  through fear. Either give me my Lord, or with me cry out, &ldquo;O you who were among  the dead and raised the dead, glory to you!&rdquo;&rsquo;</span><br>
<span class="black">Glory. Both now. </span>Theotokion.<br>
<span class="normal">Gideon  foretells your conceiving, and David reveals your child-bearing, O Mother of  God; for the Word descended like rain upon a fleece into your womb, and you,  the holy earth, without seed budded forth salvation, Christ God, O Virgin full  of grace.</span><br>
After the 2nd reading from the Psalter,  others.<br>
<span class="normal">Life  was laid in the tomb and a seal was laid on the stone; soldiers were guarding  Christ like a sleeping King; and having invisibly struck his foes the Lord  arose.</span><br>
Verse: <span class="black">I  will praise you, Lord, with my whole heart: I will tell of all your marvellous  works.</span><br>
<span class="normal">Jonas  foretells your tomb, and Symeon reveals your divine Rising, immortal Lord; for  you descended as a corpse into the tomb, and destroyed the gates of Hades; but  you arose without corruption as Master, for the salvation of the world, Christ  our God, and enlightened those in darkness.</span><br>
<span class="black">Glory.  Both now.</span> Theotokion.<br>
<span class="normal">Virgin  Mother of God, implore your Son, Christ our God, who was willingly nailed to a  Cross and who raised the dead, Christ our God, that our souls may be saved.</span><br>
Ypako&iuml;.<br>
<span class="normal">By  your voluntary and life-giving death, O Christ, you smashed the gates of Hades,  as God, and opened to us the Paradise of old; and by rising from the dead you  delivered our life from corruption.</span><br>
The Anavathmi - 1st Antiphon<br>
<span class="normal">To  heaven I raise my eyes, to you, O Word; have pity on me, that I may live for  you.<br>
Have  mercy on us who are filled with contempt, repairing your vessels to be useful,  O Word.</span><br>
<span class="black">Glory.  Both now.</span><br>
<span class="normal">In  the Holy Spirit is the cause of all salvation, if he see fit to breathe on one  of these, he swiftly raises him from things of earth, gives him wings, makes  him grow and ranges him on high.</span><br>
<span class="black"><span class="red">2nd Antiphon</span></span><br>
<span class="normal">If  the Lord had not been among us, none of us could have withstood in the contest  with the foe; for those who are victorious are exalted from here.<br>
Let  not my soul be taken like a sparrow by their teeth, O Word; alas! How shall I,  lover of sin, be delivered from the foe?</span><br>
<span class="black">Glory.  Both now.</span><br>
<span class="normal">In  the Holy Spirit is divinisation for all, good-will, understanding, peace and  blessing; for he is equal in action to the Father and the Word.</span><br>
3rd Antiphon<br>
<span class="normal">Those  who trust in the Lord are fearful to their foes and wondrous to all; for they  look on high.<br>
The  inheritance of the just, having you, O Saviour, as helper will not stretch out  their hands in iniquities.</span><br>
<span class="black">Glory.  Both now.</span><br>
<span class="normal">In  the Holy Spirit is might over all things; him the armies above worship with  everything that has breath below.</span><br>
Prokeimenon.<br>
<span class="black">O  Lord, raise up your power: * and come to save us.<br>
</span><span class="red">Verse: </span><span class="black">Shepherd of Israel, give ear:  you that lead Jacob like a flock.</span><br>
<span class="normal">Let  everything that has breath.</span> <span class="red">The dawn Gospel.</span></span> <span class="normal">We have seen the  Resurrection <span class="red">etc., as usual.</span></span><br>
Canon of the Resurrection.<br>
Ode 1. Mode 2 Plagal. The Irmos. <span class="black">&#922;&#8059;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;  &#952;&#945;&#955;&#8049;&#963;&#963;&#951;&#962;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">Crossing  the sea as on dry land Israel watched Pharao the pursuer drowning in the deep  and they cried out, &lsquo;Let us sing a song of victory&rsquo;.</span><br>
Troparia.<br>
<span class="normal">With  your palms that had been stretched out on the Cross, good Jesu, you filled the  universe with the Father&rsquo;s good pleasure. Therefore let us all sing you a song  of victory.</span><br>
<span class="normal">The  end, like a servant girl under orders, with fear approaches you, the Master of  life, who through it grant us the prize of unending life and the Resurrection.</span><br>
Theotokion.<br>
<span class="normal">Having  received your own Creator, as he himself willed, incarnate beyond nature from  your womb, pure Virgin, you were revealed as truly Sovereign Lady of all  creatures.</span><br>
Another Canon, of the Cross and  Resurrection. <span class="black">&#922;&#8059;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;  &#952;&#945;&#955;&#8049;&#963;&#963;&#951;&#962;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">The God at whom earth and heaven tremble willingly stands at Pilate&rsquo;s judgement seat on a  lawless charge, and is struck in the face by an unjust hand.</span><br>
<span class="normal">You  opened wide your divine hands, O Saviour, on your immaculate and life-bringing  Cross, and you gathered to knowledge of you, Master, the nations who worship  your glorious Crucifixion.</span><br>
Cross-Theotokion.<br>
<span class="normal">The  All-blameless stood by your Cross, O Saviour, weeping floods of tears, as she  watched the drops of blood from your side, O Christ, and glorified your immense  compassion.</span><br>
Canon of the Most Holy of God, of which  the acrostic is:<em><br>
</em><span class="black">Mother of God,  grant me unstinted grace.</span><br>
Irmos. <span class="black">&#8041;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#7968;&#960;&#949;&#8055;&#961;&#8179;  &#960;&#949;&#950;&#949;&#8059;&#963;&#945;&#962;. </span><br>
<span class="normal">When  Eve partook of the food of disobedience of the tree she introduced the curse;  but the Pure Virgin abolished it when she bore Christ, the first fruit of  blessing.<br>
&nbsp;You bore Christ, the Pearl of the divine  lightning. Scatter the fog of my passions and the disorder of my faults, Pure  Virgin, by the light of your radiance.<br>
With  spiritual eyes Jacob mystically foresaw the expectation of the nations, the God  who was incarnate from you, and who delivered us at your mediation.<br>
When  rulers had failed from the tribe of Juda, O All-pure, your Son and God came  forth from you as leader and now truly reigns over the ends of the earth.</span><br>
Ode 3. Irmos.  <span class="black">&#927;&#8016;&#954;  &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7941;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#8033;&#962;  &#963;&#8059;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">None  is holy as you, O Lord my God, who have exalted the horn of your faithful  people, O Good one, and established me on the rock of confession of you.</span><br>
Troparia<br>
<span class="normal">Creation,  when it saw God crucified in the flesh, grew weak through fear; but by the hand  of the One who was crucified for us was mightily made firm.<br>
Death, destroyed by death, lies a lifeless coward, for the strong one, unable to stand the  divine assault of life, falls dead; and Resurrection is given to all.</span><br>
Theotokion<br>
<span class="normal">The  wonder of your divine child-bearing, Pure Virgin, surpasses every order of  nature, for beyond nature you conceived God in your womb, and having given  birth you remain Ever-Virgin.</span><br>
Another, of Cross and Resurrection.<span class="black"> &#931;&#8050; &#964;&#8056;&#957;  &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#8017;&#948;&#8049;&#964;&#969;&#957;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">Having  spent three days in a tomb, by your life-giving Rising you raised those who had  earlier been condemned to death, and, freed from their sentence, they gladly  rejoiced, crying out, &lsquo;See, you have come, Lord, our redemption.&rsquo;<br>
Glory  to your Rising, our Saviour, for as all-powerful you have delivered us from  Hades, corruption and death, singing we say, &lsquo;None is holy, but you, Lord,  lover of humankind&rsquo;.</span><br>
Theotokion<br>
<span class="normal">When  you saw the one born from you pierced by lance, you were pierced through the  heart, All-holy and unblemished, in consternation you said, &lsquo;How has the  lawless people repaid you?&rsquo;</span><br>
Another, of the Mother of God. <span class="black">&#927;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;  &#7941;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#8033;&#962; &#963;&#8059;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">Taking  my changing and mortal flesh ineffably from your womb, God&lsquo;s all-pure Mother,  the Good One bound it to himself eternally and made it incorruptible.<br>
When  they saw God incarnate from you, O Virgin, the choirs of Angels, were smitten  with fear, and in never silent hymns they honour you as Mother of God.<br>
The  Prophet Daniel was amazed, seeing you, a spiritual mountain from which a stone  was hewn without hands, and smashed with might, Mother of God, the altars of  the demons.<br>
No  mortal word or tongue has strength to praise you fittingly, O Virgin, for from  you, without seed, Christ the giver of life was well-pleased to be incarnate.</span><br>
Ode 4. Irmos. <span class="black">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8057;&#962; &#956;&#959;&#965;  &#948;&#8059;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">Christ  is my power, my God and Lord, the holy Church cries out from a pure mind in  song befitting God, as it keeps festival in the Lord. </span><br>
Troparia<br>
<span class="normal">The  tree of life has truly flowered, O Christ, for the Cross was fixed and, watered  with blood and water from your most pure side, it blossomed with life for us.<br>
No  longer does the serpent lyingly suggests deification to me; for Christ, the divine  fashioner of human nature, has opened wide for me the unhindered path of life.</span><br>
Theotokion<br>
<span class="normal">How  truly ineffable and incomprehensible to those on earth and in heaven, Mother of  God, are mysteries of your divine child-bearing.</span><br>
Another, of Cross and Resurrection. <span class="black">&#932;&#8052;&#957; &#7952;&#957;  &#931;&#964;&#945;&#965;&#961;&#8183; &#963;&#959;&#965;  &#952;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#957; &#954;&#8051;&#957;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#957;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">We  honour your precious Cross, O Christ, the nails and the holy lance, with the  reed and the crown of thorns. Through them we have been delivered from the  corruption of Hades.<br>
A  tomb received you, seen willingly a corpse for us, but in no way could it hold  you fast, for as God you arose and saved our race.</span><br>
Theotokion<br>
<span class="normal">Ever-virgin  God&rsquo;s conceiver, who for mortals gave birth to Christ the Saviour, deliver from  dangers and punishments those who with divine faith take refuge in your  protection.</span><br>
Another, of the Mother of God.  <span class="black">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8057;&#962;  &#956;&#959;&#965; &#948;&#8059;&#957;&#945;&#956;&#953;&#962;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">All-pure,  we who have been saved through you, the All-unblemished, and who devoutly sing  your praise, cry out, &lsquo;Blessed are you, Ever-Virgin, who bore God!&rsquo;<br>
All-blessed  Virgin, you gave birth to the inaccessible light that, appearing through flesh,  shines for those in the darkness of life, and for those who sing your praise,  Ever-Virgin, you are a source of joy.<br>
Grace  has flowered, the law has ceased, through you, All-holy, for you gave birth,  pure Ever-Virgin, to the Lord, who grants us forgiveness.<br>
Tasting  of a plant declared me to be a corpse, but the tree of life which appeared from  you, All-pure, raised me up and established me as heir to the delight of  Paradise.</span><br>
Ode 5. Irmos. <span class="black">&#932;&#8183; &#952;&#949;&#8055;&#8179;  &#966;&#8051;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#953; &#963;&#959;&#965;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">With  your divine radiance, O Good One, illumine, I beg, the souls of those who rise  to you at dawn with love to know you, Word of God, to be truly God, calling  them back from the gloom of offences. </span><br>
Troparia<br>
<span class="normal">The  Cherubim withdraw for me, and now the sword of flame takes flight, Master, Word  of God, on seeing you, the true God, making Paradise a road for a Thief. <br>
I no  longer fear your return to earth, Christ my Master, for through your great  compassion you raised me, who was forgotten, to the height of incorruption by  your Resurrection</span>.<br>
Theotokion<br>
<span class="normal">Good  sovereign Lady of the world, save those who from the soul confess you to be  Mother of God, for we have gained you, who truly gave birth to God, as an  invincible protection.</span><br>
Another, of Cross and Resurrection.  <span class="black">&#920;&#949;&#959;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#962; &#963;&#959;&#965;  &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8051;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">Deceived by the food from the  tree, disobeying your command, O Lord, supremely good, our Ancestor sank down  into corruption; but through the Cross you brought him up again to his former  beauty, O Saviour, when you were obedient to the Father.<br>
By  your death, O Good One, death&rsquo;s might disappeared, a source of life gushed up  for us and we were given immortality. And so with faith we worship your Burial  and your Resurrection, through which, as God, you enlightened all things.</span><br>
Theotokion<br>
<span class="normal">The  Lord who dwells in heaven and the maker of all things dwelt ineffably in your  womb, O All-unblemished, glorifying you as higher than the heavens and holier  than the Ranks of immaterial powers. Therefore we on earth now call you blessed.</span><br>
Another, of the Mother of God. <span class="black">&#932;&#8183;  &#952;&#949;&#8055;&#8179; &#966;&#8051;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#953;  &#963;&#959;&#965;. </span><br>
<span class="normal">Shining  radiantly with purity you became a divine dwelling for the Master, for you  alone were declared to be truly Mother of God, as you carried him as an infant  in your arms.<br>
Wearing  the spiritual beauty of the loveliness your soul, you bore the title Bride of  God, sealed by virginity as holy, and flooding the world with the light of your  purity.<br>
Let  the community of the impious who do not expressly proclaim you to be God&rsquo;s pure  Mother lament, for you were revealed to us as Gate of divine light that  scatters the gloom of offences.</span><br>
Ode 6. Irmos. <span class="black">&#932;&#959;&#8166;  &#946;&#8055;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#8052;&#957;  &#952;&#8049;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#957;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">Watching  life&rsquo;s sea rising with a tempest of temptations, fleeing to your calm haven, I  cry out to you, &lsquo;Bring my life up from corruption, O Most merciful&rsquo;.</span><br>
Troparia<br>
<span class="normal">When  you were crucified with the nails, Master, you wiped the curse against us,  while when pierced in the side by the lance you tore up Adam&rsquo;s record of our  debt and freed the world.<br>
Adam,  when tripped up by deceit, was brought down to the pit of Hades, but you, by  nature God and compassionate, came down to search for him and, bearing him on  your shoulders, raised him with yourself.</span><br>
Theotokion<br>
<span class="normal">All-pure  Lady, who gave birth for mortals to the Lord, our helmsman, calm the unstable  and dread tumult of my passions and grant calm to my heart.</span><br>
Another, of Cross and Resurrection.  <span class="black">&#931;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#967;&#8051;&#952;&#951;,  &#7936;&#955;&#955;&rsquo; &#959;&#8016; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8051;&#963;&#952;&#951;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">The  multitude of Hebrews killed Christ and the Prophets, for as it was not afraid  of old to kill Prophets, rays of truth, so now, like those of old, overcome by  envy they killed the Lord, whom the Prophets once proclaimed; but for us his  death has become our life.<br>
You  were confined but not held fast by a grave, O Saviour, for though you willingly  tasted death, O Word, but as immortal God you arose, raising the prisoners in  Hades with you and giving the women joy in place of their former grief.</span><br>
Theotokion<br>
<span class="normal">&lsquo;The  form of your flesh appeared dishonoured and deceased to mortals at the time of  your Passion, although by the nature of your Godhead you revealed to David that  you are fair in your beauty; but with the rod of your Kingship you smash the  strength of your enemies&rsquo;, said the Pure Virgin, &lsquo;my Son and my God, and  arise&rsquo;.</span><br>
Another, of the Mother of God. <span class="black">&#932;&#959;&#8166;  &#946;&#8055;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#8052;&#957;  &#952;&#8049;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#957;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">Moses,  great among the Prophets, described you as Ark, Table, Lampstand and Jar,  symbolically depicting the incarnation from you of the Most High, O Virgin  Mother.<br>
Death,  Adam&rsquo;s condemnation, becomes a corpse, corruption too is abolished, when it  attacks your fruit, Sovereign Lady, for you gave to birth to Life that ransoms  from corruption those who sing your praise.<br>
The  law grew weak and the shadow passed away when grace that surpasses mind and  understanding shone out for me, the birth of our God and Saviour from you,  Virgin highly praised.</span><br>
Kontakion. <span class="black">&#932;&#8052;&#957;  &#8017;&#960;&#8050;&#961; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">With  his life-giving hand, Christ God, the Giver of life, raised all from the murky  vaults below and gave resurrection as the prize to mortal clay; for he is the  Saviour of all, resurrection and life, and the God of all that is.</span><br>
The Ikos.<br>
<span class="normal">Your  Cross and Burial, O Giver of life, we the faithful praise and worship, for you  bound Hades, O Immortal, as God all-powerful, you raised the dead with you, you  smashed the gates of Hades and destroyed Death&rsquo;s might as God. Therefore we  born of earth with love glorify you who rose, destroyed the might of the  all-destroying foe, raised all who believe in you, redeemed the world from the  arrows of the serpent and as all-powerful redeemed us from the error of the  foe. Therefore we devoutly sing the praise of your Resurrection, through which  you saved us as the God of all that is.</span><br>
Ode 7. Irmos. <span class="black">&#916;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#946;&#8057;&#955;&#959;&#957;  &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957;  &#954;&#8049;&#956;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957;. </span><br>
<span class="normal">An  Angel made the furnace moist with dew for the godly Youths, while God&rsquo;s command  consuming the Chaldeans persuaded the tyrant to cry out, &lsquo;&#914;lessed are you, God of our  Fathers&rsquo;.</span><br>
Troparia <br>
<span class="normal">Lamenting  at your Passion, the sun robed itself in darkness, Master, and in broad day  quenched its light over all the earth, crying out, &lsquo;Blessed are you, the God of  our fathers!&rsquo;<br>
The  powers below the earth clothed themselves in light, O Christ, at your condescension;  while the Forefather appeared filled with gladness, dancing he leapt with joy  as he cried out, &lsquo;Blessed are you, the God of our fathers!&rsquo;</span><br>
Theotokion.<br>
<span class="normal">Through  you, Virgin Mother, a radiant light has dawned for the whole inhabited world,  for you gave birth to God, the Creator of all things. Ask him for us, All-pure,  that there may be sent down to all the faithful his great mercy.</span><br>
Another, of Cross and Resurrection.<span class="black"> &#7946;&#966;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;  &#952;&#945;&#8166;&#956;&#945;.</span><br>
<span class="normal">O  strange conduct! The one who delivered Israel from the slavery of Pharao is  willingly crucified by him and looses the bands of his errors. To him we sing  with faith, &lsquo;God, our Redeemer, blessed are you!&rsquo;<br>
Impious  children of transgressors crucified on Calvary you, the Saviour, who smashed  gates of bronze and their bolts for the salvation us who sing, &lsquo;God, our  Redeemer, blessed are you!&rsquo;</span><br>
Theotokion.<br>
<span class="normal">By  bearing the first Eve&rsquo;s liberation, pure Virgin, you delivered Adam from the  curse, therefore with Angels we hymn you with your Son and we cry out, &lsquo;God,  our Redeemer, blessed are you!&rsquo;</span><br>
Another, of the Mother of God.<span class="black"> &#916;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#946;&#8057;&#955;&#959;&#957;  &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#964;&#8052;&#957;  &#954;&#8049;&#956;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957;. </span><br>
<span class="normal">The  furnace did not burn three youths, fore-imaging your giving birth, for the  divine fire, without burning you, dwelt in you, and taught all to sing,  &lsquo;Blessed are you, the God of our fathers!&rsquo;<br>
The  ends of the earth call you blessed, all-pure Mother, as you prophesied;  enlightened by your shining beams and grace they sing, &lsquo;Blessed are you, the  God of our fathers!&rsquo;<br>
The  most evil serpent impaled me on his deadly fangs, but your Son shattered them,  Mother of God, and gave me strength to cry out, &lsquo;Blessed are you, the God of  our fathers!&rsquo;<br>
You  alone are nature&rsquo;s mercy-seat; bearing in your arms the God who is seated on  the shoulders of the Cherubim, you cry out, &lsquo;Blessed are you, the God of our  fathers!&rsquo;</span><br>

Troparia.<br>
<span class="normal">The  people of the Jews that killed the prophets of old envy now makes into one that  kills God by hanging you on a Cross, O Word of God, whom we highly exalt to all  the ages.<br>
You  did not abandon heaven&rsquo;s vaults, and entering Hades you raised up with you all humanity  that lay in decay as it highly exalted you to all the ages.</span><br>
Theotokion.<br>
<span class="normal">From  light you conceived the Word, giver of light, and having given birth you  glorified him; for the divine Spirit dwelt in you, pure Maiden, and therefore  we sing your praise to all the ages.</span><br>

<span class="normal">Every  ear trembled to hear that the Most High had willingly come on earth to subdue  the strength of Hades through Cross and Burial, and to raise up all to cry  aloud, &lsquo;Youths bless, priests praise, people highly exalt him to all the ages.&rsquo;<br>
The  tyranny of Hades has ceased, and its palace been set at naught, for nailed to a  Cross on earth the God who is over all destroyed its power. Youths bless,  priests praise, people highly exalt him to all the ages.<br>
How  great, O Christ, is your ineffable love for humankind; how great your inexpressible  blessings! For when you saw me perishing in Hades&rsquo; prison you underwent your  Passion and delivered me, and we bless you, Master of all things, and highly  exalt you to all the ages.</span><br>

<span class="normal">Your  Son adorned you with a shining garment woven with gold as a Queen with the  radiance of the Spirit and placed you at his right hand, O All-pure. We highly  exalt him to all the ages.<br>
The  One who fixed the world by his will alone borrowed his flesh from your  immaculate womb, wishing to refashion it from on high. We highly exalt him to  all the ages.<br>
You  became a divine dwelling of the connection of the Word to me, humanity, pure  Virgin, who shine out with the radiance of virginity. Therefore we sing your  praise to all the ages.<br>
The  golden lampstand prefigured you who received the unapproachable Light that  illumines the universe with his knowledge. Therefore we sing your praise, pure  Virgin, to the ages.</span><br>

<span class="normal">It is impossible for humans to see God, on whom the  ranks of Angels dare not gaze. But through you, O All-pure, the incarnate Word  has been seen by mortals. As we magnify him, with the heavenly armies we call  you blessed.</span><br>
Troparia<br>
<span class="normal">You  remained untouched by passions, Word of God, when by flesh you became  acquainted with the passions; but you free humanity from the passions by your  Passion taking the name Passion, our Saviour, for you alone are without  passions and all-powerful.<br>
In  accepting the corruption of death, you preserved your Body without taint of  destruction; but your life-giving and divine soul, Master, was not abandoned in  Hades; but rising as from sleep you raised us with you.</span><br>

<span class="normal">Though  you descended into a tomb as mortal, O Giver of life, yet you destroyed the  strength of Hades, O Christ, and with you raised the dead that it had swallowed;  and as God you grant resurrection to all who magnify you with faith and love.<br>
Let  creation rejoice and flower like a lily, for Christ has been raised from the  dead as God. &lsquo;Where now death is your sting?&rsquo; we cry. &lsquo;Where Hades your victory?&rsquo;  The One who exalts our horn as compassionate has utterly destroyed you.</span><br>
Cross-Theotokion.<br>
<span class="normal">You  carry the One who carries all things, and you clasp in your hands as an infant  the One who delivers us from the hand of the warlike foe, immaculate Sovereign  Lady; and you see lifted up on the tree of the Cross the One who lifted us up  from the pit of wickedness.</span><br>

<span class="normal">A  star, shining out with rays of divinity, has now dawned from Jacob for those  held fast by deep darkness, through you, All-pure, Christ God, Word incarnate,  enlightened by whom, along with the heavenly hosts, we call you blessed.<br>
Strengthened  by your power and grace, fervently I offer you from the heart this song. But  accept it, pure Virgin, giving me in return grace with many lights from your undefiled  treasures.<br>
You  were declared to be the womb of the Godhead, on which the Word wove the robs of  his body, making my form divine, O Virgin; putting it on he saved all those who  from a pure mind magnify you.<br>
Now  resurrection has been granted to the dead through your ineffable and inexpressible  conceiving, all-pure Mother of God; for life clothed in flesh has shone out  from you for all, and has destroyed the gloom of death. </span><br>

Your  burial, Master, has opened Paradise to the human race, and delivered from  corruption we sing your praise, our risen God; have mercy on us.<br>
With  the Father and the Spirit let us hymn Christ risen from the dead, and let us  cry out him, &lsquo;You are our life and resurrection. Have mercy on us&rsquo;.<br>
On  the third day you rose from the tomb, O Christ, as it is written, and you  raised our Forefather with you; therefore the human race both glorifies you and  hymns your Resurrection.</span><br>
Other Stichera by Anatolios.<br>
<span class="normal">Lord,  great and fearful is the mystery of your Resurrection; for you came from the  tomb like a bridegroom from his marriage chamber, having abolished death by  death, that you might free Adam; therefore Angels dance in heaven and humankind  on earth glorifies your compassion towards us, Lover of humankind.<br>
Lawless  Jews, where are the seals, and the money you gave the soldiers? The treasure  was not stolen, but he has risen, as a mighty one; you have been put to shame,  you who denied Christ, the Lord of glory, who suffered and was buried and rose from  the dead; let us worship him.<br>
While  the sealed was sealed, how were you robbed, O Jews? You set guards and placed  seals. While the doors were shut the King came forth. Either produce him as a  corpse, or worship him as God, along with us who sing, &lsquo;Glory, Lord, to your  Cross and Resurrection!&rsquo;<br>
The  Myrrh-bearing Women came to your grave that received life, O Lord, and carrying  spices they were seeking to anoint your immaculate Body; but they found a  light-bearing Angel seated on the stone, and he addressed them and said, &lsquo;Why  do you weep for the One who poured out life for the world from his side? Why do  you seek the Immortal as a mortal in a grave? Rather run and tell his Disciples  the universal joy of his glorious Resurrection&rsquo;. With it enlighten us also, Saviour,  and grant us pardon and your great mercy.</span><br>
