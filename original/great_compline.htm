<p>The office of Compline is not sung in the Church in the Monastery of the
Lavra, but one reads it in one’s cell. In the Koinovia of Palestine, however,
Compline is sung as follows.</p>
<p>About the 12th hour of the day the Lamplighter enters and having made a
metania to the Superior he strikes the simandron 12 times and we assemble in the
Church. Each makes the prescribed metanias and we sit for a little until all, or
most, are assembled. The Priest rises from his seat and having made the
customary metania to the Abbot he gives the blessing. After the blessing by the
Priest, the Superior, or the Reader, continues</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">3 Metanias. Then the Psalms.</p>
<p>If it is the first week of Great Lent we begin at once with Psalm 69 and then
the Great Canon, which we sing in four sections Irmos by Irmos, so as to finish
on Thursday.</p>
<p>After the 6th Ode Kathismata of Compunction in Tone 6:<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on
us; for we sinners, lacking all defence, offer you, as our Master, this
supplication: have mercy on us.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Lord, have mercy on us, for in you we have put our trust. Do not be very
angry with us, nor remember our iniquities. But look on us now, as you are
compassionate, and rescue us from our enemies. For you are our God, and we are
your people; we are all the work of your hands, and we have called on your name.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Both now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<p>Open the gate of compassion to us, blessed Mother of God; hoping in you, may
we not fail. Through you may we be delivered from adversities, for you are the
salvation of the Christian race. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">After
the Canon is finished we continue with Psalm 4. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">After
the 6th Ode the Kontakion of the Great Canon</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Otherwise we begin as
follows:</p>
<p>Psalm 4<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">When I called you heard me, God of my
justice, when I was in trouble you set me at large; have pity on me and hear my
prayer. Sons of men, how long will you be heavy-hearted? Why do you love vanity
and seek lying? Know too that the Lord has made his Holy One wonderful. The Lord
will hear me when I cry to him. Be angry, and do not sin; for what you say in
your hearts, feel compunction on your beds. Sacrifice a sacrifice of justice and
hope in the Lord. Many say, ‘Who will show us good things?’ The light of
your countenance has been marked upon us, O Lord. You have given joy to my
heart, from the fruit of their corn, wine and oil they have been filled. I shall
lie down in peace and sleep at once; because you, Lord, alone have made me dwell
in hope.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 6<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger,
nor chastise me in your wrath. Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am weak; heal me
for my bones have been troubled, and my soul exceedingly troubled; but you,
Lord, how long? Turn back, O Lord, deliver my soul; save me for your mercy’s
sake. For in death no one remembers you; and in Hell who will confess you? I
have toiled in my groaning, every night I shall wash my bed and drench my couch
with my tears. My eye has been troubled through anger, I have grown old among
all my foes. Depart from me all you who work iniquity, for the Lord has heard
the voice of my weeping. The Lord has heard my supplication, the Lord has
accepted my prayer. Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled, let them
be turned back and speedily be utterly ashamed.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 12<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">How long, O Lord, will you finally
forget me? How long will you turn your face from me? How long shall I lay plans
in my soul, griefs in my heart day and night? How long will my foe be exalted
against me? Look on me, hear me, Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes lest I sleep in
death. Let my enemy never say, ‘I have prevailed against him’. Those who
trouble me will rejoice if I slip. But I have hoped in your mercy. My heart will
be glad in your salvation; I shall sing to the Lord my benefactor and chant to
the name of the Lord most high.</p>

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 24</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
To you, O Lord, I have lifted up my soul. My God, I have trusted in you, do not
let me be shamed for ever. Do not let my foes laugh at me; for all who wait
patiently for you will not be shamed; let those who transgress without cause be
shamed. O Lord, let me know your ways, and teach me your paths. Guide me into
your truth and teach me, for you are God my Saviour, and I have waited patiently
on you all the day. Remember your pity, Lord, and your mercies, for they are
eternal. Do not remember the sins and follies of my youth, according to your
mercy remember me, on account of your goodness, O Lord. The Lord is good and
upright, therefore he will give laws to those who sin in the way. He will guide
the meek with judgement, he will teach the meek his ways. All the Lord’s ways
are mercy and truth, for those who seek his covenant and his testimonies. For
your name’s sake, O Lord, be merciful to my sin, for it is great. Who is a man
who fears the Lord? He will give him laws in the way which he has chosen. His
soul will dwell among good things and his seed will inherit the earth. The Lord
is the strength of those who fear him, and his covenant will show them this. My
eyes are ever toward the Lord, for he will draw my feet out of the snare. Look
on me and have mercy on me; for I am alone and poor. The afflictions of my heart
have been multiplied; bring me out of my troubles. See my humiliation and my
toil, and forgive all my sins. See my foes, for they have been multiplied, and
have hated me with an unjust hatred. Guard my soul and deliver me; let me not be
shamed, for I have hoped in you. The innocent and upright have joined themselves
to me, because I have waited patiently for you, O Lord. O God, redeem Israel
from all his afflictions.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 30<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">In you, O Lord, I have hoped, let me
not be put to shame for ever, in your justice deliver me, and rescue me. Incline
your ear to me, make haste to rescue me. Be for me a God who is my defender, and
a place of refuge to save me. For you are my strength and my refuge, and for
your name’s sake you will guide me and nourish me. You will bring me out of
this snare which they have hidden for me, for you are my defender, O Lord. Into
your hands I will entrust my spirit. You have redeemed me, Lord God of truth.
You have hated those who preserve vanities to no purpose. But I have hoped in
the Lord. I will rejoice and be glad in your mercy. For you have seen my
humiliation, saved my soul from constraints. You have not shut me into the hands
of enemies; you have set my feet on a broad place. Have mercy on me, Lord, for I
am afflicted; my eye is troubled with anger, my soul and my belly. For my life
is spent with grief, and my years with groanings. My strength has grown weak
through poverty, and my bones have been troubled. I have become a reproach to
all my foes, and even more so to my neighbours; an object of fear to my
acquaintances. Those who saw me fled from me. I have been forgotten from the
heart like a corpse. I have become like a broken vessel, for I have heard the
mockery of many who dwell round about. When they gathered together against me,
they laid plans to take my soul. But I have hoped in you, O Lord; you are my
God; my lot is in your hands. Deliver me from the hands of my foes, and from
those who persecute me. Make your face shine on your servant, save me in your
mercy. O Lord, may I not be put to shame, for I have called upon you. Let the
impious be put to shame; let them be brought down to Hell. Let the deceitful
lips be speechless, which speak iniquity against the just, with arrogance and
contempt. How great is the multitude of your goodness, O Lord, which you have
hidden for those who fear you; which you have wrought for those who hope in you,
in the sight of the children of men. You will hide them in the secrecy of your
countenance, from the tumult of men. You will shelter them in a tabernacle from
the contradiction of tongues. Blessed is the Lord, for he has made his mercy in
a fortified city. But I said in my ecstasy, ‘I am cast away from the presence
of your eyes’. Therefore you have heard the voice of my prayer, when I called
to you. Love the Lord all you his saints, for the Lord seeks truth, and will
repay those who act with arrogance. Take courage, and let your heart be strong,
all you who hope in the Lord.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 90<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">One who dwells in the help of the Most
High will live under the protection of the of the God of heaven; will say to the
Lord, ‘You are my protector and my refuge, my God, and I shall hope in him’.
For he will deliver you from the snare of hunters, and from the word which
troubles. He will overshadow you with his wings, and beneath his feathers you
will hope; his truth will encircle you with a shield. You will not be afraid of
terror by night, of the arrow that flies by day. Of the thing that prowls in the
darkness, of mishap and the noonday devil. A thousand may fall at your side, and
ten thousand at your right, but it will not come near you. But with your eyes
you will observe, and see the reward of sinners. For you, Lord, are my hope, you
have made the Most High your refuge. Evils will not approach you, nor a scourge
draw near your dwelling. Because he has given orders to his Angels about you, to
guard you in all your ways. They will bear you on their hands, lest you dash
your foot against a stone. You will walk on asp and basilisk, and trample down
lion and dragon. ‘Because he hoped in me, I shall deliver him; I shall shelter
him, because he knew my name. He will cry to me, and I shall hear him, I am with
him in trouble; I shall rescue him and glorify him. I shall fill him with length
of days, and show him my salvation’.</p>

<p>Having you, Mother of God, as the hope which cannot be put to shame, I shall

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Prayer of Saint Basil the Great</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Lord, Lord, who deliver us from the arrow that flies by day, deliver us also
from every deed that walks in darkness. Accept the lifting up of our hands as an
evening sacrifice. Grant that we may also pass through the stadium of night
without blame, untried by evils, and deliver us from every trouble and from the
fear that comes to us from the devil. Grant our souls compunction, our thoughts
care concerning the examination in your dread and just judgement. Nail down our
flesh from fear of you, and deaden our members upon earth, that in the calm of
sleep, we may be made bright in the contemplation of your judgements. Take from
us every unseemly imagination and harmful desire. Raise us up at the hour of
prayer, strengthened in the faith and advancing in your commandments; through
the good-pleasure and goodness of your only-begotten Son, with whom you are
blessed, together with your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and
always and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p>Psalm 50<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Have mercy on me O God, in your great
mercy. In accordance with the multitude of your compassion blot out my offence.
Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I
acknowledge my wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you only I have
sinned and done what is evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your
words, and win when you are judged. For see, in wickedness I was conceived, and
in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have loved truth: you have shown me the
hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I
shall be cleansed; you will wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. You
will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been humbled will
rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not
cast me out from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give
me back the joy of your salvation, and establish me with a sovereign Spirit. I
will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God,
the God of my salvation, deliver me from bloodshed, and my tongue will rejoice
at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips: and my mouth will declare your
praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it; you will not
take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a
broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your
good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well
pleased with a sacrifice of justice, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then
they will offer calves upon your altar.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Psalm 101<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord hear my prayer, and let my cry
come to you. Do not turn your face from me In the day I am in tribulation
incline your ear to me. In the day I call upon you, be swift to hear me. For my
days have vanished like smoke, and my bones have been burnt up like brushwood. I
have been smitten like grass, and my heart has been dried up, so that I have
forgotten to eat my bread. My bones have stuck to my flesh, from the sound of my
groaning. I have become like a desert pelican; like an owl on a building. I have
kept vigil, and become like a sparrow, alone upon a house-top. All day my
enemies have reviled me, and those that praised me have sworn an oath against
me. I have eaten ashes as my bread, and mixed my drink with weeping. From the
presence of your wrath and your anger, for having lifted me up you have cast me
down. My days have declined like a shadow, and I have been dried up like grass.
But you, Lord, abide for ever, and your memorial to generation and generation.
You will arise and take pity on Sion, for it is time to take pity on her, for
the time has come. For your servants have been well-pleased with her stones and
they will take pity on her dust. And the nations will fear your name, Lord, and
all the kings of the earth your glory. For the Lord will build up Sion, and
appear in his glory. He has looked on the prayer of the humble, and has not
despised their supplication. Let this be written for another generation, and a
people that is being created will praise the Lord. For the Lord has leaned down
from his holy height, he has looked from heaven upon the earth. To hear the
groaning of those in fetters, to free the children of the slain. To announce the
name of the Lord in Sion, and his praise in Jerusalem. When peoples are gathered
together, and kings to serve the Lord. He answered him in the way of his
strength. Tell me the fewness of my days. Do not lead me away half way through
my days. Your years are for generations of generations. At the beginning it was
you, Lord, who laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works
of your hands. They will be perish, but you endure; they will all grow old as a
garment. And you will roll them up like a cloak, and they will be changed; but
you are the same, and your years will not fail. Your servants’ children will
have their dwelling: and their seed will be guided for ever.</p>

<p>Prayer of Manasses, King of Judea.<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord Almighty, the God of our Fathers,
of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and of their just seed; who made the heaven and the
earth with all their array; who shackled the sea by the word of your command;
who shut up the deep and sealed it with your dread and glorious name; before
whom all things shudder and tremble in the presence of your power; for the
majesty of your glory cannot be borne, and the wrath of threat to sinners is
irresistible, and the mercy of your promise is measureless and unsearchable. For
you are the Lord most high, compassionate, long-suffering and full of mercy, and
you repent over the evils of mankind. You, Lord, according to the multitude of
your goodness, have appointed repentance and forgiveness to those who have
sinned against you, and in the multitude of your pities, you have decreed
repentance unto salvation for sinners. You therefore, Lord God of Powers, did
not appoint repentance for the just, for Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who did not
sin against you, but you have appointed repentance for me a sinner, because I
have sinned above number of the sand of the sea. My iniquities have been
multiplied, Lord, my iniquities have been multiplied, and I am not worthy to
raise my eyes, and to see the height of heaven, because of the multitude of my
unjust deeds. I am bowed down by a heavy iron fetter, so that I cannot lift my
head and there is no respite for me; because I have provoked your wrath and done
what is evil in your sight, not doing your will nor keeping your commands. And
now I bow the knee of my heart, praying for the goodness which is from you: I
have sinned, Lord, I have sinned, and I recognise my iniquities; but I ask with
supplication: Forgive me, Lord, forgive me, and do not destroy me with my
iniquities, do not be wrath for ever, do not lay up evils for me, nor condemn me
to the lowest parts of the earth: for you are God, the God of the penitent, and
in me you will show all your goodness; for you will save me who am unworthy
according to your great mercy, and I will praise you continually all the days of
my life. For all the power of heaven praises you, and yours is the glory to the
ages of ages. Amen.</p>

<p>The following Theotokia are sung:</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">On Monday and Wednesday:</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Loving Mother of God Most High, you are the defender of all who take refuge
under your mighty hand; for we sinners, ever bowed down by many offences, have
no other mediation with God in dangers and afflictions. Therefore we fall before
you: Deliver you servants from every peril.</p>

<p>As she looked on your unjust slaughter, O Christ, the Virgin lamented and
cried out to you: My sweetest Child, how are you dying unjustly? You hung the
earth upon the waters, how are you hanging on a tree? Do not, I beg, leave me,
your mother and servant, behind alone, most merciful Benefactor.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>And all having received pardon from the Superior, we go back to our cells,
where we say the following prayer.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">In
practice this prayer is said in the Church by the Reader</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>
<p>To those who hate us and wrong us, Lord, give pardon. To those who do good,
do good. To our brethren and kinsfolk grant their requests that are for
salvation and eternal life. Visit those in sickness and give them healing. Pilot
those at sea. Journey with those who journey. Fight beside our Sovereign. Grant
forgiveness of sins to those who serve us and have mercy on us. On those who
have asked for our prayers, unworthy though we are, have mercy according to your
great mercy. Remember, Lord, our fathers and brethren who have fallen asleep
before us and give them rest where the light of your face shines. Remember,
Lord, our brethren in captivity, and rescue them from every peril. Remember,
Lord, those who make offerings and care for beauty in your holy churches and
give them their requests which are for salvation and eternal life. Remember too,
Lord, us your humble and unworthy servants, and guide us in the path of your
commandments; at the prayers of your most pure Mother, our Lady, Mother of God
and Ever-Virgin Mary, and all your Saints; for you are blessed to the ages of
ages. Amen.</p>

<p>There, we have set out accurately one day of the holy Fast and put down with
our love the quantity of psalmody and the prostrations that have been prescribed
by the holy Fathers. It is not allowed to cheat over these, or to defraud the
holy lawgiver. The total number of prostrations in Church for the night and day
office, excluding the Midnight Office, is three hundred. We have received the
tradition in Palestine also to chant the Psalter in our own cells, those who
can, the whole Psalter once every twenty four hours, others three times in the
week, others twice. Each is make the number of prostrations that the Superior
has given him according to his own ability.</font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
