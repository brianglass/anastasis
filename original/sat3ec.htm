<p>Greatest wonder: a Virgin gives birth, and that which was born is God before the ages.
Manifest the giving birth, that which was accomplished was beyond nature. O fearsome
Mystery! What was apprehended remains ineffable, and that which was contemplated is not
understood. Blessed are you, most pure Maiden, daughter of Adam the earthborn, and
manifested as Mother of God Most High. Implore him that our souls may be saved.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Tone 3.</p>

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>I shall remember your name in
every generation and generation.</p>

<p>Pure Virgin, we know you to be the spiritual Ark that bears the Tables written by God,
for us the Lawgiver and Creator. Intercede with him that our souls may be saved.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>Listen, daughter, and see, and
incline your ear; and forget your people and your father&#146;s house.</p>

<p>God the Word, by nature beyond contemplation, who dwelt in your womb and took on flesh,
revealed you to be Heaven upon earth, pure Virgin. And you, who knew not wedlock, rain
down upon all an immortal dew.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The rich among the people of the land
will entreat your favour.</p>

<p>By your intercessions we have gained salvation, because through them, O Virgin, we ever
escape from dangers and the squall of temptations. And so we ask, do not cease to
intercede for us, that our souls may be saved.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Theotokion</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">.</p>

<p>Through you, Mary most pure, we know refashioning and a second life for human nature:
the Creator of creation who was kneaded in your womb and who raised us up from Hades and
form death and has granted us eternal life to cry out to you, Ever-virgin; &#145;Hail, who
joined together things below with those of heaven. Hail, the hope of all the ends of the
earth, protection and assistance. Hail, who by the Resurrection of your Son make radiant
the universe and grant the world his great mercy&#146;.</p>

<p>After the Opening Psalm and the first Kathisma of the Psalter, a</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><font color="#FF0000">t</font> Lord I have cried&#133;, </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">we insert 10 Stichera, and we sing 7
Resurrection Stichera and 3 of the Saint of the day, or 4 and 6 if the Saint is
&#145;feasted&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Resurrection Stichera. Tone 3.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>By your Cross, Christ Saviour, death&#146;s might has been abolished, the devil&#146;s
deception destroyed, while the human race, saved by faith, each evening offers you its
hymn.</p>

<p>By your Resurrection, Lord, the universe has been filled with light and Paradise has
been opened again, while all creation as it sings your praise, each evening offers you its
hymn.</p>

<p>I glorify the power of the Father and the Son, and I praise the authority of the Holy
Spirit, undivided, uncreated Godhead, consubstantial Trinity, that reigns from age to age.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Other Stichera, by Anatolios.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>We worship your precious Cross, O Christ, and we praise and glorify your Resurrection,
for by your stripes we have all been healed.</p>

<p>We praise the Saviour who took flesh from the Virgin; for he was crucified for us and
rose on the third day, granting us his great mercy.</p>

<p>Going down to those in Hell, Christ proclaimed the good tidings, saying, &#145;Be of
good courage; now have I conquered! I am the Resurrection; I will bring you up, abolishing
the gates of death&#146;.</p>

<p>We who stand unworthily in your most pure house sing an evening hymn, as we cry out of
the depths, &#145;Christ God, who enlightened the world by your Resurrection on the third
day, deliver your people from the hand of your foes, O Lover of mankind&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>How should we not marvel at your Offspring, who is both God and man, all-honoured one?
For without knowing man, O all-blameless, you gave birth in the flesh to a Son without
father, begotten from the Father before the ages without mother, in no way undergoing
change, or mixture or separation, but preserving intact the identity of either nature.
Therefore, Sovereign Lady, Virgin Mother, implore him that the souls may be saved of those
who with right belief acknowledge you as Mother of God.</font></p>

<p>After the Entrance and </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">O Joyful Light&#133;, </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">the designated Monk makes a metania to the
Superior and sings the Prokeimenon of the day.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Lord is King: * he has robed himself in majesty</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse 1: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The Lord has robed and girded
himself with power.</font></p>

<p>Verse 2:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>He has made the world firm;
it will not be shaken.</font></p>

<p>Then the usual Litany,</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Grant Lord&#133; </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">etc. and after the Ekphonesis we sing the
idiomel Sticheron of the Saint of the Monastery as we process into the Narthex. After the
usual prayers we return to the Church singing the</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Resurrection Aposticha. Tone 3.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>By your passion, O Christ, you darkened the sun, and by the light of your Resurrection
you made the whole universe radiant. Accept our evening hymn, O Lover of humankind.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">In Alphabetical Order.</p>

<p>Verse 1: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The Lord is King: he has robed
himself in majesty. The Lord has robed and girded himself with power.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="5" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>G</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">racious Lord, your Rising that received life
has enlightened the world, and recalled your own fashioning which had become corrupt. And
so, delivered from Adam&#146;s curse, we cry, &#145;All-powerful Lord, glory to you!&#146;</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse 2:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>He has made the world firm;
it will not be shaken.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="5" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>H</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">owbeit that as God you are unchanging, yet
by suffering in the flesh you changed. Creation, unable to bear seeing you hanging on a
cross, was shaken with fear, and it groaned as it sang the praise of your long-suffering;
but having descended into Hell, you arose on the third day, granting life to the world and
your great mercy.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse 3:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>Holiness befits your house, O
Lord, to length of days.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="5" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>I</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">n order to ransom our race from death, O
Christ, you underwent death; and rising on the third day from the dead you raised with
yourself those who acknowledged you as God, and you enlightened the world. Lord, glory to
you!</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>By the Father&#146;s will, without seed you conceived from the divine Spirit the Son of
God, who from before the ages is from the Father without mother. But you gave birth in the
flesh and suckled as a babe him who for our sake had come from you without father.
Therefore do not cease to intercede that our souls may be delivered from dangers.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Apolytikion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Let everything in heaven rejoice, let everything on earth be glad, for the Lord has
shown strength with his arm; by death he has trampled on death; he has become the
first-born of the dead; from the bowels of Hades he has delivered us; and granted the
world his great mercy.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Virgin Mother of God, we praise you as the means of the salvation of our race; for your
Son and our God, who through the Cross accepted suffering in the flesh he had taken from
you, has redeemed us from corruption, for he loves mankind.</font>
