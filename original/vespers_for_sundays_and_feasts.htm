<p ALIGN="CENTER">VESPERS FOR SUNDAYS AND FEASTS</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="5">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>This translation of the Office of Vespers for Sundays and Feasts is intended 
as a practical edition for use in church, or by groups and individuals who wish 
to pray using the traditional prayers of the Church. The rubrics are therefore 
reasonably full, though it is not practical to cover every possible situation 
that may arise. </p>
<p>The underlying Typikon is that of the Holy Mountain of Athos and in most 
parishes some curtailment may be called for, such as the omission of the reading 
of the First Kathisma of the Psalter. On the other hand, the common practice of 
omitting most of the verses of the Lamp-lighting Psalms is most regrettable and 
should be avoided if possible.</p>
<p>There are a number of differences in Russian use, but these are mostly minor. 
For example, before the Prokeimenon the Priest greets the People, as at the 
Liturgy, and the Prokeimenon itself is a dialogue between the Deacon and Choir, 
and not between the Canonarch or Reader and the Singers, as in Athonite use. <i>
O Joyful Light</i> and <i>Now, Master</i> are usually sung by the Choir rather 
than being recited by the Superior. Other differences have more to do with the 
fact that most Russian churches celebrate a highly abbreviated ‘All-night Vigil’ 
on Saturday evenings, rather than Vespers only.</p>
<p>Technical jargon has been kept to a minimum, but a few words are explained in 
a short Glossary at the end. In the text these are underlined. There is as yet 
no generally agreed practice as to which technical terms should be anglicised 
and which left in their Greek or Slav dress. As in Church Slavonic, no doubt 
some words will be retained in their Greek form, e.g. <i>Kathisma</i>, while 
others will in the end be anglicised, e.g. <i>prostration</i> for a full <i>
metania.</p>
</i>
<p>The Psalms have been translated from the Septuagint because this has been the 
Church’s Psalter for nearly two thousand years and the prayers and hymns of the 
Church are frequently little more than a mosaic of words and phrases from it. 
The use of any other Psalter obscures or destroys many of these intentional 
echoes and cross references. Since this is a practical edition scriptural and 
other references have not been given in footnotes. In the future it may be 
possible to provide an edition with these, together with a brief commentary.</p>
<p>For completeness, we have included the text of the Ninth Hour, which should 
immediately precede Vespers.</p>
<p>In an Appendix we note the differences for the celebration of Daily Vespers, 
since these are not numerous. Another Appendix gives the ending of Vespers on 
Sundays in Lent. The details of Daily Vespers in Lent can be found&nbsp; by 
clicking the following hyperlink <a href="lenten_offices.htm">Lenten Offices</a>. 
As it is easy with modern equipment to produce this separately, we believe it is 
preferable to do so, rather than have a book where every other paragraph begins 
‘But if it is…’.</p>
<p>The text of the Litanies and other hymns and prayers which occur in the 
Divine Liturgy are taken from the bilingual edition of the Liturgy published 
with the blessing of the Archbishop of Thyateira and Great Britain.</p>

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>After the Dismissal of the Ninth Hour the Priest and Deacon, having made a <u>
metania</u> to the Bishop’s stall, venerated the icons and bowed to the two 
Choirs, enter the Sanctuary by the side doors. They make three bows to the Holy 
Table and the Priest kisses the Holy Table and the Gospel.</p>
<p>Then, vested in the <u>Epitrachelion</u>, he opens the curtain of the Holy 
Doors and, standing uncovered in front of the Holy Table, gives the blessing as 
follows:</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Then the Superior, or the appointed person, reads the Opening Psalm, one of 
the ‘<u>Gerontika</u>’, as follows:</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Come, let us worship and fall down before the King, our God.<br>
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ the King, our God.<br>
Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, the King and our God.</p>

<p>Psalm 103</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><br>
Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you have been greatly magnified. You 
have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping yourself in light 
as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his upper 
chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the 
wind, making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing 
the earth on its sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a 
cloak, is its mantle; waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they 
will flee; they will quail at the voice of your thunder. The mountains will rise 
and the plains descend to the place which you established for them. You fixed a 
limit that they will not pass, nor will they return to cover the earth. You send 
out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the mountains. They will 
give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await them to 
quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling: 
and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the 
earth will be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for 
the cattle, and green herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the 
earth, and wine makes glad the human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, 
and bread strengthens the human heart. The trees of the plain will be satisfied, 
the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There the sparrows will build their 
nests; the heron’s dwelling is at their head. The high mountains are for the 
deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun 
knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night, in which 
all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to 
seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they 
will lie down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring 
until evening. How your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have 
made them all, and the earth was filled with your creation. See, this great, 
wide sea; there there are creeping things without number, living creatures small 
and great. There ships go to and fro; this dragon which you fashioned to sport 
in it. All things look to you to give them their food in due season. When you 
give it them, they will gather it.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>If the<u> Anixantaria </u>are to be sung, the Reader only reads as far as 
this.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><b>
<p>When you open your hand </b>all things will be filled with goodness. But when 
you turn away your face they will be troubled. You will take away their spirit, 
and they will perish and return to their dust. You will send forth your spirit, 
and they will be created, and you will renew the face of the earth. May the 
glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his works. He 
looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they 
smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. 
May my words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O 
that sinners might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no 
more. Bless the Lord, my soul!</p>

<p>While the Opening Psalm is being read the Priest, bareheaded and standing in 
front of the Holy Table, says quietly the following Prayers at the Lighting of 
the Lamps, having first blessed the Deacon’s <u>Sticharion</u> and <u>Orarion</u> 
as usual.</p>
<p>1st Prayer<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><b>O </b>Lord, compassionate and 
merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy, listen to our prayer and attend to 
the voice of our supplication. Make for us a sign for good. Guide us in your 
way, to walk in your truth. Make glad our hearts to fear your holy Name, because 
you are great and do wondrous things. You alone are God, and there is none like 
you, O Lord, among gods: powerful in mercy and loving in strength to help and to 
console and to save all who hope in your holy Name.</p>
<p>For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and 
the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>2nd Prayer<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, do not rebuke us in your anger, 
nor chastise us in your wrath, but deal with us in accordance with your 
kindness, physician and healer of our souls. Guide us to the harbour of your 
will. Enlighten the eyes of our hearts to the knowledge of your truth and grant 
that the rest of the present day and the whole time of our life may be peaceful 
and without sin, at the prayers of the holy Mother of God and of all the Saints.</p>
<p>For yours is the might and yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory 
of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of 
ages. Amen.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>3rd Prayer<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord our God, remember us, sinners and 
your unprofitable servants, as we call upon your holy Name, and do not put us to 
shame from the expectation of your mercy, but graciously grant us, Lord, all the 
requests that are for salvation, and count us worthy to love and to fear you 
from our whole heart, and in all things to do your will.</p>
<p>For you, O God, are good and love mankind, and to you we give glory, to the 
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. 
Amen.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>4th Prayer<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">O Lord, who are praised by the holy 
Powers with never silent hymns and unceasing songs of glory, fill our mouth with 
your praise to give majesty to your holy Name, and give us a part and an 
inheritance with all who fear you in truth and who keep your commandments, at 
the prayers of the holy Mother of God and of all your Saints.</p>
<p>For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and 
the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>5th Prayer<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, Lord, who uphold the universe by 
your immaculate hand, who are long-suffering towards us all and who repent of 
evils, remember your acts of compassion and your mercy. Visit us in your loving 
kindness and grant that for the rest of the present day we may escape the 
manifold wiles of the evil one, and, by the grace of your All-holy Spirit, keep 
our life free from assault.</p>
<p>By the mercy and love for mankind of your Only-begotten Son, with whom you 
are blessed, together with your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and 
for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>6th Prayer<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">O<b> </b>God, great and wonderful, who 
order the universe with inexpressible loving-kindness and rich providence; who 
have granted us also the blessings of this world and brought us near to the 
promised Kingdom through the blessings that have been bestowed on us already; 
who have made us turn aside from every evil during that part of the present day 
which is now over, grant us also to complete what remains without blame in the 
presence of your holy glory, as we sing your praise, who alone are our God, good 
and the Lover of mankind.</p>
<p>For you are our God, and to you we give glory, to the Father, the Son and the 
Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>7th Prayer<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Great and most high God, who alone 
possess immortality, who dwell in unapproachable light, who fashioned all 
creation with wisdom, who made the separation between the light and the darkness 
and who placed the sun to have authority over the day and the moon and the stars 
to have authority over the night, who have counted us sinners worthy even at 
this present hour to come into your presence with confession and thanksgiving 
and to offer you our evening hymn of glory; do you, O Lord who love mankind, 
direct our prayer like incense before you and accept it as a savour of sweet 
fragrance. Grant us that the present evening and the coming night may be 
peaceful, clothe us with weapons of light, deliver us from every night-time fear 
and from every deed that walks in darkness. And give us sleep, which you have 
bestowed on us for our rest in our weakness, freed from every fantasy of the 
devil. Yes, Master of all things, giver of blessings, may we also be filled with 
compunction on our beds and call to mind your Name in the night, and enlightened 
by meditation on your commandments may we rise with gladness of soul to give 
glory to your loving-kindness, as we bring to your compassion supplications and 
entreaties on behalf of our own sins and those of all your people. At the 
prayers of the holy Mother of God visit them with mercy.</p>
<p>For you, O God, are good and love mankind, and to you we give glory, to the 
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. 
Amen.</p>

Of David. Untitled in the Hebrew.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Blessed is the man who has not walked in the council of the ungodly, nor 
stood in the way of sinners, nor sat on the seat of the pestilent. But his will 
is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he will meditate day and night. He 
will be like a tree that has been planted beside streams of water, which will 
give its fruit in its season, and its leaves will not fall; and whatever he does 
will prosper. Not so the ungodly, not so: but like the chaff that the wind blows 
away from the face of the earth. Therefore the ungodly will not rise in 
judgement, nor sinners in the council of the just. Because the Lord knows the 
way of the just, but the way of the ungodly will perish.</p>

A Psalm of David.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><b>
<p>W</b>hy were the nations insolent and why did the peoples meditate vain 
things? The kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were assembled together 
against the Lord and against his Christ. ‘Let us break through their bonds and 
cast away their yoke from us.’ He that dwells in heaven will laugh them to scorn 
and the Lord will mock them. Then he will speak to them in his anger and panic 
them in his fury. But I was established as king by him, on Sion his holy 
mountain announcing the Lord’s decree: The Lord said to me, ‘You are my Son. 
Today I have begotten you. Ask me, and I shall give you nations as your 
inheritance, and the ends of the earth as your possession. You will shepherd 
them with an iron rod; like a potter’s vessels you will smash them.’ And now, 
kings, understand; be corrected, all who judge the earth. Serve the Lord in fear 
and rejoice in him with trembling. Accept correction, lest the Lord be angry, 
and you perish from the right way whenever his fury is suddenly kindled. Blessed 
are all who have put their trust in him.</p>

the Lord with my voice and he heard me from his holy mountain. I lay down and

afraid of tens of thousands of people who attack me from every side. Arise,

Lord, guide me in your justice because of my foes, make my way straight before

<p>O</b> Lord my God I have hoped in you; save me from all those who persecute 
me and deliver me. Lest he ever seize me soul like a lion, when there is none to 
deliver me or save me. O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there is injustice 
in my hands; if I have repaid with evils those who repaid me, let me fall empty 
before my foes. Let the foe pursue my soul and seize it, trample down my life 
and make my glory dwell down there in the dust. Arise, Lord, in your anger, be 
exalted in the furthest boundaries of your foes. Rise up, O Lord my God, by the 
decree which you commanded, and an assembly of peoples will surround you, and 
for this return on high. The Lord will judge peoples. Judge me, Lord, according 
to my justice and according to the innocence that is in me. Let the evil of 
sinners be brought to an end and you will keep the just straight, O God the 
searcher of hearts and reins. Just my help from God, who saves the upright of 
heart. God is a judge, just and strong and patient, not producing anger every 
day. If you do not return he will burnish his sword, he has drawn and prepared 
his bow. And on it he has prepared the instruments of death, he has made ready 
his arrows for those who are burning. Behold he has been in labour with 
injustice, he has conceived toil and given birth to iniquity. He has dug a pit 
and scooped it out, and he will fall into the hole which he has made. His toil 
will return upon his own head and his injustice will come down upon his crown. I 
will give thanks to the Lord in accordance with his justice and I will sing to 
the name of the Lord Most High.</p>

How beloved are your dwellings, O Lord of powers; my soul longs and faints for 
the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh rejoiced in the living God. For 
the sparrow has found itself a house, and the dove a nest for herself, where she 
may place her nestlings: your altars, O Lord of powers, my King and my God. 
Blessed are those who dwell in your house, they will praise you to ages of ages. 
Blessed the one whose help is from you; who has placed ascents in his heart, to 
the valley of weeping, to the place he has set. For the lawgiver will give 
blessings; they will go from strength to strength, the God of gods will appear 
in Sion. Lord God of powers hear my prayer, give ear, O God of Jacob. O God our 
shield see; and look on the face of your Christ. For one day in your courts is 
far better than thousands. I chose to be cast aside in the house of my God,

You were well pleased with your land, O Lord, you turned away the captivity of 
Jacob. You forgave your people their iniquities, you covered all their sins. You 
made all your anger cease, you turned away from the anger of your rage. Turn us 
back again, O God of our salvation, and turn away your rage from us. Would you 
be angry with us for ever? Or will you prolong your wrath from generation to 
generation? O God, when you have turned us back you will make us live, and your 
people will rejoice in you. Lord, show us your mercy, and grant us your 
salvation. I will hear what the Lord will say in me; for he will speak peace to 
his people, to his holy ones, to those who turn their hearts back to him. But 
his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land. 
Mercy and truth have met, righteousness and peace have kissed. Truth has dawned 
from the earth, and righteousness has leaned down from heaven. For the Lord will 
give goodness, and our earth will give its fruit. Righteousness will walk before

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Master, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, who have long endured our transgressions, 
and brought us to this hour in which, hanging on the life-giving tree, you 
showed the good Thief the way into Paradise and destroyed death by death, have 
mercy also on us sinners and your unworthy servants. For we have sinned and 
transgressed, and are not worthy to raise our eyes and look on the height of 
heaven, because we have abandoned the way of your justice and walked in the will 
of our hearts. But we implore your unbounded goodness: spare us, O Lord, 
according to the multitude of your mercy, and save us for your holy name’s sake, 
for our days have been wasted in vanity. Rescue us from the hand of our 
opponent, forgive us our sins, slay our carnal will, so that we, having put off 
the old man, may put on the new, and live for you, our Master and Benefactor; 
and that thus following your precepts we may reach eternal rest, where those who 
rejoice have their dwelling. For you are the true joy and gladness of those who 
love you, Christ our God, and to you we give glory, together with your Father 
who has no beginning, and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and 
for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">VESPERS ON ORDINARY DAYS</p>
<p>On ordinary weekdays Vespers is celebrated as follows:</p>
<dir>
  <p>The Priest reads the seven prayers <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary and remains 
  there for the Litany of Peace. He should remain outside the Sanctuary for the 
  whole service, except for the censing of the church.</p>
  <p>He enters the Sanctuary at ‘Lord, I have cried’ for the censing of the 
  Church. This is done as usual, but the Priest vests only in the Epitrachelion.</p>
  <p>Only six stichera are sung at ‘Lord, I have cried’. Normally 3 from the 
  Paraklitiki and 3 from the Menaion. In this case it is the custom in many 
  places to sing 2 from the first set in the Paraklitiki and 1 from the second. 
  If the Saint of the day has a Doxastikon, then 6 Stichera are sung from the 
  Menaion, the 3 appointed being doubled. In this case the Theotokion is the one 
  from the Menaion.</p>
  <p>There is no Entrance, but immediately after the hymn ‘O Joyful Light’ the 
  Priest announces ‘Prokeimenon of the evening’.</p>
  <p>The Prokeimenon is followed at once by the prayer ‘Grant, Lord’ and the 
  Litany is displaced until later.</p>
  <p>The verses for the Aposticha are the following:</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">NOTE ON THE DISMISSAL</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>According to the strict Typikon only Saints who are ‘feasted’, that is those 
who have at least one doxastikon at Vespers, should be mentioned in the 
Dismissal. It is </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">not</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> 
the moment to read out all the small print from the Synaxarion. There is much 
variety in the details of the Dismissal in the various books and traditions.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">GENERAL NOTE ON THE CELEBRATION OF VESPERS</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>The liturgical books assume that the offices are sung by two choirs, that 
face each other across the church. Choir A, the right-hand choir, stands on the 
north side of the church and Choir B, the left -hand choir, on the south. Choir 
A is that of chief singer, or <i>Protopsaltes</i>, and Choir B that of the 
second singer, or <i>Lampadarios</i>. Choir A normally takes the lead. The 
letters </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">[A]</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> 
and </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">[B]</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> 
at ‘Lord, I have cried’ indicate this. This means that Choir A sings ‘Glory’ and 
the first Doxastikon and Choir B ‘Both now’ and the first Theotokion. If there 
is no special Doxastikon, as will frequently be the case on Saturday evening, 
Choir A sings ‘Glory’, Choir B ‘Both now’ and Choir A the actual 
Doxastikon/Theotokion.</p>
<p>For the singing of the Stichera, it is usual for the chief singer in each 
choir to take the first Sticheron for their side. Normally the senior person on 
each side is then asked to sing the second and the third may be offered to a 
visiting priest or distinguished visitor or singer. Any remaining Stichera are 
then shared among the other people in each choir.</p>
<p>At the Aposticha, Choir </font>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">B</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> 
sings the Doxastikon. This means that on Saturday evening Choir</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> 
B</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><b> </b>should start the Aposticha, 
since there are 4 stichera. On Weekdays there are only 3, and so Choir </font>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">A</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> 
starts the Aposticha. In this way each Choir sings one of the two Doxastika.</p>
<p>In some monasteries the ‘leading’ choir changes at Vespers each Saturday, the 
cycle beginning at the Matins of Pascha.</p>
<p>The Apolytikia are should be sung in the same way by the two Choirs.</p>
<p>On Sundays and Feasts, the ‘Resurrection’ Theotokion of the Apolytikion is 
always sung in the Tone of the </font>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">immediately preceding</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><b>
</b>Apolytikion. This means that on Saturday evening the Theotokion may not be 
the one in the Tone of the week.</p>
<p>In the monasteries of the Holy Mountain it is customary for the following 
dialogue to be added at the end of the Dismissal, before the final ‘Through the 
prayers…’:</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>[A]</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Accept, Lord, the supplication 
of us sinners, and have mercy on us.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>[B]</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> May your mercy, Lord, be upon 
us, as we have put our in hope.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>[A]</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Eternal your memory, blessed 
and ever remembered Founders.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>[B]</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Eternal your memory.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="5">
<p ALIGN="CENTER">THE NINTH HOUR</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>The Ninth Hour ends one liturgical day and Vespers begins the next. They are 
therefore normally celebrated together.</p>
<p>On days when Little Vespers is to be celebrated, the Ninth Hour is read 
immediately before it.</p>
<p>The Ninth Hour should be read in the Narthex, or Liti, if the church has one. 
If not, it is read in the church, with the Holy Doors and the curtain closed.</p>
<p>If there is no Apolytikion or Kontakion given in the Menaion, then those for 
the ordinary days of the week are used.</p>

  <p ALIGN="CENTER">GLOSSARY</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Anixantaria.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> On major feasts, and 
  especially at All-night Vigils, the closing verses of the Opening Psalm are 
  often sung to a solemn and protracted melody. The verses are ‘farced’ with 
  short hymns of praise, such as ‘Glory to you, Holy One. Glory to you, Lord. 
  Glory to you, heavenly King. Glory to you, O God. Alleluia’. The singers take 
  up the Psalm from the verse that begins ‘When you open’, in Greek <i>Anixantos 
  sou</i>, hence the name <i>Anixantaria.</p>
  </i></font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Apolytikion.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> The hymn that 
  precedes the Dismissal (Greek <i>Apolysis</i>)<i>.</i> It is the 
  characteristic hymn of the day or the feast, and is often referred to simply 
  as ‘the Troparion of the Day’. It is used at all the offices and at the 
  Liturgy.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Aposticha.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> The series of hymns 
  and alternating Psalm verses which are sung towards the end of Vespers and 
  daily Matins. In Greek <i>stichos </i>means ‘verse’.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Artoklasia.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> The ceremony of the 
  Blessing of Loaves, or Breaking (Greek <i>klasis</i>) of Bread (Greek <i>artos</i>), 
  that takes place before the <i>Apolytikion</i> at Vespers when there is a 
  Vigil. In many parishes it is nowadays celebrated on important feasts even 
  when there is no Vigil, at Vespers or Matins or even after the Liturgy. The 
  ceremony for such occasions will be found in the bilingual edition of the 
  Divine Liturgy published by the Archdiocese of Thyateira.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Canonarch.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>The monk whose 
  task it is to see that the sin<i>g</i>ers sing the correct texts in the 
  correct Tone. He also reads the verses of the Prokeimenon and similar texts</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Doxastikon.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> A hymn sung after the 
  short doxology ‘Glory (Greek ‘doxa’) to the Father and to the Son and to the 
  Holy Spirit’. It is normally sung to a slower and more elaborate melody than 
  the preceding hymns.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Epitrachelion.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Worn round the 
  neck, which is meaning of the Greek name, it is the Eastern equivalent of the 
  Western <i>stole</i>, the chief difference being that it is always joined down 
  the middle, normally with a series of ornamental studs. It is usually broader 
  then the Western <i>stole. </i>It is the characteristic priestly vestment, 
  worn only by bishops and priests. A priest should not celebrate any service 
  unless he is wearing it.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Gerontika. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">A convenient word used 
  to indicate those parts of the office which are traditionally read by the 
  Superior, or Elder (Greek <i>Geron</i>, or <i>Geronta</i>)<i>. </i>If the 
  Superior is not present they are read by the senior monk present. A visiting 
  priest or important visitor is often asked to read them.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Kathisma.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> One of the twenty 
  sections into which the Psalter is divided for liturgical purposes. The word 
  is also used for the short hymns that are sung after the reading of each <i>
  Kathisma </i>at Matins. The word is a Greek word meaning a <i>seat</i>. Each
  <i>Kathisma </i>is divided into three <i>sections</i> (Greek <i>Staseis</i>)<i>.</p>
  </i></font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Menaion. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">From the Greek word for 
  ‘monthly’. The book containing the services for days of the Month. There are 
  thus twelve volumes of the <i>Menaia</i>. For places without a full set of <i>
  Menaia</i> there exists in both Greek and Slavonic a volume containing general 
  offices for each category of Saint called the <i>General Menaion.</i> The 
  contents of the Greek and Slavonic <i>General Menaia</i> are not quite the 
  same, the Slavonic containing more offices, and texts for a full Vigil for 
  each category of Saint including the Lord and the Mother of God.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Metania.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>A low bow in 
  which the right hand touches the ground. Slavonic <i>poklon. </i>Also used for 
  a <i>prostration.</p>
  </i></font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Orarion.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>The Deacon’s 
  stole. It is worn on the left shoulder and sometimes taken across diagonally 
  under the right arm and again over the left shoulder. It is also worn crossed 
  on the back by readers and sub-deacons.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Phelonion.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> The Eastern equivalent 
  of the Western <i>chasuble.</i> The rubrics direct that the priest is to <i>
  lower the phelonion</i>, that is to let it fall over his hands, at the moment 
  of the Dismissal. This indicates that the work of the service is over, rather 
  like rolling down one’s sleeves. Russian <i>phelonia</i> often have a row of 
  buttons across the chest so that the front of the vestment can be raised or 
  lowered.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Prokeimenon.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>A refrain 
  from a Psalm, sung together with one or more verses from the Psalm, that 
  normally precedes the Readings at Vespers, Matins and the Liturgy. Originally 
  the whole Psalm was sung, hence the <i>Verse</i> is normally the first verse 
  of the Psalm. It survives every day at Vespers, even when there are no 
  readings. It is the equivalent of the Western <i>Gradual.</p>
  </i></font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Sticharion. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">A tunic-like 
  vestment, resembling the Western <i>dalmatic</i>, when worn by servers, 
  readers, sub-deacons and deacons. That of bishops and priests more closely 
  resembles the <i>alb</i>, though it is not necessarily white.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Sticheron.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> A hymn that precedes 
  or follows a verse, in Greek <i>stichos</i>, from the Psalms. At ‘Lord, I have 
  cried’ at Vespers and ‘Let everything that has breath’<i> </i>at Lauds the <i>
  stichera </i>follow the Psalm verses; at the <i>Aposticha</i> they precede 
  them.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Theotokion</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i>.</i> Most series of 
  hymns end with one to the Mother of God, the Theotokos, and so a <i>Theotokion
  </i>commonly follows the second part of the short doxology, ‘Both now and for 
  ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen’<i>, </i>and is normally sung in the same 
  Tone as the preceding Doxastikon<i>.</i> On Saturday evening, however, the <i>
  Theotokion</i> at the Entrance is always that of the Tone of the week, 
  regardless of the Tone of the Doxastikon. It is also sung again at Vespers 
  sung on the following Friday. In Russian usage this <i>Theotokion </i>is 
  called the <i>Dogmatic</i>, whereas in Greek the latter name is used for the 
  corresponding <i>Theotokion</i> at Small Vespers.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Typikon: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The rules governing the 
  celebration and for combining the different elements of the service. The book 
  containing these rules.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
  <p>Troparion.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Any hymn may be called 
  a Troparion, but the word more commonly indicates the <i>Apolytikion</i> of 
  the day or one of the stanzas of a Canon. Plural <i>Troparia.</p>
