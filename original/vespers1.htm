<p>The prophets, inspired by your Spirit, Lord, foretold that you, who cannot be
grasped, and who shone forth without beginning before the morning star from the
immaterial and bodiless womb of the Father, would become a child, incarnate from
one who did not know wedlock, joined to mortals and seen by those on earth.
Through them in your compassion count us worthy of your light, as we sing the
praise of your ineffable and holy Resurrection.</p>
<p>Prophets inspired by God preached you in word and honoured you in works, and
gathered the fruit of life without end. For steadfastly refusing, Master, to
adore Creation instead of you, the Creator, they renounced the whole world like
the Gospel says, and they were conformed to your Passion, which they had
foretold. At their intercessions, count us worthy to pass through the stadium of
self-mastery without blame, for you alone are rich in mercy.</p>
<p>Uncircumscribed, Master, in your divine nature, and incarnate in the last
times, you were pleased to be circumscribed; for in assuming flesh, you also
took on all its properties. Therefore, depicting the form of your likeness, we
give it a relative salutation and are exalted to love of you, and following the
godly traditions of the apostles, we draw from it the grace of healings.</p>
<p>The Church of Christ has received a precious adornment: the radiant
restoration of the venerable and holy ikons of Christ the Saviour, of God’s
Mother and of all the saints. Through this she is made bright and resplendent
with grace and rejects the throng of heretics as she drives them out and
joyfully gives glory to God who loves humankind, and who for her sake endured
his voluntary sufferings.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.<i> </i></font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Tone

</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>The grace of truth has shone out; the things prefigured in shadows in times
of old have now been openly fulfilled. For see, the Church is clothed in a
beauty that surpasses all earthly beauty, the physical ikon of Christ, as she
displays the type of the Tent of Witness and maintains the Orthodox faith, so
that, holding fast to the ikon of the One we worship, we may not go astray. Let
all who do not believe like this be covered with shame; but our glory is the
form of the One made flesh, which is devoutly worshipped but not made a god. As
we kiss it, let us believers cry aloud, ‘O God, save your people and bless
your inheritance’.</p>

<p>Advancing from false religion to true, and illumined with the light of
knowledge, let us clap our hands, as the psalm says, offering praise and
thanksgiving to God; and with fitting honour let us worship the sacred ikons of
Christ, of the all-pure Virgin and all the saints, whether depicted on walls,
panels or sacred vessels, rejecting the impious religion of the heretics; for,
as Basil says, the honour shown to the ikon passes to the prototype, as we ask
that at the prayers of your immaculate Mother, Christ our God, and of all the
saints, we may be granted your great mercy.</p>

<p>O new wonder, greater than all the wonders of old! For who has ever known of
a Mother has given birth without a man and carries in her arms the One who holds
all creation in his grasp? That which was conceived is the Counsel of God, whom
you, All-pure, carried as a babe in your embrace and with whom, as you have
gained a mother’s freedom to speak, do not cease to intercede on behalf of
those who honour you, that he take pity and save our souls.</p>
