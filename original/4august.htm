<p>Obedient to God the blessed Youths despised the lawless command, and being chained
undid the chains of error, and rejecting worldly honour received the honour which made
them all-glorious and brought them the enjoyment of the kingdom on high.</p>

<p>Bravely you stripped yourselves for the starting-blocks of the contest, O Saints; you
were hidden in a cave, where you implored the Lord with ceaseless entreaties to grant you
strength and power; but the Lover of mankind, by the judgements which he knows, commands
you, by divine might, to sleep in peace.</p>

<p>A mystery of mysteries is set forth by the Saints; for as when they died they were not
aware, so now when awakened they were clearly amazed; for this happened to confirm the
resurrection of the dead, that those who deny it may, when they know, be fenced in by
faith and glorify the Martyrs. </p>

<p>The seven Youths, who formerly lived for Christ by slaying the flesh, leapt up
wondrously, taking death for sleep, maintaining the doctrine of the Resurrection.</p>

<p>Jericho fell to the blast of seven trumpets; now the uprising of error has gone down to
Hell by the faith of the Champions with its seven lights and has been destroyed.</p>

<p>You Seven Holy Youths have truly received a double crown, for you laid waste error and

<p>Standing stoutly like the Maccabees of old before a tyrant&#146;s judgement seat, you
exchanged the army&#146;s perishable glory by soldiering for Christ.</p>

trampled down the godless decree; cast into the midst of fire, refreshed with dew they
sang: Blessed are you, the God of our fathers.]</p>

<p>The Youths appeared as pure and chosen vessels of Christ; through them false doctrine
was driven from the Church and true belief shone out: that there will be a Resurrection of
every soul and flesh as they were born.</p>

<p>As truly valiant before death in your struggle, Holy Youths, so again you appeared
alive after death strengthened with divine glory, devoutly confirming in yourselves the
truth of the Resurrection.</p>

<p>There will be a resurrection of spirits along with physical bodies; for as no soul is
born to come forth into the world without a body, so too outside the body no soul is

<p>1. The &#145;l&#146;, the second letter of the word &#145;Clement&#146; in Greek as in
English, is missing, because there are only eight Odes. The first three letters of the
word &#145;seven&#146; [<i>epta</i>] are also missing, which suggests that the canon
originally had nine odes. This phenomenon is frequent in the canons of the Menaia. The
Irmi would, in practice, never be sung, but we have included the full text in parentheses.</p>

<p>2. The line is a heroic hexameter, rather than an iambic trimeter. This is normal in
the last line of the verse notices for the first entry each day, which mentions the date,
as in the preceding notice for the Seven Sleepers. The language in both grammar and
vocabulary is &#145;homeric&#145;.</p>

<p>3. Since the name <i>Ia</i> means &#145;violets&#146;, there seems no reason why
&#145;Violet&#146; should not be used as an Orthodox name in English.</p>

<p>4. The Menaion has the following note: The sacred Hymnographer refers to the saying of
God&#146;s Angel to the prophet Zachary concerning Zorobabel, &#145;Why was someone
scornful over small days? They will rejoice and see the stone made of tin in the hands of
Zorobabel. These are the seven eyes of the Lord that look upon the earth&#146; [Zach.
4,10]. Anybody who wants to know more precisely the meaning of this prophetic passage
should read the commentaries of the Fathers on it.</font>
