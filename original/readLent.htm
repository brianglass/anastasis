<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">This page will contain the daily readings from Holy
Scripture for the weekdays of Great Lent, together with the Prokeimena and the Troparia
for the Prophecy. All the translations are made from the Christian Old Testament, commonly
known as the Septuagint, which has been the Christian text since the days of the Apostles.
It was only in the sixteenth century that certain Christian bodies rejected this text in
favour of translations based on the Hebrew Masoretic tradition. The Orthodox Churches have
never taken this step. I should perhaps stress that <font color="#FF0000"> these translations are provisional and
in no way to be considered as definitive</font>. Moreover they are translations
of the texts as they are used in the contemporary Orthodox Church, and are in
not intended to be translations of the Old Greek, or even of the Septuagint, as
professional scholars understand these terms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">It is perhaps worth pointing out that
translating the Septuagint for use in the Orthodox Church is an exacting task
and cannot be achieved by taking an existing English version made from the
Hebrew, such as the New King James Version, or even the New Revised Standard
Version, and altering it where the manual edition of Rahlfs differs from it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">The Greek text frequently differs quite markedly
from the Hebrew and this is particularly noticeable in the prophecies of Isaias and the
book of Proverbs, both of which are used in Lent. For the latter we do not yet
have a full critical edition. Moreover, the text in the Triodion
sometimes differs from that in available editions of the Greek Bible.
Furthermore the printed editions of the Triodion differ from time to time among
themselves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">The Prokeimena that accompany the Lenten readings
form a lectio continua of the Psalter, and it is the custom on the Holy Mountain to give
out not only the Tone of the Prokeimenon, but also the number of the Psalm.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">In English the only easily available version is that
made by a pious evangelical English baronet in the nineteenth century. Unfortunately the
Greek text from which he made his version is often not that used by the Church, and his
version needs to be used with caution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><big>Rubrics in <font color="#FF0000">red</font> are taken
from the Triodion, except for those in square brackets, which are editorial and represent
the use of the Holy Mountain of Athos.</big></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><big>Because HTML does not easily accept footnotes, I have
added in <font color="#0000FF">blue</font> in square brackets a few notes on the text and
translation of the readings. Having now found a way of incorporating footnotes </big><big>directly</big><big>
from Microsoft Word, the notes to the readings for the sixth week are somewhat
fuller than those for the first five.</big></font>
