<p>With great joy, believers, let us welcome the inspired proclamation of the
Fast, as the Ninevites did of old and as prostitutes and tax collectors the
preaching of repentance by John. Through self-mastery let us prepare for
communion of the Master’s sacred mystery in Sion. Through tears let us be
cleansed before the divine Washing of the feet there. Let us pray to see there
the fulfilment of the Pascha that was a type and revelation of the true. Let us
be made ready for the worship of the Cross and the Rising of Christ our God, as
we cry out to him, ‘Do not put us to shame and deprive us of our expectation,
O Lover of mankind!’</p>

<p>Verse 1. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">To you I lift up my eyes,
to you who are enthroned in the heavens. As the eyes of servants look to the
hand of their master: or as the eyes of a maid toward the hand of her mistress,
so our eyes look to the Lord our God: until he show us his mercy.</p>

<p>How fair was your transaction, O Saints! For you gave your blood and
inherited heaven, and though tested for a moment, you rejoice eternally. Your
merchandise was truly fair! For abandoning things corruptible, you received
incorruptible and, as you dance with Angels, you sing without ceasing the praise
of the consubstantial Trinity.</p>
