<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="6" face="Book Antiqua">SERVICE<br>
OF THE LITTLE CANON OF SUPPLICATION<br>
TO THE MOST HOLY MOTHER OF GOD</font></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font size="5" face="Book Antiqua">PREFACE</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5" color="#FF0000">A</font><font face="Book Antiqua">ugust in Constantinople was a month of disease and pestilence and so
it was the custom to carry the True Cross in procession through all the quarters of the
City during the first two weeks of the month. The office for the first of the month still
commemorates this practice, as does the solemn blessing of Holy Water, which is performed
in many churches on that day, although it is the normal Orthodox custom to do so on the
first of every month. In Greek use it is the custom to sing the Office of Supplication to
the Mother of God each evening during the first fortnight of August. This may well be a
survival of the ancient practice in an adapted form.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Book Antiqua">In present practice the two Canons, the Great and the
Little, are sung on alternate evenings, but since the Typikon of the Great Church does not
prescribe the office for the 1st, in many places the Little Canon is sung on the 2nd and
the Great on the 3rd and so forth. The full rite supposes that the office is sung at
Vespers immediately after the Song of Symeon, &#145;Now, Master&#146;<i>.</i> It is the
custom in many monasteries of the Holy Mountain and elsewhere to sing the Canon of the
Mother of God from the <i>Theotokarion,</i> with its Prosomia, each weekday evening at
this point of Vespers. The Canons of Supplication replace this during the first fortnight
of August.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Book Antiqua">Use of this office is not confined to the first
fortnight of August, and so the two forms of the office are given here. It is the
equivalent of the Slav <i>Molieben</i>, but Greek use has never reduced the Canon simply
to the refrains between the troparia, omitting the troparia themselves, as in the common
Slav use. The Canon itself is used as the first canon at Matins for those feasts of Saints
on which the <i>Paraklitiki</i> is not used and which do not have a special canon to the
Mother of God.</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><strong>The present translation has been made in such a way
that it can be sung to the standard Byzantine melodies and so the text has been laid out
in accordance with the metrical structure of the original. When the texts are set out as
prose, the current Greek books use commas to indicate musical punctuation; a confusing
practice, since commas are also used for ordinary punctuation of the text. The use of the
monastery of Grottaferrata was to indicate the metrical structure with asterisks, and a
number of modern Greek books have adopted this. The hymn &#145;It is truly right&#146; and
its Megalynarion, &#145;Greater in honour&#146;, which are taken from the official
translation of the Divine Liturgy of the Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain, do
not fit exactly to the melody, but can be sung quite easily without written music by an
experienced singer. </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><strong>Clearly certain liberties have had to be taken with
the text in order to fit the translation to the strict musical forms of the original, but
we believe that no ideas have been introduced which are not in the original and we have
tried to limit additions to standard epithets and occasional synonymous expansions. The
work of translation has been done by Archimandrite Ephrem and David Melling. David Melling
has done all the work on the music, which is also available. We hope in time to publish
similar versions of the Great Canon of Supplication and of the Office of the Akathist to
the Mother of God.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><strong>It should be noted that the Office of Supplication is
celebrated for the living, and the departed should not be commemorated in the litanies.</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">During the first fortnight of August
it is sung, alternating with the Great Canon of Supplication, joined to Vespers. In this
case the opening blessing is omitted and the service begins immediately after the Song of
Symeon,</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> Now, Master, </font><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">with Psalm 142</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Then at once the
following Psalm.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><b>Psalm 142</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Lord, hear my prayer; in your truth give ear to my
supplication, and in your justice hear me. Do not enter into judgement with your servant,
for in your sight no one living can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul; humbled
my life to the ground; made me dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit in
me grew weary, and my heart was troubled within me. I remembered days of old; I meditated
on all your works. I made the works of your hands my meditation. I stretched out my hands
towards you; my soul thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord; my
spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to
the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to
me the way in which I should walk, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my
enemies, Lord; I have run to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my
God. Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land. For your name&#146;s sake, O Lord,
you will give me life. In your justice you will bring my soul out of trouble; in your
mercy slay my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul, for I am your servant.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">After the Psalm we
sing the following in Tone 4.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Lord is God, and has appeared to us. Blessed is
he who comes in the name of the Lord. </font><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">(This is sung after each of the following verses by the two choirs
alternately)</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Verse 1:</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good: his mercy endures for ever.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Verse 2</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">: All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of the Lord I drove
them back.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Verse 3:</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> This is the Lord&#146;s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Then these Troparia.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Tone 4. Lifted up on

should be replaced by one in the appropriate Tone.</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">]</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Both now. </font><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The following.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Though most unworthy, may we never by silence<br>
fail to proclaim your mighty acts and accomplishments,<br>
for if you do not stand to intercede for us all,<br>
Mother of our God, who then<br>
will preserve us in freedom?<br>
Who would have delivered us<br>
from such terrible dangers?<br>
O Sovereign Lady, from all kinds of threats<br>
you save your servants,<br>
may we not abandon you.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Then Psalm 50, read
by the Reader.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><b>Psalm 50</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with your
great mercy. According to the multitude of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me
thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my
wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you alone I have sinned and done what is
evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words and win when you are judged.
For see, in wickedness I was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have
loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will
sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will wash me and I shall be made
whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been
humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out
from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your
salvation, and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your
ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from
bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips, and my
mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it.
You will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit. A
broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good
pleasure, and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a
sacrifice of justice, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer calves upon
your altar.</font></p>
