<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Have mercy on me, O God, in
accordance with your great mercy. According to the multitude of your compassion
blot out my offence. Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from
my sin. For I acknowledge my wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against
you alone I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight, that you may be
justified in your words and win when you are judged. For see, in wickedness I
was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have loved truth; you
have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will sprinkle me
with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will wash me and I shall be made whiter
than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been
humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my
iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within
me. Do not cast me out from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from
me. Give me back the joy of your salvation, and establish me with your sovereign
Spirit. I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn to you
again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from bloodshed and my tongue
will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will
proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it.
You will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken
spirit; a broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion,
Lord, in your good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you
will be well pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt
offerings. Then they will offer calves upon your altar.</p>

into judgement with your servant: for in your sight no one living can be
justified. For the enemy pursued my soul, humbled my life to the ground. Made me
dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit grew despondent within me

swiftly, O Lord, my spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall
be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning,
for I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I should walk, for to
you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord: I have run to
you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit

<p ALIGN="CENTER" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Prayer to The Most
Holy Mother of God<br>
</b><i>by Paul, monk of the Monastery of Evergetis.</p>
</i>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Spotless, undefiled, incorrupt,
immaculate, pure Virgin, Bride of God and Lady, who by your marvellous
conceiving united God the Word with mankind and joined our rejected human nature
to the heavenly realm; the only hope of the hopeless, help of the attacked,
ready assistance of those who flee to you, and refuge of all Christians; do not
turn in loathing from me, an accursed sinner, who have made myself utterly
worthless through shameful thoughts and words and deeds, and through the sloth
of the pleasures of life have become a slave to my own will. But as Mother of
the God who loves mankind have compassion on me, a sinner and a prodigal, in
your love for mankind, and accept the prayer I offer you from polluted lips. And
using your Mother's boldness, implore your Son, our Master and Lord, that He
open to me also the compassionate heart of his goodness, and disregarding my
countless offences turn me back to repentance, and make me a tried worker of his
commandments. And, as you are full of mercy, compassion and loving-kindness, be
ever near me: in this present life a fervent helper and protector, shielding me
from the enemy's assaults and guiding me to salvation, and at the moment of my
departure watching over my wretched soul and driving far from her the dark forms
of evil demons; but on the dread day of judgement, delivering me from eternal
punishment and making me heir to the ineffable glory of your Son and our God.
All this may I obtain, my Lady, most holy Mother of God, through your mediation
and assistance; through the grace and love for mankind of your only-begotten
Son, our Lord and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ. To whom are due all glory,
honour and worship, with his Father who is without beginning and his all-holy,
good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

strengthened in your commandments, and holding firmly within us the memory of
