<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">After the divine Liturgy, with the
Priest standing in the Sanctuary, those who are to be joined take their stand before the
Holy Doors, with the man on the right and the woman on the left. On the right side of the
Holy Table are placed their two rings, one of gold and the other of silver. The silver one
towards the right and the gold towards the left, close to each other. The Priest, having
come into the narthex, signs the heads of those who are to be married three times and
gives them lighted candles. He leads them into the Church and censes in the form of a
cross.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">The Priest questions them
and asks the bride if she wishes to marry the groom, and likewise if the groom wishes to
marry the bride.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Then, if there is a Deacon, he says:</font><br>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Priest, aloud:</font><br>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Singers:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> To you, O Lord.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Priest (aloud):</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> For to you belong all glory,

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Priest says the following Prayer out loud:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Eternal God, who brought into unity what had been separated and establish an
unbreakable bond of agreement; who blessed Isaac and Rebecca, and declared them to be the
heirs of your promise; bless these servants of yours also, guiding them in every good
work.</p>

<p>Because you, O God, are merciful and love mankind, and to you we give glory, Father,
Son and Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Singers: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Amen.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Priest:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Peace to all.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Singers: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">To you, O Lord.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Priest prays:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Lord, our God, who once betrothed yourself to the Church from the nations as a pure
virgin, bless this betrothal, and unite and preserve these servants of yours in peace and
concord.</p>

<p>For to you belong all glory, honour and worship, to the Father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Singers: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Amen.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Then the Priest, having taken the rings on the dish, gives first to the man the gold
one and says three times, as he makes the sign of the Cross with the ring on his forehead:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The servant of God </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">N.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> betroths himself to the servant of God </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">M.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">,
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Then, having taken the silver ring, he does the same to the woman, saying:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The servant of God </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">N.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> betroths herself to the servant of God </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">M.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">,
in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>And when he has spoken three times to each of them he makes the sign of the Cross with
the ring on their foreheads and places the rings on their right fingers.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Then the Best Man changes the rings.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Deacon: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Let us pray to the
Lord.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Priest says this Prayer:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Lord our God, you journeyed with the servant of the Patriarch Abraham in Mesopotamia
when he was sent to obtain a wife for his lord Isaac, and by means of drawing water you
revealed that he should betroth Rebecca. Bless the betrothal of your servants </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">N</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">.
and </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">M</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">. and make firm the word that they have spoken. Confirm them
with the holy unity that comes from you. For it was you who in the beginning created male
and female, and it is by you that woman is linked to man as a helper and for the
continuation of the human race. Therefore, Lord our God, who sent truth out to your
inheritance and your promise to your servants, our fathers, your elect in every
generation, look on your servant </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">N</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">. and your servant </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">M</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">., and make firm their
betrothal in faith and concord and truth and love. For it is you, Lord, who declared that
times a pledge is to be given and made firm in everything. By a ring authority was given
to Joseph in Egypt. By a ring Daniel was glorified in the country of Babylon. By a ring
the truth of Thamar was revealed. By a ring our heavenly Father showed compassion to the
prodigal son. For he said, &#145;Put a ring on his hand and bring out and slay the fatted
calf, and let us eat and be joyful&#146;. It was your right hand, Lord, that armed Moses
at the Red Sea, for through your true word the heavens were made firm and the earth set on
its foundations. And the right hand of your servants will be blessed by your mighty word
and by your upraised arm. Therefore, Master, with your heavenly blessing now bless also
this putting-on of rings. And may an Angel of the Lord go before them all the days of
their lives. For you are the One who blesses and sanctifies all things, and to you we give
glory, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the
ages of ages.</font></p>
