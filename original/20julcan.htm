<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">The first Canon, by Monk
John, with the following acrostic, not including the Theotokia:<br>
</font><font face="Book Antiqua">Dancing I praise the wonders of Elias.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 1. Tone 2. Let us
sing to the Lord.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Chosen to sing the fire-breathing power of the wonders
of Elias, fittingly we have summoned the strength of the fire-formed and holy tongue of
the Spirit.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Be gracious, god-bearing Saint, and by the force of the
Spirit which is in you open up my narrow and ill-sounding feeble tongue, and make it clear
and distinct to sing the praise of your wonders.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You distribute gifts above nature to those who obey your
holy commandments, O Word, and through the Spirit make the gates of rain obey,
accomplishing the word that has been made strong.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion.</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><big>O only blessed one, pure and godlike treasure of purity,
purify me of the impure slime of the passions, asking pardon of my faults.</big></font></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 3. Establishing me on
the rock.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">How excellent, O Prophet, the Host who through ravens
provided for a sumptuous banquet, who alone fills everything living with good-pleasure, to
whom we cry: You are our God, and none is Holy but you, O Lord.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Gratitude to the Benefactor and Protector, who with
ineffable providence brought it to pass that widow and Prophet nourished one another, to
whom we cry: You are our God, and none is Holy but you, O Lord.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">By shutting up the clouds that bring forth showers you
stopped the rain, while for the woman of Sarepta, at a loss for nourishment, you made the
remains of her food rain drop by drop unceasingly; and so you cried: None is Holy but you,
O Lord.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You alone beyond all those from every age were counted
worthy of great things, and ones above nature; for you bore in your womb and gave a body
to God, whom all creation cannot contain. Therefore with faith we honour you as Mother of
God.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 4. I heard the
report, Lord.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You appeared clearly, O Prophet, as pruner of evil but
planter of virtue; therefore we honour you.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The widow who nourished you, O Prophet, reviled you with
words for the death of her child, hastening his rising.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">You clearly indicated the glory of the Trinity when by
breathing three times you gave the child alive to his mother.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Like a fruitful vine, Pure Virgin, you bore a cluster to
gush fourth the wine of salvation for all.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 5. Giver of light.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The Law of the Fathers showed you, Elias, to be an all
true intercessor, a worker of marvels who turned natures from their elements, and burned
up a holy sacrifice with water.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">As worshipper of the truth, all-blessed, venerable
Elias, you nobly put to shame the prophets of polluted shame, clearly indicating the power
of the Trinity.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Acting as priest, Elias, by a word of grace you
sacrificed the priests of abominations with your guiltless hands, adorned with zeal as
with a priestly robe.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 6. An abyss of sins.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Inspired, god-bearing Elias, you became a figure of
godliness and of unsullied life, a husbandman of purity and an image of Angels.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The frenzy of a woman, slayer of prophets, terrified
you, inspired Elias, and banished the one to whom had been assigned the binding and
loosing of the outpouring of the rains.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Falling to your knees, you lifted up the eye of your
mind on high, through sacred supplications bringing release you made the furrows of the
land drunk with rain.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The bush on Sinai close companion to the fire yet
unconsumed foretold you, the ever-virgin Mother, O Mary, Mother of God without bridegroom.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 7. A bush burning
with fire.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Clothed with power that was marvellously formed for you
from God, with only one meal, inspired Elias, you ended the long journey of forty days.
And so at Horeb you danced and sang: Blessed is the God of our Fathers.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">A mild and gentle breeze, not a mighty wind, nor
earthquake, nor fearsome fire, revealed the Lord to you Elias, zealous for God almighty.
And so to Jesus, the gentle, we sing: Blessed is the God of our Fathers.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Like the great Moses you were found worthy of the
manifestation of God and of prophecy, inspired Elias, anointing prophets and kings; and as
you contemplated Christ&#146;s glory on Thabor you cried out: Blessed is the God of our
Fathers.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The all-good Word of God the Father dwelt supernaturally
in your womb, O Most Pure, refashioned us and made us worthy of the life of Eden.
Therefore all we believers, worshipping you as Mother of God, raise the song: Blessed is
the God of our Fathers.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 8. The spotless body
of the pure Youths.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">At the reproof of a Prophet, Achab found the total
destruction of the race plausible as a reward for murderous defilement; but the Thesbite
from his mind that breathed fire sang this hymn to the Giver of life: Praise the Lord, you
his works, and highly exalt him to all the ages.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Fire rained from heaven for you, Elias, as God&#146;s
good servant, consuming twice fifty who attacked you; for to the One who is Lord of
ever-living life you cried out in a manner fitting God the hymn: Praise the Lord, you his
works, and highly exalt him to all the ages.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Christ, the shoot beyond godhead of the Virgin, revealed
you on Thabor as cultivator of purity, to be an initiate of the divine incarnation,
showing you in his flesh the incomprehensible light of the Godhead, as you cried out:
Praise the Lord, you his works, and highly exalt him to all the ages.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Ode 9. Blessed, all-pure.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Having lived on earth a path of life unchanged by men,
and crossed the stream of Jordan with his cloak, the Thesbite, as charioteer of the air,
through the Spirit completed the strange path of his journey to heaven.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">The Thesbite, aflame with the zeal of devotion to God,
is raised up on a chariot formed of fire; while, letting fall his cloak, he leaves behind,
doubled by divine grace, Elissaios whose notice he was not able to escape.</font></big></p>

<p><big><font face="Book Antiqua">Revealed as one who sees God the Thesbite, with Moses,
contemplates what eye has not seen, nor ear heard nor the heart of humans born of earth
considered, the incarnate Lord almighty on Thabor.</font></big></p>

<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">Theotokion</font></big></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><big>O Mother of God, who abolished the severe ancient
sentence, who set upright the Foremother, the cause reconciliation of the race to God, the
bridge to the Creator, we magnify you.</big></font></p>
