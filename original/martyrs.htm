<p ALIGN="CENTER">Tone 4. As noble among Martyrs.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>As men who soldiered well, all-praised Martyrs, for the King of Powers, you willingly
gave yourselves up to scourgings and violent death, bringing with you choirs of
fellow-martyrs; with whom, O blessed ones, you found the blessed end and bound your brows
with crowns of victory as you intercede on our behalf.</p>

<p>Smitten unyieldingly and consumed by fire, nailed to boards from every side and driven
on roads, shut up in prison and roasted on coals like a pure victim, to him who was
sacrificed for us you were offered as a sweet-smelling oblation on the altar on high,
glorious Martyrs.</p>

<p>Deprived of hands and feet, with heads cut off, racked and subjected to all other
torments, you did not deny Christ or sacrifice to wooden idols, but bidding farewell to
this temporary life you passed over, all-honoured Champions, to divine and heavenly glory.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000"> Theotokion.</font></p>

<p>I call you blessed, O All-pure, who snatched mortals from the deep of evil and despair;
I confess you, Bride of God, the ever-blessed, and I glorify, holy Virgin, your ineffable
child-bearing, because you bore the Saviour of the world and freed humanity from the
ancestral curse.</font></p>

<p>As the Virgin your Mother saw you hanged upon a cross, O Lord, she was dismayed and
gazing on you said: How have they repaid you, Master, those who enjoyed your many gifts?
But, I beg, do not leave me alone in the world; but hasten, rise again, raising the
forefathers with you.</p>

<p>The Saviour&#146;s trophy, the invincible panoply of the Cross, has been revealed to us
as a divine weapon and a source of pride, through which the victors have been crowned.</p>

<p>The persecutors of true religion laid out sword, fire, pit, cross and death for the
revered Martyrs, and drove them on towards the better life.</font></p>

<p>Empowered by your divine passion the right-victorious Martyrs destroyed the godlessness
of error with its many gods; with faith they cried: You are our God, and none is holy but
you, O Lord!</p>

<p>Sprinkled with drops of godly blood you did not share in the sacrifices of demons; you
were offered as a sacrifice to the Lord, as whole burnt offerings as you cried: None is
holy but you, O Lord!</p>

<p>Keeping you wholly dwelling in their hearts the Champions made clear true religion as
they cried: None is holy as our God; and none is righteous but you, O Lord!</font></p>

<p>The noble soldiers of Christ struggled bravely with Beliar; drowned him completely in
the streams of their blood; for crushed by stones, cut with swords, burned by fire and
flung into water they appeared manifestly wearing crowns of victory; therefore they are
honoured and glorified with faith.</font></p>

<p>The all-blameless Lamb and Virgin, when with grief of soul she saw the Son she had
borne stretched out upon a Cross, was amazed and cried out: Where, my Child, so dearly
loved, is the memory of your gifts and wonders, which the ungrateful people has enjoyed?
But now you suffer all this to save the race of mortals and I hymn your compassion.</font></p>

empurpled with the blood of martyrdom and cloaked in your grace.</p>

<p>The grace and mercy of almighty God crown the athletes, for in accordance with their
love he gave them strength through which were revealed as victors.</p>

<p>You gave the champions the Cross as a rod of power, and made them rule over their
enemies; and so we sing the praise of your divinity, O Christ.</font></p>

<p>The hearts of the godless and hostile have been wounded, for Christ, stretching the

rejoice and sing: Blessed are you, the God of our fathers.</p>

<p>The flame once bedewed the three youths in Babylon, while for the Champions the furnace
of many gods died away; therefore seeing its deception reduced to ashes they cried out:
Blessed are you, the God of our fathers.</p>

<p>Enraptured by love of you, O Christ, your Champions, as though clothed in a cloak of
flesh that felt no pain, despised agonising torments and taking their delight in you they
said: Blessed are you, the God of our fathers.</p>
