<p align="center"><big><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000">On the Nativity of the
Saviour and the vigorous pursuit of our ascetic life.</font></big></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Brethren and Fathers, already the Manifestation of
God is near and the day of joy is at the doors; for it is a great joy, such as has not
been since time began, that the Son of God has come to us, not through riddles and
symbols, as he appeared of old to the fathers, but by coming to live with us and
manifesting himself in his own person through his birth from a Virgin. There has been
nothing more blest than this in generations of generations, nothing more wonderful among
all the wonders that God has done since time began. For this reason Angels are proclaiming
the good tidings of the mystery and a star revealing that the heavenly has been brought to
birth on earth; for this reason Shepherds are running to see the salvation that has been
proclaimed, and Magi are bringing gifts fit for a king; for this reason a new song is
being sung for new events, because God, who is glorified in the highest, has appeared as
peace on earth. And the Apostle bears witness when he says, <strong><i>For he is our
peace, who has made both one, breaking down the middle wall of partition, the hostility
between us, in his flesh. He has abolished the law with its commandments and ordinances,
that he might create in himself one new humanity in place of two, thus making peace, and
might reconcile both to God in one body through the Cross, thus putting to death that
hostility through it</i>.</strong> This is what the prophets and the just since time began
desired to see, but did not see except through faith; while <strong><i>we have both seen
and our hands have touched</i></strong>, as it is written, <strong><i>concerning the Word
of life, and this life has been revealed</i>,</strong> and we have received sonship. But <i><strong>what
shall we give in return for all that the Lord has given to us?</strong> </i>Already holy
David anticipated and cried out the answer. <strong><i>I shall take the cup of salvation
and call on the name of the Lord</i></strong>. So then let us rejoice, brethren, because
we have been granted to give the Lord a return for all that he has given us. And what is
this return? The cross-bearing way of life that we have taken on, and the confession <strong><em>in</em><i>
which we stand and we boast in our hope of the glory of God</i></strong>. And this is
confessedly a witness. Meanwhile it is not for us to feast for just one day, but
throughout our life; just as those who are governed by the flesh and in thrall to the
passions are unable to feast, even if they seem to feast, nor are they at liberty, for
they are slaves of the passions <strong><i>sold under sin</i></strong>. Indeed it is
written, <strong><i>Everyone who sins is a slave of sin; but the slave does not abide in
the house for ever. The son abides for ever</i></strong>. Since then we too have been
granted to have been called sons according to grace, we remain in the house for ever, if
we hold firm the beginning of our undertaking to the end. And so, empowered by the Holy
Spirit, let us still hold to our monastic state, and <strong><i>let us consider how to
provoke one another to love and good deeds</i></strong>, to obedience, to humility, to
meekness, and let us be eager for everything which is of the best, not weakening in our
resolve, but straining ever more and more, and the more so as we see the day drawing near.
For<i> <strong>the great and manifest day of the Lord</strong></i> is drawing near, on
which the judge of all will be revealed and will appear in the glory in which he appeared
to the Apostles at his divine Transfiguration, as he brings and judges every creature and
rewards each according to its work. But may it be given to us too, with all the saints, to
see him looking upon us with a kindly face and taking us into the kingdom of heaven, by
the grace and pity and love for mankind of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom are due glory,
honour and worship with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and always and to the ages of
ages. Amen.</font></p>
