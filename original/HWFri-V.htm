<p>Psalm 103<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you have
been greatly magnified. You have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping
yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his
upper chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind,
making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its
sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle;
waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at
the voice of your thunder. The mountains rise and the plains descend to the place which
you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return
to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the
mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await
them to quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling:
and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will
be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green
herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the
human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human heart.
The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There
the sparrows will build their nests; the heron&#146;s dwelling is at their head. The high
mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the
seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night,
in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to
seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they will lie
down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How
your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth
has been filled with your creation. Also this great, wide sea; there there are creeping
things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go to and fro; this
dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to you to give them their food
in due season. When you give it them, they will gather it. When you open your hand<b> </b>all
things will be filled with goodness. But when you turn away your face they will be
troubled. You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust.
You will send forth your spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of
the earth. May the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his
works. He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they
smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. May my
words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners
might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no more. Bless the Lord, my
soul!</font></p>

Job died, old and full of days. It is written that he will rise again with those whom the
Lord raises. He is described in the Syriac book as dwelling in the land of Ausis, on the
borders of Idumea and Arabia. His name before was Jobab and he took an Arabian wife and
begot a son named Enon. He himself was the son of his father Zare, one of the sons of

<p>Reader:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>Thus says the Lord: See, my
servant will understand; he shall be exalted and glorified exceedingly. Just as there many
will be astonished at you, so your appearance will be without glory from men, and your
glory from the sons of men. So many nations will marvel at him; kings shall shut their
mouths; for that which had not been told them about him they shall see, and that which
they had not heard they shall contemplate. Who has believed what we have heard? And to
whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? We brought a report as of a child before him,
as a root out of dry ground; he had no form or glory, and we saw him, and he had neither
form nor beauty. But his form was without honour and inferior to the children of men. He
was a man in suffering and acquainted with bearing weakness, because his face has been
away, he was dishonoured and not esteemed. He bears our sins and is in pain for us. We
reckoned him to be in toil and in affliction and trouble. But he was wounded for our sins
and crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment of our peace, and by his
bruises we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; every one has gone astray in
their own way, and the Lord handed him over for our sins. And he, because of his
affliction, does not open his mouth; like a sheep he was led to the slaughter, and like a
lamb before its shearer is silent, so he does not open his mouth. In his humiliation his
judgement was taken away; who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken away
from the earth; because of the iniquities of my people he was led to death. And I will
give the evil for his burial and the rich for his death, because he practised no iniquity,
nor was there guile in his mouth. And the Lord wishes to cleanse him of his blow. If you
give an offering for sin, your soul will seed a long-lived descendence. And the Lord
wishes to take away from the toil of his soul, to show him light and to fashion him with
understanding, to justify the just one, who serves many well, and he will bear their sins.
Therefore he will inherit many and divide the spoils of the strong. Because his soul was
handed over to death, and was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of
many, and was handed over because of their iniquities. Rejoice, barren one who do not give
birth, break out and cry, you who are not in labour, for the children of the desolate are
more than those of her that has a husband.</font></p>

<p>Reader:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>Brethren, the message about
the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is
the power of God. For it is written, &#145;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the
discernment of the discerning I will thwart.&#146; Where is the one who is wise? Where is
the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the
world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God
decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. For Jews
demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block
to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and
Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God&#146;s foolishness is wiser
than human wisdom, and God&#146;s weakness is stronger than human strength. Consider your
own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many
were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to
shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is
low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are,
so that no one might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ
Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and
redemption, in order that, as it is written, &#145;Let the one who boasts, boast in the
Lord.&#146; When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come proclaiming the
mystery of God to you in lofty words or wisdom. For I decided to know nothing among you
except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</font></p>

<p>Priest: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The Reading is from the holy Gospel
according to Matthew.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">27:1-38, Lk.
23:39-43, Matt. 27:39-54, Joh. 19:31-37, Matt. 27:55-61</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>At that time all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against
Jesus, so as to put him to death. They bound him and led him away and handed him over to
Pontius Pilate, the governor. Then Judas, seeing that Jesus had been condemned, repented
and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying, &#145;I
have sinned by betraying innocent blood.&#146; But they said, &#145;What is that to us?
See to it yourself.&#146; And flinging down the pieces of silver in the temple he went
away and hanged himself. But the chief priests picked up the pieces of silver and said,
&#145;It is not permitted to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of
blood.&#146; So they conferred together and bought with them the potter&#146;s field as a
burial place for foreigners. And so that field has been called &#145;Field of Blood&#146;
until today. Then what had been said by the prophet Jeremy was fulfilled, when he said,
&#145;And the took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one who was prized, whom
they prized from the children of Israel, and gave them for the potter&#146;s field, as the
Lord had commanded me&#146;. But Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor
questioned him saying, &#145;Are you the king of the Jews?&#146; Jesus said to him,
&#145;You say so.&#146; And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders he made no
answer. Then Pilate says to him, &#145;Do you not hear how many things they are testifying
against you?&#146; But he did not answer him with s single word, so that the governor was
greatly amazed. Now on the occasion of the feast the governor was accustomed to release to
the crowd one prisoner whom they wished. They had at the time a notorious prisoner called
Barabbas. So when they had assembled Pilate said to them, &#145;Whom do wish me to release
to you? Barabbas or Jesus called Christ?&#146; For he knew that they had handed him over
through envy. But while he was seated on the tribunal, his wife sent to him saying,
&#145;Have nothing to do with that just man. For I have suffered many things today in a
dream because of him.&#146; But the chief priests and elders had persuaded the crowds that
they should ask for Barabbas. Pilate says to them, &#145;So what shall I do with Jesus
called Christ?&#146; They say to him, &#145;Let him be crucified!&#146; The governor said,
&#145;Why, what evil has he done?&#146; But they shouted even louder, saying, &#145;Let
him be crucified!&#146; So Pilate, seeing that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was
starting instead, took water and washed his hands in full view of the crowd, saying,
&#145;I am innocent of the blood of this just man. You look to it.&#146; And the whole
people answered and said, &#145;His blood be on us and on our children.&#146; Then he
released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he had scourged and handed him over to be crucified.
Then the governor&#146;s soldiers took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered the whole
cohort round him. They stripped him and dressed him in a scarlet cloak, and having woven a
crown of thorns, they placed it on his head and a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt
in front of him and mocked him, saying, &#145;Hail, King of the Jews!&#146; They spat on
him and took the reed and struck it on his head. And when they had mocked him, they took
off the cloak and dressed him in his own clothes and led him away to crucify him. As they
went out they found a Cyrenian named Simon; they forced him to carry his cross. And they
came to a place called Golgotha, which means &#145;place of a skull&#146;, and they gave
him vinegar to drink mixed with gall. And when he had tasted it he would not drink. When
they had crucified him they divided his garments, casting lots, that saying by the prophet
might be fulfilled, &#145;They divided my garments among themselves, and cast lots for my
raiment&#146;. Then they sat down and watched him there. And over his head they placed his
charge, which ran, &#145;This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.&#146; Then they crucified
with him two thieves, one on the right and one on the left. One of the criminals hanging
there blasphemed him, saying, &#145;If you are the Christ, save yourself and us.&#146; But
the other answering, rebuked him and said, &#145;Do you have no fear of God, for you are
subject to the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; but he has done amiss.&#146; And
he said to Jesus, &#145;Remember me, Lord, when you come in your kingdom.&#146; And Jesus
said to him, &#145;Amen I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.&#146; The
passers by blasphemed him, shaking their heads and saying, &#145;You who would destroy the
temple and rebuild it in three days! Save yourself. If you are the son of God, come down
from the cross.&#146; Likewise the chief priests also mocked him with the scribes and
elders and Pharisees, saying, &#145;He saved others; he cannot save himself. If he is king
of Israel, let him come down from the cross and we let us believe in him. He trusted in
God, let him now deliver him, if he wants him. For he said, &#145;I am the son of
God.&#146;&#146; The thieves too, who had been crucified with him, reviled him in the same
way. From the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said, &#145;Eli, Eli, lama
savachthani?&#146; That is, &#145;My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?&#146; Some of
those standing there when they heard said, &#145;This one is calling Elias.&#146; And one
of them ran quickly and taking a sponge filled it with vinegar, placed it on a reed and
gave it him to drink. But the rest said, &#145;Wait, let us see if Elias is coming to save
him.&#146; But Jesus, having cried out again with a loud voice, gave up the spirit. And
behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom, and the earth
was shaken and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints
who slept were raised, and coming out of their graves, after his rising they entered the
holy city and appeared to many. But the centurion and those with him watching Jesus, when
they saw the earthquake and all that was happening, were greatly afraid and said,
&#145;Truly, this was the son of God.&#146; So the Jews, that the bodies might not remain
on the cross on the Sabbath, since it was the preparation&#151;for that day was a great
Sabbath&#151;, asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be
removed. So the soldiers came and the broke the legs of the first and the other who was
crucified with him; but when they came to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead,
they did not break his legs, but one of the soldiers with a lance pierced his side, and
immediately there came out blood and water. And the one who saw it has borne witness, and
his witness is true, and he knows that he speaks the truth, that you also may believe. For
these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, &#145;Not a bone of him
will be broken&#146;. And again another scripture says, &#145;They will look on him whom
they pierced&#146;. And there were many women there also watching from a distance, who had
followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him. Among whom were Mary Magdalen and Mary the
mother of James and Joses and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. When it grew late there
came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who was himself also a disciple of Jesus. He
approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered the body to be
handed over. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in clean linen and placed it in his own new
grave, which he had hewn from the rock. He rolled a great stone to the door of the grave
and departed. But Mary Magdalen was there and the other Mary, seated in front of the tomb.</font></p>

at your departure? I magnify your sufferings and I hymn your burial, with your
resurrection, as I cry: Lord, glory to you!&#146;</font></p>
