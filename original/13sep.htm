<p>Solomon stood before the face of the Lord, in front of the whole Assembly of Israel,
and stretched out his hands to heaven and said: Lord God of Israel, there is no god like
you in heaven above or on earth below. If the highest heaven is not adequate for you, how
then this house which I have built in your name? Unless you, Lord, the God of Israel, look
upon my supplication, to hear the supplication and the prayer which your servant makes
before you this day, that your eyes be open towards this house, of which you have said
that your name will be there; to hearken to the prayer which your servant prays at this
place day and night. And may you hearken to the supplication of your servant and of your
people Israel, whatever they may pray in this place, and may you hearken in the place of
your habitation in heaven, and be gracious to them.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Chap. 3,
19-34</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>With wisdom God founded the earth; He prepared the heavens with understanding. With his
knowledge the deeps were broken open and the clouds poured down dew. My son, keep my
counsel and my thought, do not pour them away, that your soul may live and grace be around
your neck; and there shall be health for your flesh and safety for your bones; that with
confidence you may walk all your ways in peace, and your foot may not stumble. For if you
sit down, you shall be unafraid; if you slumber, you shall have sweet sleep; you shall not
fear alarm coming upon you, nor the assaults of the impious; for the Lord shall be over
all your ways and shall support your feet, so that you are not snared. Do not hold back
from doing good to the needy, whenever your hand is able to help. Do not say: Come back
again sometime, and Tomorrow I shall give: when you are able, do good, for you do not know
what the coming day will bring forth. Do not devise evils for your friend who lives near
you and trusts you. Do not quarrel with someone needlessly, lest they devise some evil
against you. Do not gain the reproaches of wicked men, nor covet their ways; for every
transgressor is unclean before the Lord, he does not take his seat among the just. The
Lord's curse is on the houses of the ungodly, but the dwellings of the just are blessed.
The Lord opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Chap. 9,1-11</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>Wisdom has built herself a house and set up seven pillars. She has slaughtered her
beasts, mixed the wine in her mixing bowl and prepared her table. She has sent out her
servants, inviting with a loud proclamation to her banquet saying: Whoever is foolish, let
him turn in here to me, and to those lacking understanding she said: Come, eat my bread,
drink the wine I have mixed for you. Abandon folly and you will live; seek sagacity that
you may have life, and correct understanding with knowledge. He who reproves wicked men
will receives from them dishonour; he who rebukes the impious will shame himself. For to
the impious rebukes are bruises. Do not rebuke the wicked, lest they hate you: rebuke a
wise man and he will love you. Give a wise man an opportunity, and he will become wiser;
instruct a just man and he will continue to receive. The beginning of wisdom is fear of
the Lord; and the counsel of saints, understanding; knowing the law is the mark of a right
mind. For by this means you will live a long time, and years will be added to your life.</font></p>
