<p>‘Let all the earth-born bearing torches, in spirit leap for joy; let the
nature of the immaterial spirits honour and celebrate the wondrous sacred
festival of God’s Mother, and let them cry: Hail, all-blessed Mother of God,
pure and ever-virgin!’</p>
<p>See, the Lamb who takes away the faults of humanity, has come, has made his
abode; and asking for Baptism he comes like a slave to the slave, as he seeks to
free us, who were enslaved to the Boaster and who had lost our former beauty.</p>
<p>God, through goodness, has appeared manifestly in a body, and he who truly
wraps the heaven in clouds is coming to wrap himself in the waters of Jordan.
Let us all now feast in advance with joy his honoured Appearing.</p>
<p>Leap for joy, and be prepared to receive the Water that springs up to eternal
life, O Jordan; you rivers dance as you now see the torrent of delight entering
the streams drying up the flood of wickedness.</p>
<p>A day of salvation has shed its rays on us, who ever sleep in the night of
the passions; for Christ the Lord, the Sun of justice, in reality and in
thought, has come to bow his head to a slave and be baptised in the flesh by his
own will.</p>

joy the mystery of the Redeemer; peoples, let us chant: Blessed are you, our
