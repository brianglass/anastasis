<p align="center"><b><font size="6">THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM</font></b></p>
<i>
<p><font size="4">Every year around Christmas reports appear in the papers or on 
television which claim to give an astronomical explanation of the Star of 
Bethlehem. They are all nonsense. St <b>John Chrysostom</b> in his homily on the 
story explains clearly why the Star could not have been a natural phenomenon, 
but that it was an angelic appearance, like the Pillar of Cloud in the Old 
Testament. The true source for the Star is in the Old Testament, in <b>Numbers 
24:17</b>, where the Seer Balaam, who came from a town on the banks of the 
Euphrates, utters his great prophecy, ‘I will point to him, but not now; I bless 
him, but he does not come near. <b>A Star shall dawn from Jacob, a Man shall 
arise out of Israel</b>’. This is what we read in the Greek Septuagint, which is 
the Orthodox text. The Hebrew has, ‘a sceptre shall arise out of Israel’. St <b>
Justin</b>, in his Dialogue with Trypho 106, cites the verse, though instead of 
‘man’ he has the word ‘ruler’, which is the word used in Matthew 2:6 in the 
citation of Micheas. <b>Origen</b> links the Magi with the prophecy of Balaam, 
adding that the prophecy of Balaam had no doubt been preserved in the east. <b>
Eusebios</b> does the same. St <b>Gregory of Nyssa</b> also links the Magi with 
the prophecy of Balaam. The real Star of Bethlehem is Christ himself, as St <b>
Amphilochios </b>explains in a Christmas sermon. Saint <b>Romanos</b> takes this 
up in his Kontakion for the Nativity, Ikos 5 (the Magi are speaking):</font></p>

<p><i><font size="4">St John Chrysostom’s words are:</font></i></p>
<p><font size="4">For if we learn what the star was, and of what kind, whether 
it was one of the common stars, or strange and quite unlike the others, and 
whether it was a natural star or a star in appearance only, we shall easily know 
all the other things too. From where will these things be clear? From the texts 
themselves. Thus, that this star was not an ordinary one, or rather not a star 
at all, in my opinion, but some invisible power transformed into this 
appearance, is in the first place evident from its course. For not one of the 
stars moves like this, but whether you take the sun, or the moon, or all the 
other stars, we see them going from east to west; but this one was carried from 
north to south – for Palestine lies south of Persia. Next, one can also see this 
from the time. For it does not appear at night, but at midday, while the sun is 
shining; and no a star can do this, not even the moon. For when the sun appears 
the moon immediately disappears. But this star overcame even the beams of the 
sun by its own splendour, appearing brighter than them. Thirdly, from its 
appearing, and disappearing. For on their journey to Palestine it appeared 
leading them, but after they reached Jerusalem, it hid itself. But when they had 
left Herod and were about to leave, it shows itself; all of which is nothing 
like the motion of a star, but of some highly rational power. It did not even 
have a direction of its own, but when they moved, it moved; when they stopped, 
it stopped, like the pillar of the cloud for the Israelites. Fourthly, one can 
see this clearly, from its way of indicating. For it did not remain high up to 
point out the place – for they couldn’t have found it from that – but it came 
down and did so. For you realise that such a small space, about the size of a 
hut, or rather of the body of a little child, could not possibly be marked out 
by a star. For because of its immense height, it could not accurately indicate 
so confined a spot, and reveal it to those who wished to see it. And this any 
one may see from the moon, which is far larger than the stars, yet seems equally 
near every one that lives on the whole wide earth. How then, tell me, did the 
star point out a spot so confined, just the space of a manger and a hut, unless 
it left that height and came down, and stood over the very head of the young 
child? And this is what the evangelist was hinting at when he said, ‘The star 
went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.’</font></font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#7f0000" size="4"><b>

large number of proofs this star is shown not to be one of the many, nor to have 
shown itself according to the order of the visible creation? </font></p>
