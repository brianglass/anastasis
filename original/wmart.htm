<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>As noble among Martyrs with the dye of your blood you made for yourself a garment of
salvation, O all-praised, and radiant by the Spirit you were betrothed to the immortal
King, who keeps you as a most fair and spotless virgin unblemished, uncorrupt to age on
age in heavenly bridal chambers.</p>

<p>Acquainted with tortures, close neighbour to fire, steadfast under the rending of the
flesh, nobly enduring the boiling of cauldrons, you were not worsted by thoughts, you did
not sacrifice to wooden idols; but bowing your neck to God, by the punishment of the
sword, bearing the wreath of victory you mounted to the heights.</p>

<p>Resplendent with the splendours of virginity, all-praised Martyr, you blazed in the
struggles of martyrdom, for you were not persuaded to worship idols, but endured the
unjust slaughter, made scarlet by your own blood; and now, wearing the garland of victory,
you stand before God, the Master, made radiant by the brightness that floods from him.</font></p>

<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>I call you blessed, O All-pure, who snatched mortals from the deep of evil and despair;
I hymn you, Bride of God, the ever-blest, and I glorify your revered and ineffable
child-bearing, for you, O Virgin, gave birth to the Saviour of the world, and freed
humanity from the ancestral curse.</font></p>

<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>When the Virgin, your Mother, saw you, Lord, hanging upon the Cross, she was amazed and
gazing intently at you she said: How have they repaid you, those who enjoyed your many
gifts, O Master? But I beg, do not leave me alone in the world; hasten to arise, raising
with you the forefathers.</p>

<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>As you now dance with the godlike ranks of the Bodiless Powers around Christ, the Cause
of all things, and clearly take delight in the divine splendour, make radiant those who
sing your praise.</p>

<p>Womanhood, by grace made manly, by divine power has through weakness cast down the
puffed up pride, which boasted immoderately of old that it could wipe out the sea.</p>

<p>Contemplating you fastened to the Cross, O Master, your far famed Martyr endured the
pain of tortures, empowered by your might, who gave strength to our nature.</font></p>

<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>Without seed by the will of the Father you conceived of the divine Spirit the Son of
God, and bore in the flesh the One who is of the Father without mother and for our sakes
of you without father.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 3.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>The divine love set alight your soul, quenched the love of the flesh and the dire heat
of torments.</p>

<p>With all-powerful strength you destroyed the head of the hostile foe, O Martyr,
enduring bravely the severing of your head.</p>

<p>The streams of your blood quenched the pyre of godlessness, watered the faithful with
rivers of true religion.</font></p>

<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>Your Champion, O Christ, nobly endured all the torments of the tyrants, trampled down
the foe of many devices, was revealed as truly victor over him and received from you,
judge of the contest, a garland of glory; and now she intercedes that we may be saved.</font></p>

<p>Show your speedy protection, your help and your mercy to your servants, O Pure Virgin,
and calm the waves of vain thoughts and raise up my fallen soul; because I know, I know,
that you have power to do whatever you will.</font></p>

<p>When she who gave you birth, O Saviour, saw you lifted up on the Tree, she lamented
with weeping and cried aloud: Alas, my sweetest Son, I am wounded in soul at seeing you on
the Cross, nailed up like a malefactor between two malefactors.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 4.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>Like wolves, O Martyr, the ill-intentioned tore you, the spotless lamb, in pieces by
tortures and perfected you as an utterly unblemished, godly sacrifice and victim to God.</p>

<p>By her martyr&#146;s resistance she routed the one who by deception tripped the first
Eve by the heel and destroyed him, proving him to be powerless, as she sang to Christ:
Glory to your power, O Lord!</p>

<p>Your heart aflame with love for the Bridegroom, you quenched the coals of error,
noble-minded Martyr with the streams of your blood, and dried up the sea of the cult of
many gods.</font></p>

<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>Without knowing wedlock you bore a child, O Virgin, and after giving birth you remained
still a Virgin; therefore, Sovereign Lady, with never silent voices and unshakeable faith
we cry to you: Hail!</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 5.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>Loving Christ, the Myrrh who was poured out, the noble-minded maiden followed him,
glorifying him in songs.</p>

<p>Wounded in soul by your beauty, O Master, the virgin sped beyond visible beauties, made
radiant by her struggle.</p>

<p>You offered yourself wholly to God, as the scarlet of virginity; perfecting the former
with the dye of your blood.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 6.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>Taking up a manly mind in a woman&#146;s body, you went out a Martyr to the combat of
the tyrants, and with the sword of endurance you slew them.</p>

<p>Still stained with drops of blood, you stand, O all-revered, before the Bridegroom,
made lovely with beauties of every kind, and you delight for ever in his beauty.</p>

<p>Wounded by divine love, you cried out: I hasten to reach Christ, who is lovely in his
beauty; therefore I endure torments, joyful with unflinching mind.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 7.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>With virgins you go bearing your torch to heaven, having bravely endured the torches of
fire, as you sang: Blessed are you in the temple of your glory!</p>

<p>Like a dowry you brought to the Bridegroom a company and people that believed in
Christ, having beaten off with your wonder-working shafts of light the blackness of error.</p>

<p>You did not flinch, but rather with manly courage, all-revered Martyr, you approached
the pyre, fully aware in soul and crying out: Blessed are you in the temple of your glory!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 8.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>You became lovely by the beauties of the marks of your sufferings, and as an incorrupt
virgin, O all-revered, you drew near to the Bridegroom, God the Word, who for our sake
became incarnate of a Virgin; to him we cry: All you his works, praise the Lord!</p>

<p>Freed from the bonds of the flesh, revered, blameless Virgin Martyr, rejoicing like a
bride you dance around the bridal chamber formed of light, stained with the scarlet blood
of martyrdom and crying: All you his works, praise the Lord!</p>

<p>You dwell with the angels in light, feasting with the ranks of virgins and the
companies of martyrs, gazing upon and contemplating his face, sharing in his radiant glory
and crying out: All you his works, praise the Lord!</font></p>

<p>As a most fair and lovely and skilful Virgin, as an invincible Martyr and all-blameless
Bride of the Master, with wings of gold you have reached your goal in heaven.</p>

<p>As a spiritual wallow, turtle-dove without corruption, dove with the gilded wings of
martyrdom, who have flown to God and found your rest; we honour you.</p>

<p>Within the incorruptible bridal chamber, inspired Martyr, made ever radiant by the
beams that shine out from your Bridegroom, intercede on behalf of us who devoutly sing
your praise.</font></p>
