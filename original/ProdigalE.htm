</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>I have bowed down miserably to the pleasures of the body and I have become
wholly enslaved to the inventors of the passions; and I have become a stranger
to you, lover of humankind. But now I cry with the voice of the Profligate, ‘I
have sinned, O Christ, do not despise, for you alone are merciful’.</p>
<p>I call out, ‘I have sinned’, and I dare not even look towards the height
of heaven, O King of all; for in foolishness I alone have angered you, rejecting
your commandments. Therefore, as you alone are good, do not cast me away from
your presence.</p>
<p>At the prayers of the apostles, prophets, ascetics, honoured martyrs and the
just, pardon me all the things by which I have offended, and angering your
goodness, Christ my Lord, that I may sing your praise to all the ages.</p>

    The first sentence of this sticheron is not easy. The use of the preposition
    <i>eis</i>, ‘to’, with the passive of <i>pisteuo</i> is, so far as I can
    tell, unprecedented. The passive ‘To be entrusted with something’ would
    normally have the accusative of the thing entrusted. The Slavonic is equally
    odd. Bishop Kallistos takes the meaning to be ‘with’, which at least
    makes sense, and for the moment I follow him. It is unclear what the
    ‘sinless and living land is’. The latter adjective is not scriptural and
    the former only occurs twice, at Deuteronomy 29:18 and John 8:7; neither of
    which is of any help. The word ‘but’ in the first line is not in the
    Greek and there is a colon after ‘sin’. The latter would not make sense.
    It is simpler to take ‘having sown the ground with sin’ with what
    follows. In Slavonic ‘reaped’ and ‘piled’ are also participles,
    which all depend on ‘I was entrusted’ in the first clause. This is also
    very odd. As so often in these texts, one can ask to whom the ‘I’
    refers. In one sense it clearly refers to the writer, and hence to the
    person praying, but if the opening phrase means ‘entrusted with’, there
    could also be a allusion to Adam. There is no obvious reference to the Profligate
    Son, except, perhaps, the use of the word ‘country’. <o:p>
