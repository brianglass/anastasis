seek me out who have been led astray, O God, and have mercy on me.</p>

therefore I fall before you: I have sinned, have mercy on me, O God.</p>

<p>Who is not amazed, holy Martyrs, on seeing the good fight that you have
fought? How while still in the body you wounded the bodiless foe, confessing
Christ and armed with the Cross. Therefore you have been declared as routers of
demons and enemies of barbarians as you intercede unceasingly that our souls may
be saved.</p>

<p>Through a tree Adam became an exile from Paradise; but through the Tree of
the Cross the Thief made Paradise his home. For the one through tasting set
aside his Master’s commandment, while the other, crucified with him, confessed
the hidden God, as he cried: Remember me in your Kingdom.</p>
<p>More than all mortals on earth I have offended and I quail at the tribunal in
the other world that cannot be deceived. Keep me then uncondemned at it, most
loving Lord, rescue me from punishment, giving me repentance that washes me of
stains of every kind, as you love mankind.</p>
<p>Cherubim and Seraphim, Virtues, Thrones, Archangels, Dominations together
with Powers, holy Angels, most exalted Principalities, as you stand before the
Master ask forgiveness of faults and amendment of life for those who cry aloud
in faith: Remember us also in your Kingdom.</p>

<p>Acquainted with the fire, you burned up the brushwood of error, all-praised
Champions of Christ, and with the deluge of your blood you completely drowned
the dragon of the deep, and having carried off the victory you rejoice with the
armies on high as you intercede insistently on behalf of our souls.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.</p>
<p>Beam of the triple sun that caused the whole cosmos to appear, keep the dread
passions far from my soul, send down the dazzling radiance of your light and
pardon of faults of one who cries to you, Begetter without beginning, Son equal
in throne and Spirit: O Trinity, universally effective power, save us.</p>

<p>Pure Virgin, take pity on me, who am always sinning and am wholly in the grip
of sloth and improve by ways of repentance, giving compunction to my hardened
soul, O All-pure, the hope that cannot be shamed of those who sing your praise
with love and who cry out to Christ: Remember us also in your Kingdom.</p>
