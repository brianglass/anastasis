</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>When the judge takes his seat and the Angels stand round, the trumpet sounds
and the flame burns, what will you do, my soul, as your brought to judgement?
For then your dread deeds are present, your hidden crimes examined; and so
before the end cry out: O God have mercy on me and save me!</p>

<p>Verse: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">O Lord, do not rebuke me in
your anger, or chastise me in your wrath.</p>

and the Judge upon his throne, and I tremble at the sentence; then turn back
with speed: the judgement is unrelenting.</p>
