<p>When the doors were shut and the Disciples assembled, you suddenly entered O All
powerful One, Jesus, our God. You stood in their midst, gave them peace and filled them
with the Holy Spirit. You ordered them to remain and on no account to leave Jerusalem
until they had been clothed with power from on high. Therefore we cry to you: Our
Illumination, our Resurrection and our Peace, glory to you&#146;. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>Eight days after your Rising, Lord, you appeared to your Disciples in the place where
they were gathered, and having said to them &#145;Peace be unto you&#146;, you showed your
hands and your immaculate side to the unbelieving Disciple. But he was convinced and cried
to you &#145;My Lord and my God, glory to you&#146; (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>Thomas, called Twin, was not with them, O Christ, when you entered when the doors were
shut; therefore he did not believe what was told him confirming faith from unbelief. But
you did not refuse, O Good One, to show him your immaculate side, and the wounds in your
hands and feet. But he, having handled and seen, confessed you to be not simply God and
not merely man, and he cried &#145;My Lord and my God, glory to you&#146;. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>As the Disciples hesitated, O Saviour, you came on the eighth day, where they were
gathered. you gave them peace and cried to Thomas, &#145;Come here, Apostle, handle the
palms in which they fixed the nails&#146;. O excellent unbelief of Thomas, which led the
hearts of the faithful to knowledge; and with fear he cried, &#145;My Lord and my God,
glory to you&#146;. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</font></p>

<p>After your Rising, Lord, when your Disciples were gathered together and the doors were
shut, you stood in the midst and gave them peace. But Thomas too, convinced by the sight
of your hands and side, confessed you to be the Lord and God who saves those who hope in
you, Lover of mankind.</p>

<p>When the doors were shut, Jesus came to the Disciples and gave them fearlessness and
peace. Then he said to Thomas, &#145;Why do you not believe me, that I have risen from the
dead? Bring your hand here, and put it into my side, and see: for by your not believing,
all have learnt both my Passion and my Resurrection, and to cry, &#145;My Lord and my God,
glory to you&#146;.</p>

<p>When the doors were shut, you came O Christ to your Disciples. Thomas, by divine
dispensation, was not with them then; for he said &#145;I will not believe, unless I too
see the Master; see the side from which came the blood, the water, baptism; see the wound
by which the deep wound, humanity, was healed; see that he was not like some spirit, but
flesh and bones&#146;. O Lord who trampled on death, and satisfied Thomas, glory to you.</font></p>

<p>O Lord, when doors were shut you came in the unbearable blaze of your godhead and
standing among your Disciples you bared your side. You showed them the scars of the wounds
in your hands and feet, and banishing their dejection you cried out clearly: &#145;The way
you see me, my friends, I bear, not a spirit&#146;s nature, but the flesh which I
assumed&#146;. To the doubting Disciple, &#145;you were ready to handle me with
dread&#146;, he said, &#145;you investigate all things, come then, do not hesitate&#146;.
But he, sensing with his hand your double being, with fear cried out in faith: &#145;My
Lord and my God, glory to you.&#146;</font></p>

<p>O amazing wonder! Unbelief has engendered firm faith for Thomas, who said &#145;Unless
I see, I will not believe&#146;, having handled the side, acknowledged as God incarnate
the same Son of God: he recognised that he had suffered in the flesh; he proclaimed the
risen God and he cried in shining tones &#145;My Lord and my God, glory to you&#146;.</font></p>

<p>O amazing wonder! The grass which touched the fire is safe: for Thomas having put his
hand into the fiery side of Jesus Christ, God, was not burned up by his handling; for he
fervently changed the doubt of his soul into true faith. He cried from the depths of his
soul &#145;You are my Master and my God, you who have been raised from the dead, glory to
you.</font></p>

<p>O amazing wonder! John leaned on the breast of the Word, but Thomas was found worthy to
handle his side. But the former with awe drew thence the depths of Theology, the divine
dispensation; the latter was found worthy to initiate us, for he clearly provided proofs
of your Rising, as he cried out &#145;My Lord and my God, glory to you&#146;.</p>

<p>O lover of mankind, great and immeasurable is the multitude of your mercies; for you
endured being struck by the Jews, handled by the Apostle and investigated by those who
reject you. How did you become incarnate? How were you crucified, you who are sinless? But
make us understand, as you did Thomas, so that he cried to you &#145;My Lord and my God,

And he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death.<br>
For he shattered the doors of bronze,<br>
And smashed the bars of iron.<br>
He took them out of their troubles,<br>
And broke their chains in two.<br>
Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people,<br>
And praise him in the council of the elders.<br>
For the Lord listens to the poor,<br>
He does not despise his servants in captivity.<br>
And let them offer a sacrifice of praise, and tell what he has done with shouts of joy.<br>
The Lord awoke like a man out of sleep,and struck his enemies.<br>
For the eyes of the Lord are on those that hope in his mercy.<br>
To hear the groaning of the prisoner,<br>
To deliver those condemned to die.<br>
Let God arise and let his enemies be scattered.<br>
And let those that hate him flee from before his face.<br>
This is the day which the Lord has made,let us rejoice and be glad in it.<br>

<p>Who then preserved the Disciple&#146;s palm unmelted when it approached the fiery side
of the Lord? Who gave it daring, and gave it strength to handle bone of flame? Only that
side which was handled; for had not the side given the power, how could a hand of clay
have handled wounds which had shaken things above and things below? This grace was given
Thomas, to handle it and to cry out to Christ, &#145;You are my Lord and my God&#146;.</font></p>

<p>When the harmony of music summoned the peoples to worship the image, the Children of
David, singing the ancestral songs of Zion, broke the ominous decree of the tyrant, and
changed the flame to dew, as they sang the hymn, &#145;O highly exalted, our God and the

God&#146;s new people to rejoice, for with trembling it bears the type of the age to come,
as it completes the Eight. O highly exalted, our God and the God of our fathers. </p>

<p>Thomas the Twin, who alone was bold, and brought blessing by his faithless faith,
banished misty ignorance in all the ends of the earth by his believing unbelief; while for
himself he wove a crown as he wisely said, &#145;You are our God, O highly exalted, our
God and the God of our fathers; blessed are you&#146;.</p>

<p>Not in vain did Thomas doubt your Rising, not in vain declare, but he hastened, O
Christ, to show to all the nations that it was undoubted; and so having through unbelief
come to belief he taught them all to say, &#145;You are our God, O highly exalted, our God
and the God of our fathers; blessed are you&#146;.</p>

<p>Fearfully placing his hand, O Christ, in your life-bearing side, trembling he felt the
double force, O Saviour, of the two natures united without confusion in you, and with
faith he cried, &#145;You are our God, O highly exalted, our God and the God of our
fathers; blessed are you&#146;.</font></p>

<p>Thomas, who is also the Twin, was not present when you appeared to your Disciples, O

believe that he has risen&#146;.</p>
