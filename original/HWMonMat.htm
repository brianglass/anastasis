<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FF0000">Psalm 19</font><br>
May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob shield you.
May he send you his help from the holy place, and support you from Sion. May he remember
your every sacrifice, and accept with favour your whole burnt offering. May the Lord give
you your heart&#146;s desire, and fulfil your every purpose. We shall rejoice in your
salvation, and be magnified in the name of our the Lord our God. May the Lord fulfil all
your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ. He will hear him from his
holy heaven; in mighty acts is the salvation of his right hand. Some put their trust in
chariots and some in horses, but we will call on the name of the Lord our God. They were
fettered and fell, but we have risen and been set upright. Lord, save the king, and hear
us on the day we call upon you.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><font color="#FF0000">Psalm 20</font><br>
The king will rejoice in your power, O Lord, he will exult exceedingly in your salvation.
You gave him his heart&#146;s desire; you did not deny him the request of his lips. For
you came to meet him with blessings of goodness; you placed a crown of precious stones
upon his head. He asked you for life, and you gave him length of days for age on age.
Great is his glory because of your salvation; you will place on him glory and majesty. For
you will give him blessing for age on age, and make him glad with the joy of your
countenance. For the king puts his hope in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Most
High he will not be shaken. May your hand light upon all your enemies, and your right hand
find out all who hate you. You will make them like a blazing oven at the time of your
presence. The Lord will confound them in his wrath and fire will devour them. You will
destroy their offspring from the earth, and their seed from among the children of
humankind. Because they intended evils against you, and devised plans by which they can in
no way succeed. For you will put them to flight; among your remnants you will prepare
their presence. Be exalted, Lord, in your power; we will sing and praise your mighty acts.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4"><font color="#FF0000">Psalm 3</font><br>
Lord, why have those who afflict me been multiplied? Many rise against me. Many say to my
soul, &#145;There is no salvation for him in his God&#146;. But you, Lord, are my helper,
my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. With my voice, I cried to the Lord, and he
heard me from his holy mountain. I lay down and slept; I awoke, because the Lord will
assist me. I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who surround me. Rise,
Lord, save me, my God; because you have struck all who are vainly my foes. You have
smashed the teeth of sinners. Salvation is the Lord&#146;s, and your blessing is upon your

Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chastise me in your wrath. For your arrows have
been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a heavy hand upon me. There is no healing in my
flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in my bones on account of my sins. My iniquities
flooded over my head; like a heavy burden they weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank
and festered on account of my foolishness. I was wretched and utterly bowed down; I went
about mourning all day long. For my loins were filled with mockings, and there is no
healing in my flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated exceedingly; I howled from the
groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning was not hidden
from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and even the light of my eyes had
gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and stood against me, and those
nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life used force, and those who sought evils
for me spoke vanities, and meditated trickeries all day long. But I, like a deaf man,
heard nothing; like one who is dumb, who does not open his mouth. So I became like one who
cannot hear, and in whose mouth there are no rebukes. For in you, Lord, I have hoped; you
will answer me, O Lord my God. For I said: Let my foes never exult over me. When my foot
slipped they crowed over me. For I am ready for blows and my pain is with me continually.
For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my sin. But my enemies live and have
prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly have been multiplied. Those who repay me
with evils in place of good have slandered me, since I pursued goodness. Do not forsake
me, Lord; my God, do not go far from me. Hasten to help me, Lord of my salvation.</font></p>

O God, my God, I watch for you at dawn; my soul has thirsted for you, my flesh how often
in a desert, untrodden and waterless land. Thus I appeared before you in the holy place,
to see your power and your glory. For your mercy is better than life; my lips will praise
you. So I will bless you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands. May
my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; my mouth will praise you with joyful lips.
When I remembered you upon my bed, every dawn I meditated upon you. For you became my
helper, and in the shelter of your wings I shall rejoice. My soul clung to you; and your
right hand upheld me. But those who vainly sought my life will go down to the deepest
parts of the earth, they will be delivered to the power of the sword, they will be
portions for foxes. But the king will rejoice in God, and all who swear by him will be
praised; for the mouths of those who speak iniquities have been stopped.</font></p>

Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day, and by night also before you. Let my
prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to my supplication. For my soul was
filled with evils, and my life drew near to Hell. I was reckoned among those that go down
to the Pit; I became as one that has no help, free among the dead. Like the slain that
sleep in the tomb, whom you remembered no more; and they were cut off from your power.
They placed me in the lowest Pit; in darkness and in the shadow of death. Your wrath lay
heavy upon me, and you brought all your waves against me. You put my friends far from me,
and made me an abomination to them. I was handed over and I came out; my eyes grew weak
because of my beggary. I cried to you, Lord, all the day; I stretched out my hands towards
you. Will you work wonders for the dead; or will physicians raise them up again to praise
you? Will any declare your mercy in the tomb, or your truth in the place of destruction?
Will your wonders be known in the dark, or your justice in a land that has been forgotten?
But to you, Lord, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer will come before you. Why
have you rejected my soul, Lord; why do you turn away your face from me? I am poor and in
toils since my youth; exalted, I was humbled and brought to despair. Your fierce anger
overwhelmed me, and your terrors appalled me. They surrounded me like water all day long;
they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour you have put far from me, and
my companions because of my misery.</font></p>

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord,
O my soul, and forget none of his benefits. He forgives all your iniquities; he heals all
your diseases; he redeems your life from corruption and crowns you with mercy and
compassion; he satisfies your desire with good things; your youth will be renewed like an
eagle&#146;s. The Lord performs deeds of mercy and judgement for all who are oppressed. He
made known his ways to Moses, his wishes to the children of Israel. The Lord is
compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy. He will not always be
wrathful, nor will he be enraged for ever. He has not dealt with us according to our
iniquities, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For, like the height of heaven above
the earth, the Lord has made his mercy prevail over those that fear him. As far as the
east is from the west, so far has he taken our sins from us. As a father takes pity on his
children the Lord has taken pity on those who fear him. For he knows of what we are made;
has remembered that we are but dust. As for man, his days are but as grass, he will
blossom like a flower of the field; for when a wind has passed over it, it will be no more
and will know its place no longer. But the mercy of the Lord is for ever and ever upon
those who fear him; and his justice upon their children&#146;s children, upon those who
keep his covenant and remember his commandments to do them. The Lord has prepared his
throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Bless the Lord, all you his Angels,
powerful in strength, who perform his word, and listen to the voice of his words. Bless
the Lord, all you his Powers, his Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord, all you his
works. In every place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul!</font></p>

darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit grew despondent within me and my heart
within me was troubled. I remembered days of old, I meditated on all your works: I made
the works of your hands my meditation. I stretched out my hands towards you: my soul
thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord, my spirit has failed. Do
not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear
of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I
should walk, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord: I have
run to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit
will guide me in an upright land. For your name&#146;s sake, O Lord, you will give me

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">At that time, as Jesus was going back to the city,
he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it, and found nothing on
it, but only leaves. And he said to it, &#145;May fruit no longer come from you for
ever.&#146; And at once the fig tree was withered. When they saw it, the disciples
marvelled and said, &#145;How was the fig tree withered at once?&#146; But Jesus answered
and said to them, &#145;Amen, I say to you, if you have faith and do not hesitate, not
only will you do this to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, &#145;Be
lifted up and cast into the sea&#146;, it will be done. And everything you ask for in
prayer with faith you will receive.&#146; And when he came to the temple precinct the
chief priests and elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said, &#145;By
what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?&#146; Jesus
answered and said to them, &#145;I shall also ask you one question, and if you answer me,
I shall also tell you by what authority I do these things. John&#146;s baptism, where was
it from, from heaven or from humans?&#146; They discussed this among themselves and said,
&#145;If we say &#145;from heaven&#146;, he will say to us, &#145;Then why did you not
believe him?&#146;. But if we same &#145;from humans&#146;, we are afraid of the crowd,
for all hold John to be a prophet.&#146; So they answered Jesus and said, &#145;We do not
know.&#146; And he said to them, &#145;Nor shall I tell you by what authority I do these
things. What is your opinion? A man had two sons, and he approached the first and said to
him, &#145;My son, go and work in my vineyard today&#146;. He answered, &#145;I do not
wish to&#146;. But later he changed his mind and went. And he approached the second and
said the same to him. But he answered, &#145;Yes, sir&#146;. And he did not go. Which of
the two did the will father&#146;s will?&#146; They said to him, &#145;The first.&#146;
Jesus said to them, &#145;Amen, I say to you. The publicans and harlots are going ahead of
you into the kingdom of God. For John came to you in the way of justice, and you did not
believe him. But the publicans and harlots believed him. But even when you saw, you did
not later change your minds and believe him. Hear this parable. There was a landowner who
planted a vineyard and put a hedge round it and dug a wine press in it and built a tower.
Then he let it out to tenant farmers and went abroad. When the time of the vintage drew
near, his sent his slaves to the farmers to collect his produce. But the farmers seized
his slaves and one they flogged, one they killed and one they stoned. Once again he sent
other slaves, more than at first, and they treated them the same way. Afterwards he sent
his son to them, saying, &#145;They will respect my son&#146;. But when the farmers saw
the son they said among themselves, &#145;This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and
obtain his inheritance&#146;. And they took him and cast him outside the vineyard and
killed him. So when the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those
farmers?&#146; They said to him, &#145;He will bring those evil men to an evil end. And he
will hire out the vineyard to other farmers, who will return his produce to him at the
proper times.&#146; Jesus said to them, &#145;Did you never read in the scriptures,
&#145;The stone that the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. This is the
Lord&#146;s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes&#146;? Therefore I tell you, the
Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation that will produce its
fruits&#146;.</font></p>

Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with your great mercy. According to the multitude

me from my sin. For I acknowledge my wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you
alone I have sinned and done what is evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your
words and win when you are judged. For see, in wickedness I was conceived and in sin my
mother bore me. For see, you have loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret
things of your wisdom. You will sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will
wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness;
the bones which have been humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot
out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within
me. Do not cast me out from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give
me back the joy of your salvation, and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will
teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my
salvation, deliver me from bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you
will open my lips, and my mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a
sacrifice, I would have given it. You will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A
sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do
good to Sion, Lord, in your good pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then
you will be well pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt
