<p>Virgin maidens, having struggled valiantly for you, O Christ, were brought to the King,
rejoicing, full of gladness and overflowing with joy they drew near to you, the Tree of
Life, interceding that to our souls may be granted your peace and great mercy.</p>

<p>Virgin maidens, drawn by the sweet scent of your myrrh, followed your footsteps,
imitating your life-bearing passion that saves the soul; and they went towards the
resurrection of the dead, rejoicing in you, O Benefactor, and delighting clearly in your
beauty.</p>

<p>Virgin maidens of the foremother Eve, fittingly you are carried by a longing to be made
divine, looking towards God with unyielding purpose, and borne up by an unflinching
longing; now too intercede that to our souls may be granted peace and great mercy.</p>

<p>At the right hand of the Saviour stood the Virgins, Champions and Martyrs, clothed by
virtues with the invincible and adorned with the oil of purity and the blood of the
contest, holding their lamps and crying to him: We ran to the fragrance of your myrrh,
Christ God, because we have been wounded by your love. Do not banish us, heavenly
Bridegroom. At their intercessions, All-powerful Saviour, send down to us your acts of
mercy.]</font></p>

<p>Pure Virgin, you alone were named dwelling of the Light that dawned from the Father.
Therefore I cry out to you: Make bright with the light of the virtues my soul, darkened by
the passions, and make me dwell in shining tabernacles on the day of judgement, O
Immaculate.</font></p>

<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>You devoutly proclaimed the uncreated Trinity, glorious Martyrs, take pity on us who
honour your godly contests and your achievements, O blessed of God.</p>

<p>The Maidens, buttressed by the divine weapon of the faith, reckoned nothing to the
words of the ill-intentioned, and they underwent a tempest of torments and unjust death
for the sake of the life of all.</p>

<p>Fortified by the all-powerful strength of the Creator, the all-revered Maidens took up
a courageous resolve and trampled underfoot the great crooked dragon and dashed him to the
ground.</font></p>

<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>The lawless tyrant with lifeless thought tried to compel you terribly to deny Christ
our life, all-revered Maidens, by torturing you.</p>

<p>The choir of Martyrs reckoned nothing to the hostile instruments laid before them, as
they gazed with faith towards you, All-powerful, the one alone able to save.</p>

<p>The thrice-blessed Martyrs clearly found in heaven a treasure and an everlasting
renown, as they drew near to God.</font></p>

<p>Having struggled valiantly for the Trinity, you wounded the most crafty enemy, binding
your spirits like sisters; therefore, Champions, you entered the heavenly Bridal Chamber
with the five Virgins, and with the Angels you stand unceasingly with joy before the

<p>The all-blameless Lamb and Virgin, when with grief of soul she saw the Son she had
borne stretched out upon a Cross, was amazed and cried out: Where, my Child, so dearly
loved, is the memory of your gifts and wonders, which the ungrateful people has enjoyed?
But now you suffer all this to save the race of mortals and I hymn your compassion.</font></p>

<p>Made radiant with the beauty of the noblest contest, you were revealed as shining
lamps, Maidens of Christ, with shining rays making resplendent those who cry: Glory to
your power, O Lord!</p>

<p>You were made beautiful, O Virgins, and radiantly glorified, having loved without limit
the glorified Word, wounded by whose love you most valiantly endured the assaults of
sufferings.</p>

<p>By your intercession with Christ drive away the attack of the varied temptations and
dangers of me, who fervently celebrate with you all-festive memorial, O worthy of praise.</font></p>

<p>All-immaculate, who gave birth to life, make me live, who have been put to death by the

<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>The Martyrs, displaying a valiant intent and an invincible purpose before the judgement
seats, were wreathed with crowns of victory.</p>

<p>The Martyrs, having competed in the contests on earth, receive in the highest their
heavenly reward from you, O Giver of life.</p>

<p>Let the godly Virgins be praised with hymns as a lamp of many lights, a dwelling of
many storeys, a tabernacle of the Trinity.</font></p>

<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>Longing to see your beauty uncontrived, the Martyrs, wounded with your most sweet love,
O Word without beginning, nobly endured the bitterness of torments.</p>

<p>The all-revered Maidens blossomed like lilies in a meadow, and by the grace of the
Spirit they filled the Church with the fragrance of torments of many kinds.</p>

<p>Longing only for the immortal Bridegroom, the young Maidens, strengthened with
invisible force, outstandingly reckoned nothing to visible death.</font></p>

<p>When he ordered you to sacrifice to idols, you utterly despised the impious tyrant,
young Maidens, as you cried, &#145;God of our fathers, blessed are you!&#146;</p>

<p>Your minds aflame with rays that came from God, O all-praised, you darkened the gloom
of idols, as you cried, &#145;God of our fathers, blessed are you!&#146;</p>

<p>Not hacking off of limbs, not persecution, not affliction could in any way separate
from Christ the Martyrs, as they cried, &#145;God of our fathers, blessed are you!&#146;</font></p>

<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>Steeled by love of the Creator, you blunted the goads of the serpent, passing through
manly struggles in women&#146;s bodies, and being crowned with godly crowns.</p>

<p>Locked in combat in the midst of the ring with invisible foes, the godly Maidens with
the body routed the bodiless, as they cried, &#145;You his works, bless the Lord!&#146;</p>

<p>You have attained the Kingdom on high, noble young Maidens, where you reign with Christ
Jesus, bedecked with the marks of your torments, adorned with beauty.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 9.</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>Longing to see the beauty of the Bridegroom, with an unswerving intent towards him,
God-bearing Maidens, you contemplated immortality while in mortal bodies, therefore you
are fittingly called blessed.</p>

<p>You appeared as spotless lambs in the midst of tyrants like ferocious wolves,
overthrowing their savagery, and being brought to Christ as acceptable sacrifices.</p>

<p>Together you wove a garland that does not grow old, O Virgin. You attained divine glory
and were found worthy, as Martyrs, to obtain a truly unshakeable kingdom with the Martyrs.</p>

<p>As you have freedom of access to the Master, holy Virgins, intercede that those who
celebrate your memory with love may attain the glory of which you were found worthy and
the choir which you attained.</font></p>
