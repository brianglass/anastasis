<p>The unsetting Sun hastens to emerge from virgin loins to enlighten everything under
heaven. Let us hurry to meet him with clear eyes and pure actions; and let us now be
prepared to receive in spirit the one who comes to his own by a strange birth, as he was
well pleased; that, as he is compassionate, by being brought to birth in Bethlehem, he may
bring us back who have been estranged from the life in Eden.</p>

<p>God the Word, who rides on the backs of the Cherubim, united hypostatically to flesh,
has dwelt in an unblemished womb, become a mortal and is coming to the land of Juda to be
brought to birth. Holy Cave, be made ready as a majestic palace for the universal King;
and you, Manger, as a throne formed of fire, on which the Virgin Mary lays as a babe the
Infinite for the restoration of what he fashioned.</p>

<p>The Virgin lays you in a manger of dumb beasts, O Word of God without beginning, who
beyond understanding have accepted a beginning; for you are coming to dispel my unreason,
to which I submitted by the envy of the serpent; while you will be wrapped in swaddling
bands that you may tear apart the bands and cords of my offences, O alone Good and lover
of humankind; therefore I glorify you, I praise and worship with great joy your coming in
the flesh, through which I have been freed.</p>

<p>To no purpose and with murderous intent is Herod&#146;s Sanhedrin gathered to slay the
Lord who comes to birth; to whom we all sing: You are our God, and none is just but you, O

<p>Herod&#146;s fell council, being of a mind to fight God, thinks to slay, together with

<p>Emptying out our tears like myrrh for Christ, who is brought to birth for us in flesh,
let us purify the stains of the flesh, as in purity we approach the Immaculate and cry:
All you works of the Lord, praise the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages&#146;.</p>

<p>With tears of pitiable sorrow may we escape the tears of the dread punishment to come,
as we grasp the feet of Christ, who is placed as a babe in swaddling clothes, and cry: All
you works of the Lord, praise the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.</p>

<p>Knowing that ransom is effected by his own compassion and a fount of tears, let us
believers, washed clean through confession, approach Christ, who is brought to birth in
the flesh, as we cry: All you works of the Lord, praise the Lord, and highly exalt him to

<p>Let none be ungrateful, none full of evil jealousy of those who now bring gifts
acceptable to God instead of myrrh, gold and incense, the myrrh of virtues, as they sing
to Christ who is brought to birth: Spare our souls, Christ God, and save us.</p>

<p>Cunning Herod, hard of heart, says to the wise Magi: Go, seek the King who has now been
born, and having found him, tell me, as he meditated murder in his murderous heart. Spare
our souls, Christ God, and save us.</p>

<p>O the audacity of blind murder! therefore you forgot: that no one takes God into their

<p>&#145;With a cutting hand the Red Sea is cut, while the deep, nurse of waves, is dried
up; the same becomes at once a path for the unarmed and for the fully armed a tomb; a
song, pleasing to God, was raised: Christ our God has been greatly glorified&#146;.</p>

<p>The infinite Wisdom of God, cause of all things and origin of life, has built his own
house from a pure Mother who has not known man. For putting on a bodily temple Christ our
God has been greatly glorified.</p>

<p>God&#146;s Wisdom summons the Magi, guiding them to the mystery as first fruits of the
Nations, to nourish spiritually those who before were unreasoning at a manger of
unreasoning beasts, where a mystical table is spread, to which they hasten as they make
their way with gifts, while the star shining before them.</p>

<p>Let us listen to the sayings of the Prophets that have now been fulfilled. For the
Virgin has conceived in her womb and hurries to give birth to the One who pre-exists. The
heavens revealed him to the Magi, Angels to Shepherds as a babe made manifest.</font></p>

<p>&#145;God, who is Lord and Creator of all things, the One who is beyond passion has

flesh, he is worshipped in a paltry manger, as he cries, &#145;Eat my body, and you will
be made firm by faith&#146;.&#146;</p>

<p>Herod makes bold to slay before his time Christ who now comes to pour out his own
saving blood for the world. He rages madly before the mad rage of Pilate and so with
scarlet savagery he slaughtered multitudes of infants.</p>

<p>A foolish man said, &#145;There is no God&#146;. Filled with utter madness, he is sick

<p>The One who worked wonders and smote Egypt, rained Manna on the ungrateful people,
becomes incarnate and suckles at the breast. Seen as a little child, he flees from Herod,
borne on the Virgin Mother as on a light cloud, as Isaias, the most visionary of prophets
foresaw.</p>

<p>The pre-existent Child, King of the ages, is willingly brought to birth and is given to
us as a son. Listen, you Nations, Israel, give ear! Understand and be discomfited, for he
is with us, the One grind down and wipe out from the earth every kingdom and rule that
does not obey him.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.</p>

<p>Jew, you will be shepherded with a rod of iron, as you did not believe and resisted the
Prophets; for to the Son when he is born the Father gives Nations as his lot and the whole
earth as his possession, while you he will thrust aside, foul murderer, for you cannot be
persuaded to cry, &#145;The King of Israel, Christ, is at hand!&#146;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Both Now.</p>

<p>David, leap for joy, for Christ comes from your loins! Jesse, be glad, for your root
has flowered! Juda, from your thigh the Lord will come forth. Nations he devours, as
Balaam said. As great Isaias said, &#145;See, the all-revered Virgin will give birth to a
little child, Emmanuel&#146;.</font></p>

<p>Today a day of the forefeast of the incarnation of Christ God has shone out with the
feast of the all-praised Martyr Anastasia. See, the Virgin is approaching Bethlehem to
lay, wrapped in swaddling clothes, in a manger of irrational beasts, the Babe who has
freed us from the ancient curse and saves our souls.</p>

of me and you will rejoice and worship him as God&#146;, said the Mother of God to her own

&#145;Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you; and through you, with us&#146;.</font></p>
