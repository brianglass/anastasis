<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 1. Tone 4. The Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>&#145;You struck Egypt and drowned the tyrant Pharao in the sea, and saved a people
from slavery, as they sang Moses&#146; song of victory: For he has been glorified.&#146;</font></p>

<p>The Buried has arisen, and with him raised the human race; let all creation rejoice,
and let all the spiritual clouds to-day clearly rain down justice.</p>

<p>Having willingly accepted the cross in the flesh, you rose on the third day from the
dead, Lord, source of life, emptying Hell&#146;s storehouses and leading out the fettered
souls.</p>

<p>O Lord, who lay the beams of your chambers on the water, you are the water of life and
you granted hallowed streams to the woman of Samaria when she asked, for she recognised
your compassion.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.</p>

<p>O Trinity, Father, Son and Spirit, as maker of all things save those who glorify you
with pure faith, and grant pardon of our sins, as you are supremely good.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Willingly you were lifted up on the tree, O Word, and seeing it the rocks were rent,
and all creation was shaken, and the dead arose from the graves as from sleep.</p>

<p>When all the souls of the just saw you coming to Hell with your soul, O Word, they were
released from their eternal chains as they hymned your power beyond understanding.</p>

<p>Why are you amazed? Why with spices do you seek the Master in a grave, O Women? He has
risen, and has raised the world with himself, cried the dazzling Angel to the
Myrrhbearers.</p>

<p>As Life and the source of immortality you sat down by the source, O Merciful, and
filled with your all-wise streams the Woman of Samaria who asked and hymned you.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.</p>

<p>One God in Trinity is hymned over all, the Father, Son and divine Spirit, whom the
armies of heaven glorify in fear, as they clearly cry out: Holy, Holy, Holy, are you to
the ages.</p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Let the heavens rejoice, let all creation keep the feast: the Lord has risen and
appeared to all his wise Apostles.</p>

<p>Your power, Death, was swallowed up, when Christ died: at his Rising as from bridal
chambers the dead have come from the graves.</p>

<p>Why do you lament, O women? Why seek the immortal with spices? He has risen as he said,
the Angel cried to the Myrrhbearers.</p>

<p>To the woman of Samaria, when she asked, Lord, you gave water, the knowledge of your
might; therefore for all ages she will never thirst as she sings your praise.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.</p>

<p>O Trinity beyond being, Father, Word and divine Spirit, identical in power, together
without beginning, save us all, who in faith sing your praise.</p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>&#145;Make the light of your commandments dawn for me, O Lord, for my spirit rises
early for You, O Christ, and hymns You: for You are our God and to You I have run for
refuge, O king of peace.&#146;</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Reaching your holy grave at early dawn, the Myrrhbearers saw a shining youth, and were
amazed on learning of your divine Rising, O Christ.</p>

<p>Death has been slain, Hell taken prisoner, those in chains freed by the Resurrection of
Christ. Let us rejoice and clap our hands and radiantly keep the feast.</p>

<p>Apostles leap for joy, Angels dance, all born of earth be glad: the Lord has risen,
corruption has been banished, grief has ceased, and Adam dances.</p>

<p>O Lord, as source of life you once gave the water of forgiveness and knowledge to a
woman of Samaria when she asked: therefore we praise your inexpressible mercies.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.</p>

<p>We honour a three-personned Unity, consubstantial Trinity, Father, Word and Holy
Spirit, inseparable by nature, one God, Maker and Lord and Master of all.</p>

Jonas: May my life ascend from corruption to you, our God.&#146;</font></p>

<p>Jesu, the transgressors nailed you to a cross, and pierced you with a lance, O Christ,
and Joseph laid you for burial in a new tomb; from which you rose with glory, raising with
you all creation, which hymns your might. </p>

<p>Powerfully you smashed the bolts and gates of Hell, O Master, and rose as God, and
meeting the women you said to them: Rejoice, and you sent them to say to the Disciples:
The Living has arisen, and he has appeared giving light to the ends of the earth. </p>

<p>Why do you weep? Why bring spices as to a mortal, O women? Christ has arisen, leaving
the grave clothes behind empty, cried the youth who appeared of old flashing like
lightning; Go, announce the Resurrection to his friends. </p>

<p>Good Lord, you are an inexhaustible stream of life, an abyss of mercy. As you journeyed
you sat down by the Well of the Oath, and cried out to the woman of Samaria: Give me water
to drink, that you may receive streams of forgiveness.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.</p>

<p>With the bodiless powers, I hymn in faith the Father without beginning, and the Son
equal in majesty, and the consubstantial Spirit, one Essence, and nature and glory, and
one kingship, God and Maker of all, who holds the universe together.</p>

<p>&#145;Do not hand us over for ever, for your name&#146;s sake, do not scatter your
covenant and do not withdraw your mercy from us, O Lord the God of our fathers, highly
exalted unto the ages.&#146;</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>O merciful Christ, willingly you were numbered among the lawless at the moment of your
divine Passion; seeing it the earth was shaken and the rocks were rent by your
all-effecting wish, O Infinite, and the dead from time&#146;s beginning arose. </p>

<p>With your soul you went down to the lower regions of Hell; bravely you led out all the
prisoners that death, the bitter tyrant, held since time&#146;s beginning, as they cried
out to you, Christ our God: Glory to your dread dispensation! </p>

<p>Why do you seek the eternally living with the dead? He has risen, as he said. Here, as
you see, the graveclothes are empty, the tomb is empty, the young man who appeared said to
the Women: Go with haste, tell the Apostles. </p>

<p>You are the water of life, the Woman of Samaria cried out to Christ; therefore, O Word,
give me, who am ever thirsty, your divine grace to drink, that I may no longer, Lord Jesu,
be mastered by the drought of ignorance, but may proclaim your wonderful works.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.</p>

<p>We hymn the Father and the Son and the divine Spirit, Trinity by nature undivided,
divided by persons, one united Essence, without beginning, Maker of all and God, whom all
the ranks of heaven praise.</p>

<p>You endured death by your will, only Immortal, you took hell captive, you smashed the
gates of brass, heavenly King, and released the prisoners held there since time&#146;s
beginning, who unceasingly hymn the might of your goodness. </p>

<p>You were lifted up willingly on the Cross, O Longsuffering, and the rocks were split,
the sun was quenched, the veil of the temple was rent in two, and the earth was shaken,
and Hell, the laughing stock, trembled with fright and released all his prisoners.</p>

<p>You, Lord, the light that never sets and life of all, appeared to those sitting in
darkness; therefore when the just saw you, O Word, they leaped for joy and cried aloud:
You have come to free all from their chains; we praise your might. </p>

<p>You sat next the source at the sixth hour, O Saviour, and granted the Woman of Samaria
living water and streams of knowledge in your great compassion; with her we all cry out in
song: You works of the Lord, unceasingly bless the Lord.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.</p>

<p>We praise the Father without beginning, the Son likewise without beginning and the Holy
Spirit, the three one God without confusion, inseparable, Creator of all, identical in
power, might of sovereign freedom, and we cry out: You works of the Lord, unceasingly
bless the Lord.</p>
