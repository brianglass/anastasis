<p>‘When the golden image was being worshipped on the plain of Deïra, your
three Youths trampled down the godless decree. Cast into the midst of the fire
they were bedewed as they sang, ‘Blessed are you, the God of our Fathers’’.</p>
<p>By the wealth of your loving kindness, O Christ, you chose to approach the
waters naked, so clothing me, stripped naked by the treachery of the Boaster,
with a sacred robe. I sing the praise of your compassion and I worship your
wondrous dispensation.</p>
<p>‘What is this great dispensation of yours towards us, O Christ? What this
poverty? What this ineffable condescension beyond understanding?’ said John
when he saw you stripping yourself naked and commanding that you be baptized by
him.</p>
<p>You set alight, like a lamp, your sacred flesh in the midst of Jordan and
sought out the image which had been befouled by sin and the passions; and when
you had found it you made it fait by your Baptism, loving Lord, therefore we
sing your praise.</p>

<p>‘The God who descended into the furnace of fire to the Hebrew Youths and
changed the flame to dew, all you his works sing his praise as Lord, and highly
exalt him to all the ages’.</p>
<p>A Voice crying clearly in the wilderness, John came, turning back hearts that
fervently repent to glorify the Saviour and Master as he appears in the Jordan.</p>
<p>Seeking to dry up the streams of the enemy’s wickedness, to repel the seas
of the passions and to pour out pardon and forgiveness for the faithful, Master,
you are coming to be baptized in the streams of Jordan.</p>
<p>Maker of hours and times, through compassion become subject to time, who
shone out timelessly from the Father who is before eternity, you have come to
wash away the time-old faults of all in the streams of Jordan.</p>

<p>‘The Word, God from God, who has come with ineffable wisdom to renew Adam,
terribly fallen by eating to corruption, for us ineffably incarnate from a holy
Virgin, with one accord in hymns we the faithful magnify him’.</p>
<p>When John saw you, O Benefactor, coming to him and in humility asking Baptism
from you, he was amazed and drew back, in no way daring to touch with his hand
the One who touches all the mountains and they smoke.</p>
<p>Like a holy swallow, harbinger of spiritual spring, the Baptist came to those
in the winter of unnumbered faults and ever enduring the tempestuous gale of
hostile spirits with most wicked passions.</p>
<p>Seeing your fruitlessness the axe of death laid to your roots as to tree
threatens to fell you; do not then continue fruitless, my soul, but cry out to
God with fervent repentance, ‘I have sinned, save me’.</p>
<p>The voice of one who cried was heard in desert hearts, ‘Be glad, Christ has
come granting forgiveness to all. Be hallowed every sea, springs and rivers,
valleys and lakes and all that lies beneath the sun.</p>

<p>Go on, Angelic Powers, from Bethlehem to Jordan’s streams. Leaving the
wilderness behind. John draw near. River rejoice and make ready. Let all the
earth be glad. Christ is coming to cleanse the sin of Adam, as he is
compassionate.</p>
<p>With pure mouths and souls made clean, come, let us mystically pass over from
Bethlehem and hastening with Christ to the Jordan let us, all the tribes of the
earth, now sing to him as we say with faith, ‘Blessed is our God who has come;
glory to you’.</p>
<p>Great and fearful is the mystery! That God has been made like humans and
wholly without knowledge of sin the guiltless today asks to be baptized by John
in the river Jordan. Blessed is our God who has appeared; glory to you!</p>
<p>A flower from David, which blossomed from the Virgin, Christ has come to the
streams of Jordan to wash away the sins of the Forefather in the waters. Adam,
dance; Eve rejoice; let heaven be glad; let peoples say, `Blessed is our God who
has come; glory to you’.</p>

<p>Fearing to place his hand, with his hand he trembles; with his soul John
rejoices, understanding that you have been well-pleased to incline your head,

slavery of the foe, as they cry, ‘Blessed is our God who has come; glory to
you’.</p>

the sin of Adam.</p>

<p>The feast of Christ’s Nativity that has passed was more radiant than the
sun; the feast of his divine Epiphany that is coming is resplendent and full of
light. In the former Shepherds, giving glory with Angels, worshipped God become
man, while in this John touched the Master with his right hand and said with
fear, ‘Sanctify me and the waters, O you who alone have great mercy’.</p>

<p>Verse: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">I will remember you from the
land of Jordan and the Hermonites, from the little mountain.</p>
<p>River Jordan prepare, for see Christ God is coming to be baptized by John,
that by his Godhead he may crush the invisible heads of the dragons in your
waters. Wilderness of Jordan rejoice; mountains leap for joy with gladness, for
eternal life has come to call back Adam. Voice of one who cries, Forerunner
John, shout aloud, ‘Prepare the ways of the Lord and make straight his paths’.</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Verse: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The waters saw you, O God,
the waters saw you and were afraid.</p>
<p>Let the wilderness of Jordan rejoice and flower like a lily; for the voice of
one who cries has been heard in it, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord’; for the
One who weighed the mountains with a balance and the valleys with a level, the
One who fills all things as God is being baptized by a slave. The One who
distributes rich gifts of grace has begun to make himself poor. Eve heard, ‘In
pains you will give birth to children’, but now the Virgin has heard, ‘Hail,
full of grace, the Lord is with you who has great mercy’.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</p>
