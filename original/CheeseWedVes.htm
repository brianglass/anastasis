[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">4,12-21</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord: Let all the nations rouse themselves and go up to the
Valley of Iosaphat, because there I will sit to judge the nations round about.
Put out the sickle, for the harvest is here. Come out and tread, for the wine
press is full. The vats are overflowing, for their evils have been multiplied.
Sounds have re-echoed in the valley of judgement, for the day of the Lord is
near in the valley of judgement. Sun and moon will grow dark together, and the
stars will hide their light. But the Lord will cry aloud in Sion and will utter
his voice from Jerusalem, and heaven and earth will be shaken. But the Lord will
spare his people and strengthen the children of Israel. And you will know that I
am the Lord your God, who dwell on Sion my holy mountain, and foreigners will
pass through it no longer. And it will come to pass on that day that the
mountains will drip sweetness and the hills flow with milk, and all the channels
of Juda will flow with waters; and a spring will go out from the Lord’s house
and water the torrent of the reeds. Egypt will be for destruction and Idumea a
plain of destruction, because of the injustices done to the children of Juda,
for they spilled just blood in their land. But Judea will be inhabited for ever
and Jerusalem to generations of generations. And I will seek out their blood and
not spare them. And the Lord will dwell in Sion.</p>
