<p ALIGN="CENTER">Tone 8. O marvellous wonder!</font></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">

<p>O marvellous wonder! In heaven and on earth joy has dawned bright today at the
commemoration of the Martyr Demetrios; from the Angels he is garlanded with praises, and
from humans he receives songs. O how he struggled! How well he competed! Through him the
cunning foe has fallen and Christ has conquered.</p>

<p>O marvellous wonder! By the beams of his wonders Demetrios shines for ever through the
ends of the earth more brightly than the sun, shining from the light that knows no
evening, and taking his pleasure in the light that never sets; by his rays barbarian
clouds have been dispelled, diseases chased away, demons defeated.</p>

<p>O marvellous wonder! Thrice-blessed Demetrios, transfixed by a lance for the sake of
Christ, has appeared each day like a two-edged sword against foes, as he cuts of the
arrogance of enemies and breaks in pieces the insolence of demons. To him let us cry out:
Holy Demetrios, protect us who ever honour your all-revered memory</p>

<p>You appeared as a tower of true religion, firmly established on the rock of the faith,
not captured by temptations and not shaken by dangers; for the waves of the godless
breaking against you with violent swell and tempest did not cast down your unshakeable
firmness; for you longed to be adorned with a martyr&#146;s crown.</p>

<p>Imitating by suffering the suffering of Christ, you have received from him, glorious
Champion Demetrios, the power to work wonders; and you save those who have recourse to
you, delivering them from many dangers, as you have well-pleasing boldness towards Christ;
before whom you now stand, filled with glory.</p>

<p>Dripping with your own blood, Demetrios, you were offered to Christ the Giver of life
who emptied out his precious blood for your sake; and he made you a sharer in his glory, a
companion in his kingship, for you had won the victory against the boaster and completely
quenched his dread devices.</p>

<p>To-day the universal festival of the Champion calls us together. Come then, lovers of
feasts, let us radiantly celebrate his memorial, as we say: Hail, who tore apart the tunic
of impiety through the faith, robing yourself in the courage of the Spirit! Hail, who
destroyed the purposes of the lawless with the strength given you by God! Hail, who when
your limbs were pierced by the lance depicted for us spiritually the blessed passion of
Christ! Implore him, Demetrios, ornament of Athletes, that we may be rescued from visible
and invisible foes, and that our souls may be saved.</p>

selection</font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">]</p>

<p>Look down from heaven, Lord, and see from your holy house and your glory. Where is the
multitude of your mercy and your pity, that you keep back from us, O Lord? For you are our
Father, though Abraham did not know us, though Israel did not acknowledge us; but you are
our Father, deliver us. From the beginning your name is upon us. Why have you made us
wander from your way, Lord? Why have you hardened our hearts not to fear you? Turn back
for the sake of your servants, for the tribes of your inheritance, that we may inherit a
small part of your holy mountain. Our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary. We have
become as at the beginning, when you did not know us, when your name had not been invoked
upon us. If you open the heaven, trembling will take hold upon mountains from you, and
they will melt as wax melts before the fire; and fire will burn up your enemies, and your
name will be manifest to your enemies; before your face nations will be troubled. When you
do glorious things trembling from you will seize mountains. From eternity we have not
heard, nor have we seen a God save you; and your works are true, and you do mercy to those
who wait on you. For mercy will meet those who act justly, and they will be mindful of
your ways. And now, Lord, your are our Father, while we are your clay and you are our
Fashioner; we are all the works of your hands; do not be very angry with us, Lord, and do
not remember our sins in season. And now look upon, Lord, for we are all your people.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the Prophecy of Jeremy.<br>
[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">2:1-12</font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">]</p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: I have remembered the mercy of your youth and the love of your
marriage, in your following the Holy One of Israel, says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.
For the Lord the first of his produce. All that devour him shall offend; evils will come
upon them, says the Lord. Hear the word of the Lord, house of Jacob and all the family of
the house of Israel. Thus says the Lord: What offence did your fathers find in me, that
they rebelled far from me and went after vanities and became vain? Nor did they say: Where
is the Lord, who brought us up from Egypt, who guided us in the wilderness, in a vast and
trackless land, in a waterless and fruitless land, and in the shadow of death? In a land
in which no man had ever journeyed, nor had any human dwelt there? And I led you into
Carmel, to eat its fruits and its good things. And you entered and defiled my land, and
you turned my inheritance into an abomination. Your priests did not say: Where is the
Lord? And those who stood by the law did not know me, and the shepherds sinned against me,
and the prophets prophesied by Baal and went after what is profitless. Therefore I will
dispute with you again, says the Lord, and I will dispute with your children&#146;s
children. Pass through the isles of the Kittim and see; send to Kedar and observe closely,
and see if such things have been done; if the nations will change their gods - and they
are not gods. But my people has changed their glory for that from which they get no
profit. Heaven is amazed at this and shudders greatly with horror, says the Lord.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the Wisdom of Solomon.<br>
[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">3:1-9</font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">]</p>

<p>The souls of the just are in the hand of God, and no torment will ever touch them. In
the eyes of fools they seemed to have died, and their departure was reckoned a disaster,
and their going from us their destruction; but they are in peace. For though in the sight
of mankind they were punished, their hope is full of immortality. And having been
disciplined a little, they will receive great good; because God tried them and found them
worthy of himself. He proved them like gold in a furnace and accepted them as whole burnt
offering. And at the moment of their visitation they will shine out, and they will run
like sparks through stubble. They will judge nations and hold sway over peoples, and the
Lord will be their king to the ages. Those who have trusted in him will understand truth;
and the faithful in love will abide with him; because grace and mercy are upon his holy
ones, and his visitation upon his chosen.</font></p>

<p>He lived in the reign of the Emperors Diocletian and Maximianos and was from the city
of Thessalonika, a devout Christian from the start and a teacher of the faith in Christ.
But when Maximianos visited Thessalonika, the Saint was arrested as being well known for
his beliefs. The Emperor was extremely proud of a certain Lyaios and urged the people of
the place to come out and meet him in combat (Lyaios was a man of huge stature and
excelled in strength those who came agaisnt him). A certain young man, Christian by faith,
named Nestor, went to Demetrios, who was in prison, and said, &#145;Servant of God, I
intend to compete aginst Lyaios. But pray for me.&#146; Demetrios signed his forehead with
the sign of the Cross and said, &#145;You will both beat Lyaios and bear a Mertyr&#146;s
witness for Christ.&#146; At these words Nestor took courage and opposed Lyaios, cast down
his arrogant boasting and slew him.</p>

<p>Because of this the Emperor was humiliated and after investigation having found out
what had happened, he gave orders that first Demetrios should be run through in the side
with lances, as he was the cause of Lyaios&#146; slaughter. This being done the Saint at
once gave up his life and after his death became the cause of many wonders and cures.
Then, at the Emperor&#146;s order, Saint Nestor was beheaded.</p>

<p>In the twenty fourth year of the reign of Leo the Isaurian, in the ninth Indiction, on
the 26th of October, there was a great and terrible earthquake in Constantinople, so that
the upper stories and the more splendid of the other buildings collapsed and many people
were buried under the ruins. And so on the day of the Great martyr Demetrios we
commemorate that terrible threat of the earthquake, going in procession to the church in
Vlachernae of our all-pure, holy and glorious Lady, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary,
where we celebrate the divine Liturgy. At her prayers may we be delivered from every
threat and attain eternal good things, in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory and
might to the ages of ages. Amen.</font></p>
