<p>It came to pass, when Jesus was in Jericho, that he looked up with his eyes and saw a
man standing in front of him, and his drawn sword was in his hand. And Jesus approached
him and said: &#145;Are you one of ours? Or are you one of the enemy&#146;s?&#146; But he
said to him: &#145;I am Chief Captain of the power of the Lord, and now I have come
here&#146;. And Jesus fell on his face to the ground and said: &#145;Master, what orders
have you for your servant?&#146; And the Chief Captain of the Lord said to Jesus:
&#145;Untie the sandals from your feet; for the place where you are standing is
holy&#146;; and Jesus did so.</p>

<p>It came to pass in that day that Madiam prevailed against the children of Israel, and
they cried to God. And behold, the Angel of the Lord came and sat under the oak of Joas in
Ephrata, and Gedeon his son was threshing wheat in the wine-press, and hastening to escape
from the presence of Madiam. And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him:
&#145;The Lord is with you, powerful in strength&#146;. And Gedeon said to him: &#145;In
me, my Lord; and if the Lord is with us, why have all these evils come upon us? And where
are all his wonders, of which our fathers told us, saying: &#145;Did not the Lord lead us
up out of Egypt?&#146; And now he has abandoned us, and handed us over to the hand of
Madiam&#146;. And the Angel of the Lord looked on him and said to him: &#145;Go in this
strength of yours and you will save Israel from the hand of Madiam. See, I have sent
you&#146;. And Gedeon said to him: &#145;In me, Lord. How shall I save Israel? See, my
thousand is the humblest in Manasse, and I am the smallest in my father&#146;s
house&#146;. And the Angel of the Lord said to him: &#145;The Lord will be with you, and
you will smite Madiam as one man&#146;. And Gedeon said to him: &#145;If I have found
grace in your eyes, and you do for me to-day everything of which you have spoken with me,
do not, pray, leave here until I come back to you, and I shall bring my sacrifice and
offer sacrifice before you&#146;. And he said; &#145;I am, I shall sit here until you
return&#146;. And Gedeon went and prepared a goat kid and an measure of unleavened flour,
and he put the meat in a basket and the broth he put in a pot and brought them to him
under the oak, and approached. And the Angel of the Lord said to him: &#145;Take the meat
and the unleavened loaves and put them on that rock and pour out the broth next it&#146;.
And he did so. And the Angel of the Lord stretched out the tip of the rod in his hand and
touched the meat and the unleavened loaves; and fire was kindled from the rock and it
devoured the meat and the unleavened loaves; and the Angel of the Lord disappeared from
his sight. And Gedeon saw that it was the Angel of the Lord, and Gedeon said: &#145;Alas
Lord, Lord! Because I have seen the Angel of the Lord face to face&#146;. And the Lord
said to him: &#145;Peace to you, do not be afraid, you shall not die&#146;. And Gedeon
built there an altar to the Lord, and called it PEACE OF THE LORD until this day.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the Prophecy of Daniel.<br>
[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">10, 1-21</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>In the third year of Cyrus, king of the Persians, a word was revealed to Daniel, whose
name was called Baltasar; and the word was true and mighty power, and understanding was
given him in a vision. In those days, I Daniel had been mourning for three weeks of days.
And desiring bread, I did not eat, and meat and wine did not enter my mouth, I did not
anoint myself with oil until the completion of the three weeks of days. And on the twenty
fourth of the first month in the third year, I was near the great river, that is the
Tigris. And I raised my eyes and looked, and behold a man, clothed in linen, his loins
girt with gold of Ophaz; and his body was as Tharsis, and his face like the sight of
lightning, and his eyes like lamps of fire, and his arms and legs like the sight of
gleaming bronze, and the sound of his words was as the sound of a multitude. And I Daniel
alone saw the vision, and the men who were with me saw nothing; but great amazement fell
on them and they fled in fear. And I was left alone, and I saw this great vision, and no
strength was left in me, and my glory was turned to corruption, and I retained no
strength. And I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of his words I
was stunned with my face to the ground. And behold a hand was touching me and raised me
onto my knees and the knuckles of my hands. And he said to me; &#145;Daniel, man of
desires, understand by the words which I speak to you, and stand upright, because I have
been sent to you&#146;; and when he had spoken this word to me I arose trembling. And he
said to me: &#145;Daniel, do not be afraid, because from the first day that you gave your
heart to understand and to be afflicted before the Lord your God, your words were heard,
and I have come through your words. And the Ruler of the kingdom of the Persians resisted
me for twenty one days; and behold Michael one of the chief Rulers came to help me, and I
left him there with the Ruler of the kingdom of the Persians. And I have come to make you
understand all that will happen to your people in the last days; because the vision is yet
for days ahead&#146;. And when he spoke to me in these words, I put my face to the ground
and was stunned. And behold as the likeness of a son of man touched my lips; and I opened
my mouth, and spoke and said to the one who stood in front of me: &#145;Lord, at the sight
of you, my inward parts were turned within me, and I had no strength. And how will your
servant, Lord, be able to speak with my Lord? And from now on strength will not remain in
me, and breath has not been left in me&#146;. And once again there touched me as it were
the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me and said to me: &#145;Do not be afraid,
man of desires, peace be with you; be a man and be strong&#146;. And when he had spoken
with me I grew strong and said: &#145;Let my Lord speak to me, for you have given me
strength&#146;. And he said: &#145;Do you know why I have come to you? And now I shall
return to make war on the Ruler of the Persians; and as I was going in the Ruler of the
Greeks came. But I shall tell you what is ordained in the scripture of truth, and there is
not one that upholds me against these, but Michael your Ruler&#146;.</font></p>

Could one the offspring of nine months pronounce?</p>

<p>Michael the pre-eminent Captain of the bodiless Powers, in both the Old Testament and
the New Grace, has shown and shows to the human race his many graces and benefactions. For
when the opponent and enemy of our salvation tossing his mane against the Creator, said
swaggeringly: &#145;I shall place my throne above the clouds&#146; and boastingly: &#145;I
shall be like the Most High&#146;, he fell, as the Lord says, from his Archangel&#146;s
dignity. For he says: &#145;I saw Satan falling from heaven like lightning.&#146; Moreover
the bragging Order under him suffered the same fate. But all-honoured Michael,
maintaining, as a faithful servant, his respect for the Master and showing his great care
for our race was appointed by the Almighty to lead the spiritual and archangelic ranks.
For when he saw the rebel fall, he assembled the choirs of Angels and saying: &#145;Let us
attend&#146; hymned aloud the Lord of all things, as though saying: &#145;Let us, who are
creatures, attend to what they have suffered who until now were with us, beings of light,
but now have become darkness. This support then has been named the Assembly of the Angels,
that is attention, agreement and unity.</p>

<p>This great champion then and benefactor of our salvation, abounding in and unfolding
many saving acts of kindness, appears visibly to many. For he was seen by Abraham and Lot
at the overthrow of Sodom. He appeared to Jacob as he fled from his brother. He marched at
the head of the army of the children of Israel when they were being delivered and freed
from the malice of the Egyptians. He appeared to Balaam as he went to curse Israel. To
Jesus son of Navi when he inquired he said: &#145;I the Chief Captain of the Lord have now
come to you.&#146; He also diverted the rivers that had been released against the shrine
and chapel by the impious. And many other stories are told of him in the inspired
Scripture. Therefore we also, putting him forward as protector and guardian of our life,
celebrate his present all-honoured festival, asking through his prayers and intercessions
that we may find deliverance from troubles in this present age, and in the age to come
that we may be found worthy of heaven&#146;s grace and rank. Amen.</p>

<p>At the prayers of your Saints, O God, have mercy on us. Amen.</font></p>
