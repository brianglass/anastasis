<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5" color="#FF0000">Canon by Theophanes<br>
</font><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">of which the acrostic is:</font><br>
<font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">With love I sing Mary Magdalen.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Ode 1. Tone 8. On
crossing the water.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">With divine loveliness renowned, and resplendent
with light that streams from God, shed radiance, Mary, by your prayers onto my blackened
heart.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Word of the Father rescued you from the
wickedness of spirits and made you holy. You became his disciple and have been filled with
the gifts of grace of the all-holy Spirit.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Filled with life-giving streams from a plentiful
Fount - the Master who through pity appeared on earth -, you dried up the muddy waters of
sin.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Theotokion</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">We sing your praise, O Maiden, as Mother of him who
is by nature the Creator, for you reconciled to God human nature that had offended, O
Mother of God, all-blameless Lady.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Ode 3. You
constructed. </font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Mary, you loved the first cause of blessings, who in
compassion made our nature divine, and you followed him fervently, obedient to his divine
commands.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Joyfully you came to the tomb of the Redeemer, being
the first, O Maiden, to look on the divine Resurrection. Therefore you were declared
herald of the Gospel and cried out: Christ has been raised. Clap your hands.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The Word, O all-pure, who was incarnate from your
all-pure blood, saves me, with a wealth of goodness abolishing the sentence of the ancient
condemnation. Entreat him without ceasing to save your flock.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Irmos.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You constructed the heavens&#146; high vault, O
Lord, and the Church, * has you as its builder, do you establish me in your love. * You
are the pinnacle * of all desires, and foundation, * mankind&#146;s only Lover, of all who
believe in you.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Ode 4. I have heard,
Lord.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">With a mind undisturbed by the vanity of the world,
you served the one who had come to save the whole world from error.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">As you washed the tomb of Life with tears, Mary, you
met an Angel and saw him proclaim Christ&#146;s Resurrection.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Your heart was blameless in Christ&#146;s statutes,
and you longed for him alone, the one fair in beauty, O worthy of praise.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">By the slumber of indifference the sleep of sin
overcame me, O Maiden. By your unsleeping intercession rouse me to repentance.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Ode 5. Why have you
rejected me.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The foremother, seeing the one who tricked her by
words and exiled her from Paradise of old trampled on by holy women who had gained a will
of courage, rejoices with them eternally.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Wounded with longing for his sweet love, you bring
sweet spices to the one who breathes life into all, now slain and lying in a tomb, holy
Mary Magdalen, and pour out the fragrant scent of tears.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">After the divine Passion, after the dread
Resurrection of the Saviour you hurried to and fro, proclaiming the holy word, and as a
Disciple of the Word catching many who had been deceived by ignorance, glorious Saint.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">The one who through his measureless mercy was well
pleased to be born from you, all-holy Maiden, sets upright me, who have fallen into the
tangled gulfs of sin. Implore him that those who with faith sing your praise may be
rescued from every harm.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Ode 6. Have mercy on
me, O Saviour.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">With the dew of your words, honoured Saint, you
dispelled the fierce heat of the despair of the Disciples as you cried out: Christ has
been raised; Life has appeared; the radiant Sun has blazed forth.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">See, Mary, worthy of praise, your feast filled with
light has shone out, giving light to all who on it faithfully sing your praise, and
chasing away the darkness of the abuse of evil demons.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You have appeared, O all-blameless, as a spiritual
sanctuary and mercy seat that may not be touched, lampstand formed of light and bridge
leading over to God those who sing your praise as Mother of God.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Ode 7. The Hebrew
Youths.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You drove out diseases of many kinds, having gained
the Word as your fellow-worker, before whom you now stand, O Myrrhbearer, crying out:
Blessed are you, Lord God, to the ages.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Alone before the rest you saw our life, Christ who
had been raised; but you took him for the gardener, crying out: Blessed are you, Lord God,
to the ages.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You halted the onrush of death as you conceived and
gave birth to immortal God, pure Virgin. To you we all sing: Blessed, all-pure, is the
fruit of your womb.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Ode 8. The Chaldean
tyrant.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Your way of life, O Magdalen, was resplendent
blazing with the beams of virtuous actions, of the divine proclamation and your
inclination to the divine, and with the bright rays of love for the Creator, to whom you
sing with the Angels: You priests, bless; you people, highly exalt to all the ages.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You stood by the Cross, glorious Mary, watching the
unjust slaughter of the one who emptied himself through ineffable mercy; and drenched with
groans and tears, you cried out: What is this strange wonder? How is he, who slew death
and who is life by nature, slain and dying?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">With one mind we glorify you as Mother of God and
higher than all creatures, O all-pure. For in you the condemnation that came from Adam has
been annulled, and rejected human nature has been reconciled and sings: You priests,
bless; you people, highly exalt to all the ages.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Ode 9. Heaven was
amazed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You have now been translated to divine joy, to the
broad plain of Paradise, to spiritual dwellings beyond the world, where the ranks of Holy
Ones are found and the pure sound of those who feast in splendour, O Myrrhbearer Mary. And
so we all call you blessed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You preferred none of the things on earth to the
love of Christ God, but wounded by his beauties only and by the bright beams at once sent
forth, following in his footsteps, O all-honoured, you cried out: I magnify you, O most
merciful.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">You have found deification that makes divine, you
enjoy the torrent of grace, receive the rewards for your toils from God, are numbered with
the ranks of the Apostles, Magdalen, Disciple of the Word. By your prayers guard those who
honour you with love.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FF0000" size="4">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">As Mother of the one who suffered the Passion for
our sake, save me from soul-destroying passions; as you are compassionate, loose the bonds
of my faults; as you are good, do good to my soul, now wearied by the abuse of demons,
Virgin Mother of God, that I may sing your praise as all-blameless.</font></p>
