ministered to God, mediating between the Fashioner and his fashioning, blessed Saint, and
receiving clear revelations of the divine Spirit. And so we call you blessed, and, as we
celebrate your holy festival today, we glorify the Saviour.</p>

<p>Zachary, inspired by God, you saw a Child, like his Father without beginning, born from
the Maiden, and you spoke prophetically to your child, &#145;You will be truly a Prophet,
preparing his paths&#146;. With him we call you blessed, and we observe your revered
festival, most blessed God-bearer.</p>

<p>You became a living and breathing temple of the divine Spirit, and as with a pure heart
you conversed with God in the midst of the temple, glorious Saint, you were unjustly
slaughtered, finishing your godly course as a martyr, O worthy of praise. And so you
ascended to the heavenly temple, with your own blood beseeching pardon for those who
honour you.</p>
