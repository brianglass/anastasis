<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" face="Book Antiqua" size="5">INTRODUCTION</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">There is some confusion as to when the post-paschal
instructions were given. The Greek text of the <i>Small Catecheses</i> by Skrettas, based
on Auvray&#146;s edition, gives no indication of dates for numbers 1-6; the list in the
introduction to the Migne edition gives this one as <i>In Dominica Sancti Thomae, sive
prima post Pascha</i>, but the Latin heading of the sermon itself has simply<i> Post
Pascha</i>, and for number 5 <i>In Octavam Paschae</i>, though the Greek list gives this
as for the Wednesday of Mid-Pentecost.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">It should be remembered that St Theodore and his
monks were in exile in the Propontis at this time. This perhaps explains a number of
allusions to shipping and metaphors taken from it in these Instructions. He appears to
have some difficulty in keeping the community together. He refers to the problem again in
no. 103, where he says he has to keeping mentioning it.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="6" face="Book Antiqua">CATECHESIS 2</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><i>That we must always die the chosen
death, and on good order.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Brethren and Fathers, Pascha is gone by and the
feast has been completed; but rejoicing and feasting, should we wish, have by no means
gone by, for we are always allowed to rejoice and feast spiritually, in accordance with
the saying of Scripture, <i>Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I will say: Rejoice!</font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua"> </i>[Phil. 4:4.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">
But how shall this be? If we always keep fresh the memory of the sufferings of our Saviour
Christ; that the Lord of glory was crucified for our sake, that he was buried and that he
was raised on the third day, raising us with himself and giving us life with himself, <i>so
that being alive we may no longer live for ourselves, but for him who died and was raised
for our sake</i>, </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[2 Cor. 5:15.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> so that we can confidently say with the Apostle, <i>I live,
but no longer I; Christ lives in me</i>. <i>What I now live in the flesh, I live in the
faith of the Son of God who loved me and who handed himself over for me.</i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[ Gal. 2:20.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> This
is the sum of the mystery: to be corpses to the world but alive to God.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">And so after Pascha we must be watchful and awake,
pray and be stirred to compunction, weep and be illumined, always <i>bearing in our bodies
the death of the Lord Jesus</i>, </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[2 Cor. 4:10.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> dying each day by choice, always journeying from the body
and dwelling with the Lord through leaving the thoughts of the flesh. Do not say, &#145;It
is not Lent now &#145;. It is always Lent for the watchful. Do not say, &#145;I have spent
hours in ascetic activity and it is necessary to rest&#146;. There is no rest here. Do not
say, &#145;I have grown old in virtue and I am not afraid&#146;. There is always fear of
reversal; and Satan in one instant has cast into the deep of sin many who had grown old in
virtue. <i>So let the one who thinks they stand beware lest they fall</i>, </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[1 Cor. 10:12.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> and
the one who thinks they have been guarded see to it that they are not off their guard. So
let there be guard and attention and moderation with regard to sleep, to food, to drink
and to whatever else, so that the body may be kept under control and brought into
servitude, </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[Cf. 1 Cor. 9:27.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> lest, like a colt in fine condition which takes the bit
between its teeth </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[St Theodore is thinking of
the myth of the Charioteer in the Phaedrus, where this precise phrase occurs [254D]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">, it push us down the precipice of sin.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">I ordered you in a previous instruction not to go
off on your own and live by yourselves in more inaccessible places </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[St Theodore refers to this problem again in number 103, where he says
he has to keep referring to it.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">. Yet again some
of you are doing just that. What do you want? <i>That I should come to you with a rod, or
with love and a spirit of gentleness?</i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[ 1
Cor. 4:21.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> In short, I spoke and I was not
listened to; in short, you clearly saw your brother disciplined for this very thing and
you were not restrained. Take care that none of you falls into a similar sort of
disobedience. These instructions are not given to no purpose or vainly. <i>Because God is
not a God of disorder but of peace, as in all the churches of the Saints.</i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[ 1 Cor. 14:33.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">
And so <i>let everything be done fittingly and in order</i>, </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[1 Cor. 14:40.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> so that in
all things the Lord may be glorified in you. Those of you, brethren, who come alongside </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[The metaphor is of a ship coming to harbour.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> here and there take care for yourselves where and how you
settle and dwell. Do not be like dissolute people, but like ones bound by the spirit; not
like ones without supervision, but like ones under the supervision of the Lord, who
oversees your every movement and action; not ones being driven randomly here and there,
but remaining in stillness in your cells, attending to your manual work, your prayers and
psalmody; not amassing treasure for yourselves from love of money, but content with what
you have now. For he himself said, <i>I will not abandon you</i>, <i>I will not desert
you, so that we may say confidently, The Lord is my helper, and I shall not fear what man
will do to me. Remember your brethren, and keeping before you the outcome of their lives
imitate their faith.</i></font> <font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[Hebrews 13:5-7. St
Theodore has freely adapted verse 7, which in the original refers to &#145;leaders&#146;
rather than &#145;brothers&#146;.]</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Such was the blessed Dometianos, whom we have
praised and whose memorial is with the Saints. How great the business he achieved, how
great the life he accomplished by few toils and struggles, inheriting eternal glory, a man
of no worth in human terms, but since he chose virtue and loved God, God exalted him, in
accordance with what is written, <i>Because I will glorify those who glorify me, and the
one who despises me will be dishonoured </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[1
Kingd. 2:30.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">. It is right to rejoice and be
glad in such brothers; but it is of no use unless we also make our own contribution. If we
contribute as best we can, we too will have a portion with the Saints in Christ Jesus our
Lord, to whom be the glory and the might with the Father and the holy Spirit now and for
ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font>&nbsp; &nbsp;
