<p>After the Dismissal of Small Vespers, the Precious Cross is brought from the
sacristy and placed with its case on the Holy Table. A candle is lit and left
burning in front of it all night.</p>
<p>After the Opening Psalm, we read </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Blessed

Oktoichos, and the following four Prosomia from the Triodion:</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Tone 5. Hail of ascetics</p>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
<p>Shine, Cross of the Lord, with the bright darting rays of your grace on the
hearts of those who honour you, and with love inspired by God, embrace you, O
desire of all the world. Through you our tears of sorrow have been wiped away;
we have been delivered from the snares of death and have passed over to unending
joy. Show us the splendour of your beauty, granting to us your servants the
reward of our abstinence, for we entreat with faith your rich protection and
great mercy.</p>
<p>Hail, life-giving Cross! the fair Paradise of the Church, Tree of
incorruption that blossoms for us with the enjoyment of eternal glory. Through
you the hosts of demons are driven back, the companies of the Angels rejoice
with one accord and the congregations of the faithful keep the feast. You are an
invincible weapon, an unbroken stronghold; you are the victory of kings and the
glory of priests. Grant us also now to draw near to the Passion of Christ and to
His Resurrection.</p>
<p>Hail, life-giving Cross! unconquerable trophy of the true faith, door to
Paradise, succour of the faithful, rampart set about the Church. Through you the
curse has utterly destroyed, the power of death swallowed up, and we are raised
from earth to heaven: invincible weapon, adversary of demons, glory of martyrs,
true ornament of holy monks, haven of salvation bestowing on the world great
mercy.</p>
<p>Come, first-fashioned pair, who fell from the choir on high through the envy
of the murderer of humankind, through the bitter pleasure of tasting from the
tree. See, the Tree, revered by all, draws near! Run with haste and embrace it
joyfully, and cry to it with faith: O all-honoured Cross, you are our succour;
partaking of your fruits we have gained incorruption; we are restored once more
to Eden, and we have received great mercy.</p>

<p>O Christ our God, of your own will you accepted Crucifixion, for the common
restoration of humankind. Taking the reed pen of the Cross, out of love for
humankind, in the red ink of royalty with bloody fingers you signed our
absolution. Do not forsake us, who are in danger once again of being parted from
you. Take pity on your people in distress, for you alone are longsuffering. Rise
up and fight against our enemies, as you are all- powerful.</p>

<p>Lord, who helped gentle David in the combat and enabled him to overcome the
foreigner, come to the aid of our faithful Sovereign and by the weapon of the
Cross cast down our enemies. In your compassion show us your mercy as of old,
and make them know in truth that you are God, and putting our trust in you may
we conquer. At the constant intercessions of your most pure Mother, grant us
your great mercy.</p>

<p>When Gabriel addressed you, O Virgin, with his ‘Hail’, as he spoke the
Master of all things became incarnate in you the holy Ark, as righteous David
sang. You were proclaimed wider than the heavens, for you carried your Creator.
Glory to him who dwelt in you, glory to him who came forth from you, glory to
him who has set us free through your bearing child.</p>
