<p>Psalm 103<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Bless the Lord, my soul! O Lord my God, you have
been greatly magnified. You have clothed yourself with thanksgiving and majesty, wrapping
yourself in light as in a cloak, stretching out the heavens like a curtain, roofing his
upper chambers with waters, placing clouds as his mount, walking on the wings of the wind,
making spirits his Angels and a flame of fire his Ministers, establishing the earth on its
sure base; it will not be moved to age on age. The deep, like a cloak, is its mantle;
waters will stand upon the mountains. At your rebuke they will flee; they will quail at
the voice of your thunder. The mountains rise and the plains descend to the place which
you established for them. You fixed a limit that they will not pass, nor will they return
to cover the earth. You send out springs into the valleys; waters will run between the
mountains. They will give drink to all the beasts of the field; the wild asses will await
them to quench their thirst. Beside them the birds of the air will make their dwelling:
and sing among the rocks. He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth will
be filled from the fruit of your works. He makes grass spring up for the cattle, and green
herb for the service of mankind; to bring food out of the earth, and wine makes glad the
human heart; to make the face cheerful with oil, and bread strengthens the human heart.
The trees of the plain will be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that you planted. There
the sparrows will build their nests; the heron&#146;s dwelling is at their head. The high
mountains are for the deer; rocks a refuge for hares. He made the moon to mark the
seasons; the sun knew the hour of its setting. You appointed darkness, and it was night,
in which all the beasts of the forest will prowl; young lions roaring to plunder and to
seek their food from God. The sun rose and they were gathered together and they will lie
down in their dens. Man will go out to his labour; and to his labouring until evening. How
your works have been magnified, O Lord. With wisdom you have made them all, and the earth
has been filled with your creation. Also this great, wide sea; there there are creeping
things without number, living creatures small and great. There ships go to and fro; this
dragon which you fashioned to sport in it. All things look to you to give them their food
in due season. When you give it them, they will gather it. When you open your hand all
things will be filled with goodness. But when you turn away your face they will be
troubled. You will take away their spirit, and they will perish and return to their dust.
You will send forth your spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of
the earth. May the glory of the Lord endure to the ages. The Lord will rejoice at his
works. He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble. He touches the mountains, and they
smoke. I will sing to the Lord while I live; I will praise my God while I exist. May my
words be pleasing to him. While as for me, I shall rejoice in the Lord. O that sinners
might perish from the earth, and the wicked, so that they are no more. Bless the Lord, my
soul!</font></p>

devised betrayal against the Saviour. O insatiable intent, and inhuman daring! He sold the

<p>The Lord said to Moses: Go down, solemnly charge the people and purify them to-day and
tomorrow, and let them wash their garments; and let them stand ready on the third day; for
on the third day the Lord will come down onto mount Sinai before all the people. And you
shall separate the round about, saying: Watch yourselves not to ascend the mountain and to
touch any of it; anyone who touches the mountain will die the death. A hand shall not
touch it; for with stones he shall be stoned, or with a arrow he shall shot down; whether
beast or human, he shall not live. But when the sounds and the trumpets and the cloud
depart from the mountain, they shall ascend the mountain. Moses came down from the
mountain to the people and hallowed them, and they washed their garments. And he said to
the people: Get ready for three days, do not approach a woman. It came to pass on the
third day, when it was towards dawn, and there were sounds and lightnings and a dark cloud
on mount Sinai, the sound of the trumpet echoed loudly; and all the people in the camp
trembled. And Moses led the people to the meeting with God outside the camp, and they took
their stand beneath the mountain. The whole of mount Sinai smoked because God had come
down upon it in fire, and the smoke went up like the steam from a furnace; and all the
people was greatly amazed; and the sounds of the trumpet increased, growing louder and
louder. Moses spoke, while God answered him with a sound.</font></p>

drew out a line upon it? On what are its rings fixed? Who is the one who placed a
cornerstone upon it? When the stars came into being, all my angels praised me with a loud
voice; I fenced the sea with gates, when it was being delivered, coming out of its
mother&#146;s womb; I placed a cloud for it as clothing, I swaddled it in mist; I placed
limits for it, placing bars and gates round it. I said to it: As far as this you shall go,
and you shall not go further, but your waves shall break in yourself. Or did I order the
morning light in your time? the morning star to see its place, to lay hold on the wings of
the earth, to shake off the ungodly from it? Or have you taken earth &lt;and&gt; clay and
fashioned a living and speaking being, have you placed him on the earth? Have you taken
light from the ungodly, and smashed the arm of the proud? Have you come to the source of
the sea, trodden in the steps of the abyss? Do the gates of death open to you in fear,
when they saw you did Hell&#146;s gate-keepers tremble? Have you been instructed in the
breadth of it &lt;the earth&gt; beneath heaven? Tell me, how great is it? In what land
does the light pitch camp? What is the place of darkness? If you could bring me to its
bounds, if you knew its paths, would you know it because you had been born then, because
the number of your years is great? Job answered the Lord and said: [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">42:1</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]
I know that you can do all things, while nothing is impossible for you. For who is he that
hides counsel from you? Being sparing of words and thinks to hide them from you? Who will
declare to me what I did not know, great and wonderful things what I did not understand?
Hear me, Lord, and I shall speak; I shall ask you, but do you teach me; I have heard of
your report by ear before, but now my eye has seen you.</font></p>

<p>The Lord gives me a tongue of instruction to know when it is right to say a word; he
has set me early, early, he has given me a ear for hearing; and the instruction of the
Lord, the Lord, opens my ears, while I neither disobey nor gainsay. I gave my back to the
scourges, my cheeks to blows, my face I did not turn away from the shame of spittings; and
the Lord, the Lord became my helper, therefore I was not turned back, but set my face as a
firm rock and I knew that I would in no way be shamed, because he who justifies me is
near. Who the one who contends with me? Let him stand up with me together. Who is the one
who contends with me? Let him come near me. See, the Lord, the Lord, will help me; who
will do me wrong? See, you will all grow old as a garment, and as a moth he devours you.
Who among you fears the Lord? Let him obey the voice of his servant. You who walk in
darkness and in whom there is no light, trust in the name of the Lord and rely upon God.
See, all of you, kindle a fire and make a flame strong; walk in the light of your fire,
and in the flame which you have set burning; through me all these things have befallen
you; in grief you will sleep.</font></p>

<p>Brethren, I have received from the Lord what I have also handed on to you, that the
Lord Jesus in the night he was handed over took bread and having given thanks broke it and
said: Take, eat; this is my body broken for you; do this in memory of me. Likewise the cup
also after supper, saying: This cup is the new testament in my blood; do this, as often as
you drink it, in memory of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you
proclaim the Lord&#146;s death, until he comes. So that whoever eats this bread or drinks
the cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the Lord&#146;s body and blood. Let
each one then test himself, and so let him eat of this bread and drink of the cup; for one
who eats and drinks unworthily eats and drinks judgement to himself, not discerning the
Lord&#146;s body. Because of this many among you are weak and sick and some have fallen
asleep. But if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged. But when we re judged, we
are being disciplined by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</font></p>

<p>The Lord said to his disciples, &#145;You know that it is Passover in two days, and the
Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.&#146; Then the chief priests and scribes
and elders of the people assembled at the court of the chief priest, who was called
Caiaphas, and took counsel together to seize Jesus by trickery and kill him. But they
said, &#145;Not during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people.&#146; Now when
Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, a woman approached him with an
alabaster jar of very precious ointment and she poured it on his head as he sat at table.
When his disciples saw they were indignant and said, &#145;Why this waste? For this
ointment could have been sold for a great deal and given to the poor.&#146; But Jesus,
knowing, said to them, &#145;Why are you making trouble for the woman? She has performed a
good deed for me. For you always have the poor with you; you do not always have me. By
pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it for my burial. Amen I say to you,
wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world what she has done will be told also
in memory of her.&#146; Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief
priests and said, &#145;What are willing to give me if I betray him to you?&#146; They
settled with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from then on he was looking for an
opportunity to betray him. On the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to
Jesus and said to him, &#145;Where do you wish us to make ready for you to eat the
Passover?&#146; He said, &#145;Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, &#145;The
teacher says, &#145;My time is near. At your house I must celebrate the Passover with my
disciples.&#146;&#146;&#146; And the disciples did as Jesus had ordered them and they made
ready the Passover. When evening came he sat down with the twelve. Jesus, knowing that the
Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come forth from God and was
going back to God, rises from supper and lays aside his outer garments; and taking a towel
he ties it round his waist. Then he puts water in the basin and began to wash the
disciples&#146; feet and wipe them with the towel which was tied round his waist. He comes
to Simon Peter, who says to him, &#145;Lord, are you going to wash my feet?&#146; Jesus
answered and said to him, &#145;What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will
understand later.&#146; Peter says to him, &#145;You shall never wash my feet.&#146; Jesus
answered him, &#145;Unless I wash you, you have no part in me.&#146; Peter says to him,
&#145;Lord, not only my feet, but my hands and my head also.&#146; Jesus says to him,
&#145;One who has washed has no need except to wash their feet, but they are wholly clean.
And you are clean, but not all of you.&#146; For he knew the one who would betray him;
that is why he said, &#145;You are not all clean.&#146; So when he had washed their feet
he put on his outer garments, sat down again and said to them, &#145;Do you know what I
have done to you? You call me &#145;Teacher&#146; and &#145;Lord&#146;, and you do well,
for I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you too should wash one
another&#146;s feet. For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, you
should do also. Amen, amen, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his lord, nor one
who is sent greater than the one who sent him. If you know all this, blessed are you, if
you do it.&#146; And as they were eating he said, &#145;Amen I say to you, one of you is
going to betray me.&#146; Deeply distressed they began to ask him one by one, &#145;Surely
not me, Lord?&#146; He answered and said, &#145;The one who dips his hand with me in the
dish is the one who is going to betray me. The Son of Man is going as is written of him;
but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would have been better for
that man not to have been born.&#146; Judas his betrayer said, &#145;Surely not me,
Rabbi?&#146; He said to him, &#145;You have said so.&#146; While they were eating Jesus
took bread and having blessed and broken it gave it to his disciples and said, &#145;Take,
eat; this is my body.&#146; He took the cup and having given thanks gave it to them
saying, &#145;Drink from this all of you; for this is my blood of the new testament which
is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins. But I tell you that from now on I shall not
drink from this fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it with you new in the
kingdom of my father. And when they had sung a hymn they went out to the mount of olives.
Then Jesus said to them, &#145;You will all stumble and fall away from me this night. For
it is written, &#145;I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be
scattered.&#146; But after I have been raised I shall go before you into Galilee.&#146;
Peter answered and said, &#145;Even if all stumble and fall from you, I will never
stumble.&#146; Jesus said to him, &#145;Amen I say to you, this very night before a cock
crows you will deny me three times.&#146; Peter says to him, &#145;Even if I have to die
with you, I will never deny you.&#146; And all the disciples said the same. Then Jesus
went with them to a place called Gethsemane and said to the disciples, &#145;Sit here
while I go over there and pray.&#146; And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee he
began to grow sorrowful and distressed. Then Jesus said to them, &#145;My soul is very
sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me.&#146; And going forward a little
way he fell on his face and prayed, saying, &#145;My father, if it is possible let this
cup pass me by. But not as I wish, but as you do.&#146; An angel appeared to him from
heaven to strengthen him. And being in agony he prayed more fervently; while his sweat
became like drops of blood falling to the ground. And rising from prayer he came to his
disciples and found them asleep, and he said to Peter, &#145;So, were you unable to watch
with me for one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter the time of trial. The spirit
is willing, but the flesh is weak.&#146; Then he went away a second time and prayed,
saying, &#145;If this cup cannot pass me by unless I drink it, your will be done.&#146;
And he came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy. And leaving them he
went away again and prayed a third time, saying the same words. Then he comes to his
disciples and says to them, &#145;Sleep now, and rest! See, the moment has come and the
Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise up, let us be going. See, the
one who betrays me has come.&#146; While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve,
came, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and elders
of the people. The one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, &#145;The one
I kiss is the man; seize hold of him.&#146; And he came straight up to Jesus and said,
&#145;Hail, Rabbi,&#146; and he kissed him. Jesus said to him, &#145;Friend, for what
purpose are you here?&#146; Then they came forward, took hold of Jesus and seized him. And
one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword and struck the high
priest&#146;s slave and cut off his ear. Then Jesus said to him, &#145;Put your sword back
in its place. For all who take the sword will die by the sword. Or do you imagine that I
cannot ask my Father, and he will furnish me here and now with more than twelve legions of
angels? But then how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must happen like
this?&#146; At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, &#145;You have come out to arrest me
with swords and clubs, like a thief. Day by day I used to sit with you in the temple, and
you did not seize me. But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets may
be fulfilled.&#146; Then all his disciples abandoned him and fled. But those who had
seized him led him away to Caiaphas the chief priest, where the scribes and elders had
assembled. While Peter was following him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high
priest, and he went in and sat with the servants to see the end. The chief priests and the
elders and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus, so that they
might put him to death, but they found none. Though many false witnesses came forward,
they found none. Finally two false witnesses came forward and said, &#145;This man said,
&#145;I am able to destroy God&#146;s temple and rebuild it in three days.&#146;&#146; The
chief priest arose and said to him, &#145;Have you no answer? What are these men
testifying against you?&#146; But Jesus was silent. The chief priest answered and said to
him, &#145;I put you under oath before the living God to tell us if you are the Christ,
the son of God?&#146; Jesus says to him, &#145;It is you who have said it. But I tell you
all, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and
coming on the clouds of heaven.&#146; Then the chief priest rent his garments and said,
&#145;He has blasphemed. What further need do we have of witnesses? See, you have now
heard his blasphemy. What is your verdict?&#146; They answered and said, &#145;He deserves
death.&#146; Then they spat in his face and hit him, while others slapped him as they
said, &#145;Prophesy, Christ: who it is that struck you?&#146; But Peter was sitting
outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, &#145;You were with
Jesus the Galilean too.&#146; But he denied it in front of them all and said, &#145;I do
not know what you are talking about.&#146; As he was going out into the gatehouse another
servant girl saw him and said to the people there, &#145;This one too was with Jesus the
Nazorean.&#146; And again he denied it with an oath, &#145;I do not know the man.&#146;
Shortly after the bystanders came up and said to Peter, &#145;Truly you are one of them.
For even your speech gives you away.&#146; Then he began to call down curses and to swear,
&#145;I do not know the man.&#146; And immediately a cock crowed. And Peter remembered the
word that Jesus had said to him, &#145;Before a cock crows, you will deny me three
times.&#146; And he went out and wept bitterly. Now when morning came all the chief
priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, so as to put him to
death. They bound him and led him away and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the
governor.</font></p>
