<p>O God, you are glorious in your wonders; you do marvels; you turned the deep into dry
land, covered chariots and saved a people who sing to you, as God our redeemer.</font></p>

<p>O only King, who perform signs and do marvels, as merciful you willingly underwent the
Cross; having put death to death by death, you gave us life.</p>

<p>At Christ&#146;s Rising let us dance with faith today, O peoples: Hell has been
despoiled; rapidly he gave up the prisoners he held, as they praised the wonderful works
of God.</p>

<p>Christ, who with divine power once braced the limbs of the paralytic by your word, and
ordered him who had been weak for many years to take up his bed, heal my fearsomely sick
soul.</p>

<p>Once the Angel would come down into the Sheep Pool and cure one person each year; but
now by divine Baptism Christ cleanses unnumbered multitudes.</p>

<p>Prince of Angels, Chief Captain of the ministers on high, protect, and guard those who
have come together in your venerable temple and who sing God&#146;s praises.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory.</p>

<p>With the Bodiless ones let us ceaselessly sing the praise of God without beginning in
three persons but one nature, Father, Word, Spirit, with kingship and might undivided.</p>

<p>The sun of old seeing you hanging upon the tree, O Word, withdrew its light, the whole
earth was shaken; when you died the dead arose, O all-powerful.</p>

<p>When you came with your soul to the belly of the earth, Hell speedily gave up the souls
he had acquired, which loudly sang a song of thanks to your might, O only Lord.</p>

<p>O supremely Good, heal my soul which for many many years has been grievously sick; that
I may tread the paths which you have marked out for those who love you.</p>

<p>With the ranks on high make intercession for those who sing your praise with faith,
Archangel of God, guarding and protecting us who fall into the snares of life&#146;s
passions.</p>

<p>Consumed by envy the Hebrew people crucified you on a tree, O Lord; and having annulled
the sentence of death, you rose from the dead as mighty, raising the world with you.</p>

<p>&#145;Why, O women, do you seek the inexhaustible Sweetness with sweet spices? He has
risen&#146;, said the one who was seated clothed in white to the Myrrhbearers, &#145;and
fills the whole world with fragrance&#146;.</p>

<p>Bearing the image of a servant in your surpassing compassion, O Word, you passed by on
your way and restored health to the man who had lain sick for many years, and ordered him
to take up his bed.</p>

<p>An Angel of the Lord went down at from time to time and stirred up the water in the
Sheep Pool, making one, and only one person well; but Christ saves countless multitudes by
divine Baptism.</p>

<p>Prince of the Angels, guide of the erring, God&#146;s Chief Captain, be among us at
this hour, and offer all our prayers to the only Maker and Master.</p>

<p>Christ has risen as he said, having emptied the palaces of Hell, and he appears to the
Apostles, giving them a share in the joy that lasts forever.</p>

<p>A snow-white, dazzling Angel appeared to the women saying, &#145;Do not weep. Our Life

<p>Willingly you were raised on a tree, you were placed as a dead man in a tomb, and
having given life to all the dead in Hell together, you rose, O Christ, by divine power.</p>

<p>Hell meeting you below was embittered, Merciful one, and hastily gave back his
prisoners, as they hymned your dread Resurrection, Saviour, with never silent voices.</p>

<p>The divine Disciples, when they saw the life of all come from the grave, with great
desire, right judgement and gladness of soul worshipped the risen Christ.</p>

<p>He who of old had lain for many years on a bed of pain, at your order, was made whole,
O Christ Giver of life and with hymns he glorified your compassion.</p>

now and guide us who have gained you as a fervent protector towards paths of life.</p>

therefore, O Christ, we praise your holy and divine Rising.</p>

<p>&#145;Why do you seek the living as one dead? He has risen. He is not in the tomb&#146;

<p>With a word you healed the Paralysed Man, who had lain sick for many years, and you
