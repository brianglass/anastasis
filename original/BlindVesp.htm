<p>O Lord, as you passed by on the way, you found a man blind from birth. Your Disciples
were amazed and asked you, saying, &#145;Teacher, who has sinned, this man or his parents,
that he was born blind?&#146; But you, my Saviour, cried out to them, &#145;Neither has he
sinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God might be revealed in him. I must do the
works of him who sent me, which none can do&#146;. So saying you spat on the ground, made
clay, and anointed his eyes, and said, &#145;Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam&#146;. When he
had washed he became whole and cried out to you: &#145;I believe Lord&#146;. And he
worshipped you. Therefore we too cry out: Have mercy on us!</p>

<p>Let us honour the Maiden, revered and worthy of God, in honour higher than the
Cherubim, for the Creator of all things, when he wished to become man, made his dwelling
ineffably in her, O strange deeds and wondrous mysteries! Who would not be amazed on
hearing this, that God becomes man? There was no change in him. He passed through the
gates of virginity and no diminution was left in her, as the Prophet says; No man will
ever pass through it, except the Lord, the God of Israel, who has great mercy.</font></p>

<p>Hail, seal of the Prophets, proclamation of Apostles inspired by God; for beyond
understanding and reason you bore the one who is truly God become incarnate for our sake.
Having regained our ancient nobility and enjoying the Paradise of delight, in hymns we
honour you, O All-holy, as cause of such splendour and as acceptable advocate, we who are
enriched with your everlasting entreaty that we may share the life of your Son, who richly
apportions his great mercy.</font></p>

Manna; lamp of the Son; shadowed mountain of God; bridal chamber that contained God; table
that provides life; golden lampstand; life-bearing Paradise; bush unburned; ark of
sanctification; heavenly ladder; living cloud; rod from Jesse&#146;s root that budded.
Implore Christ, O Virgin, to grant our souls his great mercy.</font></p>

<p>Verse: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The rich among the people of the land
will entreat your favour.</p>

<p>Hail, All-unblemished, who conceived the Son of God beyond all explanation, and gave to
birth him who had truly taken flesh for our sake from your blood, and had a soul with mind
and freewill. For having put on Adam whole and entire, he saved him , refashioning
humankind. Therefore Christ is proclaimed by us in two natures, displaying in himself the
properties of both. Implore him to grant to those who sing your praise his great mercy.</p>

<p>Through your precious Cross, O Christ, you have shamed the Devil; and by your
Resurrection you have blunted the sting of sin and you have saved us from the gates of
Death; we glorify you, Only-begotten. </p>

<p>He who gives resurrection to the human race like a sheep was led to the slaughter; the
princes of Hades trembled before him, and the gates of pain were lifted up; for Christ,
the King of glory had come in, saying to those in chains, &#145;Come forth!&#146; and to
those in darkness &#145;Reveal yourselves!&#146;</p>

<p>A mighty wonder! The immortal Creator of things invisible, having suffered in the flesh
for love of mankind, arose. Come families of the nations and let us worship him; for we,
delivered from error by his compassion, have learned to praise one God in three Persons.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>We offer you our evening worship, O light that knows no evening, who at the end of the
ages, as in a glass, shone on the world through the flesh and went down as far as Hades;
abolished the darkness there and showed the light of the resurrection to the nations.
Giver of life, O Lord, glory to you!</p>

<p>Let us glorify Christ, the author of our salvation; for by his rising from the dead the
world has been saved from error. The Angel choir rejoices, demons&#146; deception flees,
fallen Adam rises, the Devil has been overthrown.</p>

<p>The members of the guard were instructed by the transgressors: &#145;Conceal
Christ&#146;s Rising. Accept money and say: While we slept the body was stolen from the
tomb&#146;. Who ever saw, who ever heard of a corpse being stolen? Moreover one embalmed
and naked and that also abandoned its grave-clothes in the tomb? Do not be deceived, you
Jews; hear the sayings of the Prophets and know that he is truly the redeemer of the world
and all-powerful.</p>

<p>O Lord, our Saviour, who despoiled Hades and trampled on death; who enlightened the
world by your precious Cross, have mercy on us.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The man born blind reasoned with himself, &#145;Was it through my parents&#146; sin
that I was born blind? Or was I born because of the unbelief of the nations as an
accusation? I am not competent to ask when it is day, when night. My feet cannot detect
the stumbling blocks of the stones. I have not seen the sun shining, nor him who fashioned
me in his image. But I beg you, Christ God: Look on me and have mercy on me. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Twice</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">) </font></p>

with compassion for him put clay on his eyes and said to him, &#145;Go, wash in the Pool
of Siloam&#146;. He, having washed, gained his sight and gave glory to God. But his next
of kin said to him, &#145;Who opened the eyes which none of those with sight could
cure?&#146; But he cried out and said, &#145;A man called Jesus, he it was said to me:
Wash in the Pool of Siloam; and I gained my sight. He is truly Christ Messias of whom
Moses spoke in the Law; he is the Saviour of our souls&#146;.</p>

Moses the parter of the waters; here Gabriel the servant of the wonder. Then Israel
marched dry-shod through the deep; now the Virgin has given birth to Christ without seed.
The Sea after the passage of Israel remained untrodden; the Blameless after bearing
Emmanuel, remained incorrupt. O God, who exist and pre-exist, and who appeared as a man,
have mercy on us. </font></p>
