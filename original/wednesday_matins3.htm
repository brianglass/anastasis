<p>As your Mother watched you stretched out upon the Cross, pierced by the nails
and wounded in the side by the lance, lamenting she cried: Alas, my beloved
Child, how has the lawless people put you to death, who give life to those in
Hades? But arise quickly, and give joy to those you have loved.</p>

<p>Through a tree Adam became an exile from Paradise; but through the Tree of
the Cross the Thief made Paradise his home. For the one through tasting set
aside his Master’s commandment, while the other, crucified with him, confessed
the hidden God, as he cried: Remember me in your Kingdom.</p>
<p>Through your great loving kindness, O Christ, you were nailed to the Cross;
you were pierced in the side and became the source of two springs of
forgiveness, while the earth, unable to bear watching the shameless deed, heaved
and quaked, the rocks were rent, the sun was quenched, mountains and hills were
shaken with fear of your might.</p>
<p>Of old the hand of the Forefather Adam had been stretched out intemperately
to the tree of knowledge. To right his fall, O Christ, you were stretched out by
your own will and you were nailed by your hands, O Long suffering who fashioned
mankind with your hand through your infinite loving kindness. Glory, O Word, to
your compassion beyond understanding.</p>

<p>Making the earth a heaven, Holy Martyrs, by the surpassing splendours of your
contests, through them you dispelled all the darkness of vain folly and you came
to dwell with the unsetting light, made divine by participation, and you pour
the brilliance of the light of knowledge on all who fittingly call you blessed.</p>
<p ALIGN="center">Glory.</p>
<p>Worship, glory and honour let us bring to the Trinity, cause of all, offering
with thrice-holy words the hymn of the Angels. To the Father without beginning,
to the Son and Spirit we sing aloud and cry out the word of the good Thief:
Remember us also in your Kingdom.</p>

<p>When you saw your Son and God willingly hanged on a cross, O Most Pure, you
were amazed and weeping you said: How has your beauty set, O Lord, who made the
universe beautiful? Why has an ungrateful people repaid you like this for your
blessings? Glory, O Word, to your supreme loving kindness.</font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
