<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="6">FIFTY FIVE CHAPTERS</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Bangkok" size="5" color="#FF0000">Introduction</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4" face="Bangkok">This on one of a number of
sets of Beatitudes in the writings of the Greek Ephrem. They are in the nature of <em>apothegmata</em>.
They cover many aspects on monastic life, though their application is much wider. They
seem to have no particular arrangement, though from time to time thoughts on related
topics, or with linked images, appear to be grouped together. There are numerous allusions
to Holy Scripture, which I hope to add later. The curious expression <em>the skin of the
flesh</em> in number 48 is an allusion to the regulations for dealing with 'leprosy' in
Leviticus 13. St Ephrem uses it to refer to the visible, the physical, body, which,
despite its allure, will rot and exude putrefaction after death. As in a number of texts
in these writings, St Ephrem, towards the end of the series, is much preoccupied with
death and the coming judgement.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4" face="Bangkok">Like the similar set of
twenty beatitudes, which I hope to translate shortly, these fifty five beatitudes are
followed by a number of pages of continuous prose in the form of a sermon on the need for
repentance, which are prepared for by the final sentence, in the first person, of
Beatitude 55. This too I hope to translate before too long.</font></p>

      like, idle and pleasure-loving, will weep and lament as we watch our brothers in
      everlasting glory, while we are in torments.</font></li>
