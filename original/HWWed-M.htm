<p>The Midnight Office is read in the Church </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">and not, as usually on weekdays, in the

<p>After the Dismissal of the Midnight Office the Priest, having made the customary
metania to the Superior, or to his stall, enters the sanctuary and makes three bows before
the holy Table. He puts on the Epitrachelion and, standing in front of the holy Table,
intones:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Blessed is our God, always, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.</font></p>

<p>The Priest blesses the incense and begins to cense the sanctuary and the whole church
as usual.</p>

<p>The Reader begins:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#ff0000"><br>

<p>With three metanias; then the following two psalms.</p>

<p>Psalm 19</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may the
name of the God of Jacob shield you. May he send you his help from the holy place, and
support you from Sion. May he remember your every sacrifice, and accept with favour your
whole burnt offering. May the Lord give you your heart&#146;s desire, and fulfil your
every purpose. We shall rejoice in your salvation, and be magnified in the name of our the
Lord our God. May the Lord fulfil all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved
his Christ. He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty acts is the salvation of his
right hand. Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will call on the
name of the Lord our God. They were fettered and fell, but we have risen and been set
upright. Lord, save the king, and hear us on the day we call upon you.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Psalm 20</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">The king will rejoice in your power, O Lord, he will
exult exceedingly in your salvation. You gave him his heart&#146;s desire; you did not
deny him the request of his lips. For you came to meet him with blessings of goodness; you
placed a crown of precious stones upon his head. He asked you for life, and you gave him
length of days for age on age. Great is his glory because of your salvation; you will
place on him glory and majesty. For you will give him blessing for age on age, and make
him glad with the joy of your countenance. For the king puts his hope in the Lord, and
through the mercy of the Most High he will not be shaken. May your hand light upon all
your enemies, and your right hand find out all who hate you. You will make them like a
blazing oven at the time of your presence. The Lord will confound them in his wrath and
fire will devour them. You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their seed
from among the children of humankind. Because they intended evils against you, and devised
plans by which they can in no way succeed. For you will put them to flight; among your
remnants you will prepare their presence. Be exalted, Lord, in your power; we will sing
and praise your mighty acts.</font></p>

Superior, or the designated reader, with devotion and fear of God says:</font></p>

<p>Psalm 3</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, why have those who afflict me been multiplied?
Many rise against me. Many say to my soul, &#145;There is no salvation for him in his
God&#146;. But you, Lord, are my helper, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. With
my voice, I cried to the Lord, and he heard me from his holy mountain. I lay down and
slept; I awoke, because the Lord will assist me. I will not be afraid of tens of thousands
of people who surround me. Rise, Lord, save me, my God; because you have struck all who
are vainly my foes. You have smashed the teeth of sinners. Salvation is the Lord&#146;s,
and your blessing is upon your people.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 37</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chastise me
in your wrath. For your arrows have been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a heavy hand
upon me. There is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in my bones
on account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my head; like a heavy burden they
weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank and festered on account of my foolishness. I was
wretched and utterly bowed down; I went about mourning all day long. For my loins were
filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated
exceedingly; I howled from the groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you,
and my groaning was not hidden from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and
even the light of my eyes had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and
stood against me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life used
force, and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and meditated trickeries all day
long. But I, like a deaf man, heard nothing; like one who is dumb, who does not open his
mouth. So I became like one who cannot hear, and in whose mouth there are no rebukes. For
in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will answer me, O Lord my God. For I said: Let my foes
never exult over me. When my foot slipped they crowed over me. For I am ready for blows
and my pain is with me continually. For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my
sin. But my enemies live and have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly have
been multiplied. Those who repay me with evils in place of good have slandered me, since I
pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not go far from me. Hasten to help
me, Lord of my salvation.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 62</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">O God, my God, I watch for you at dawn; my soul has
thirsted for you, my flesh how often in a desert, untrodden and waterless land. Thus I
appeared before you in the holy place, to see your power and your glory. For your mercy is
better than life; my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live, and in
your name I will lift up my hands. May my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; my
mouth will praise you with joyful lips. When I remembered you upon my bed, every dawn I
meditated upon you. For you became my helper, and in the shelter of your wings I shall
rejoice. My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld me. But those who vainly sought
my life will go down to the deepest parts of the earth, they will be delivered to the
power of the sword, they will be portions for foxes. But the king will rejoice in God, and
all who swear by him will be praised; for the mouths of those who speak iniquities have

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day, and by
night also before you. Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to my
supplication. For my soul was filled with evils, and my life drew near to Hell. I was
reckoned among those that go down to the Pit; I became as one that has no help, free among
the dead. Like the slain that sleep in the tomb, whom you remembered no more; and they
were cut off from your power. They placed me in the lowest Pit; in darkness and in the
shadow of death. Your wrath lay heavy upon me, and you brought all your waves against me.
You put my friends far from me, and made me an abomination to them. I was handed over and
I came out; my eyes grew weak because of my beggary. I cried to you, Lord, all the day; I
stretched out my hands towards you. Will you work wonders for the dead; or will physicians
raise them up again to praise you? Will any declare your mercy in the tomb, or your truth
in the place of destruction? Will your wonders be known in the dark, or your justice in a
land that has been forgotten? But to you, Lord, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer
will come before you. Why have you rejected my soul, Lord; why do you turn away your face
from me? I am poor and in toils since my youth; exalted, I was humbled and brought to
despair. Your fierce anger overwhelmed me, and your terrors appalled me. They surrounded
me like water all day long; they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour
you have put far from me, and my companions because of my misery.</font></p>

<p>Psalm 102</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me,
bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of his benefits. He
forgives all your iniquities; he heals all your diseases; he redeems your life from
corruption and crowns you with mercy and compassion; he satisfies your desire with good
things; your youth will be renewed like an eagle&#146;s. The Lord performs deeds of mercy
and judgement for all who are oppressed. He made known his ways to Moses, his wishes to
the children of Israel. The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of
mercy. He will not always be wrathful, nor will he be enraged for ever. He has not dealt
with us according to our iniquities, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For, like the
height of heaven above the earth, the Lord has made his mercy prevail over those that fear
him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he taken our sins from us. As a
father takes pity on his children the Lord has taken pity on those who fear him. For he
knows of what we are made; has remembered that we are but dust. As for man, his days are
but as grass, he will blossom like a flower of the field; for when a wind has passed over
it, it will be no more and will know its place no longer. But the mercy of the Lord is for
ever and ever upon those who fear him; and his justice upon their children&#146;s
children, upon those who keep his covenant and remember his commandments to do them. The
Lord has prepared his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Bless the Lord, all
you his Angels, powerful in strength, who perform his word, and listen to the voice of his
words. Bless the Lord, all you his Powers, his Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord,
all you his works. In every place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul!</font></p>

supplication, and in your justice hear me. Do not enter into judgement with your servant:
for in your sight no one living can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul, humbled
my life to the ground. Made me dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit grew
despondent within me and my heart within me was troubled. I remembered days of old, I
meditated on all your works: I made the works of your hands my meditation. I stretched out
my hands towards you: my soul thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O
Lord, my spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who go
down to the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make
known to me the way in which I should walk, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver
me from my enemies, Lord: I have run to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you
are my God. Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land. For your name&#146;s sake,

<p>At that time the crowd that had been with Jesus when he called Lazarus out of the grave
and raised him from the dead bore witness. For this reason also the crowd went to meet
him: because they heard that he had performed this sign. So the Pharisees said to one
another, &#145;You see, you can do nothing. Look, the world has gone after him!&#146; Now
there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast. They came to
Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and made this request to him, &#145;Sir, we
wish to see Jesus.&#146; Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told
Jesus. Jesus answered them, &#145;The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
Amen, amen, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains
a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Those who love their life will lose
it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If anyone
would serve me, let them follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. If
anyone would serve me, the Father will honour them. Now my soul is troubled. And what
should I say? Father, save me from this hour. But it is for this reason that I have come
to this hour. Father, glorify your name&#146;. Then a voice came from heaven, &#145;I have
glorified it, and I will glorify it again.&#146; The crowd standing there heard it and
said that it had thundered. Others said, &#145;An angel has spoken to him.&#146; Jesus
answered, &#145;This voice has not come for my sake, but for yours. Now is the judgement
of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out. And I, when I am lifted up
from the earth, will draw all to myself.&#146; He said this to signify the kind of death
he was to die. The crowd answered him, &#145;We have heard from the law that the Christ
remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of
Man?&#146; Jesus said to them, &#145;The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while
you have the light, that the darkness may not overtake you. One who walks in the darkness,
does not know where they are going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so
that you may become children of light.&#146; After Jesus had said this, he departed and
hid from them. Although he had performed so many signs in their presence, they did not
believe in him, that the word spoken by the prophet Isaias might be fulfilled, &#145;Lord,
who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?&#146; And
so they could not believe, because Isaias also said, &#145;He has blinded their eyes and
hardened their heart, so that they might not look with their eyes, and understand with
their heart and turn back, and I will heal them.&#146; Isaias said this when he saw his
glory and spoke about him. Nevertheless many, even of the rulers, believed in him. But
because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, for fear that they would be put out of
the synagogue; for they loved human glory more than the glory of God. Then Jesus cried out
and said, &#145;Whoever believes in me believes not in me but in the One who sent me. And
whoever sees me sees the One who sent me. I have come as light into the world, so that
everyone who believes in me should not remain in the darkness. And if anyone who hears my
words and does not believe, I do not judge them, for I did not come to judge the world,
but to save the world. The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has one who
judges them; the word that I have spoken will judge them on the last day, for I have not
spoken on my own, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what
to say and what to speak. And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I speak,
therefore, I speak just as the Father has told me.&#146;</font></p>

<p>Psalm 50<br>
</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Have mercy on me, O God, in accordance with your
great mercy. According to the multitude of your compassion blot out my offence. Wash me
thoroughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my
wickedness, and my sin is ever before me. Against you alone I have sinned and done what is
evil in your sight, that you may be justified in your words and win when you are judged.
For see, in wickedness I was conceived and in sin my mother bore me. For see, you have
loved truth; you have shown me the hidden and secret things of your wisdom. You will
sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed. You will wash me and I shall be made
whiter than snow. You will make me hear of joy and gladness; the bones which have been
humbled will rejoice. Turn away your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Do not cast me out
from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me back the joy of your
salvation, and establish me with your sovereign Spirit. I will teach transgressors your
ways, and sinners will turn to you again. O God, the God of my salvation, deliver me from
bloodshed and my tongue will rejoice at your justice. Lord, you will open my lips, and my
mouth will proclaim your praise. For if you had wanted a sacrifice, I would have given it.
You will not take pleasure in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit; a
broken and a humbled heart God will not despise. Do good to Sion, Lord, in your good
pleasure; and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt. Then you will be well pleased with a
sacrifice of righteousness, oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer
calves upon your altar.</font></p>

<p>A harlot knowing you, the Son of the Virgin, to be God, imploring you with weeping, for
she had done things worthy of tears, said, &#145;Loose my debt, as I unloose my hair; love
one who loves, though justly hated, and along with tax-collectors I shall proclaim you, O
Benefactor, who love humankind&#146;.</p>

<p>[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">B</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">] Praise him with the sound of the trumpet; praise him with
lute and harp.</p>

<p>The harlot mixed the sweet myrrh of great price with tears, poured it over your
immaculate feet and kissed them. Her you justified at once, but grant us pardon, who
suffered for us and save us.</p>

<p>[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">A</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">] Praise him with timbrel and dance; praise him with strings
and pipe.</p>

<p>When the sinful woman offered myrrh, then the disciple made an agreement with the
lawless. The one rejoiced as she emptied out something of great price, while the other
hurried to sell the One beyond price. She acknowledged the Master; he was parted from the
Master. She was set free while Judas became the slave of the foe. Dreadful is sloth! Great
is repentance! Grant it to me, Saviour, who suffered for us, and save us.</p>

cymbals. Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.</p>

<p>O the wretchedness of Judas! He watched the harlot kissing your feet and began plotting
with guile the kiss of betrayal. She untied her locks and he was being bound by rage,
bringing foul-smelling wickedness instead of myrrh; for envy does not know how to prefer
its advantage. O the wretchedness of Judas! From it, O God, deliver our souls.</p>
