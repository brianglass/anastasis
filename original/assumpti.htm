<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the Prophecy of Isaias.<br>
[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">2,2-3</font>]</p>

<p>Thus says the Lord, It shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the
Lord shall be manifest, and the house of God from the peaks of the mountains; and it shall
be exalted high above the hills; and all the nations shall come to it; and many peoples
shall walk there, and shall say: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to
the house of the God of Jacob; and he will declare his way to us, and we will walk in it.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the Prophecy of Isaias.<br>
[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">62,10-63,3; 7-9</font>]</p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: Walk, go through my gates; prepare my way and make a way for my
people, and cast the stones out of the way; raise up a standard for the nations. For see,
the Lord has made it heard to the ends of the earth: Say to the daughter of Sion: See,
your Saviour has come, and his reward is with him, and his work before his face. And he
will call it a holy people, redeemed by the Lord; while you will be called a city sought
after, and not forsaken. Who is this who comes from Edom, the scarlet of his garments from
Bosor, thus beautiful in his apparel? He cries out with much strength. I reason of justice
and judgement of salvation. Why are your garments red, and your clothing as from a trodden
winepress? I am full of the trodden grape; I have trampled the winepress quite alone, and
no man from the nations was with me. I have remembered the mercy of the Lord, I will
recall the Lord&#146;s virtues, the Lord&#146;s praise for all the things with which He
rewards us. The Lord is a good judge for the house of Israel; he deals with us according
to his mercy and according to the multitude of his justice. And he said: Are you not my
people? Children will surely not be rebellious; and he became for them salvation out of
their every distress. It was not an emissary, not an Angel, but the Lord himself saved
them because he loved them and spared them. He redeemed them and took them up and exalted
them all the days of the age. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from the Prophecy of Zachary.<br>
[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">14,4; 8-11</font>]</p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: See, the day of the Lord is coming, and on that day his feet will
stand upon the mount of Olives, opposite Jerusalem, where the sun rises. And on that day
living water will come out from Jerusalem, half towards the first sea and half towards the
last sea; in spring and in summer it shall be so; and the Lord will be for a King over all
the earth; in that day there shall be one Lord, and his name, compassing all the earth and
the wilderness from Gabaa as far as Remmon, south of Jerusalem; and he shall be exalted
and remain on his place from the gate of Benjamin as far as the place of the first gate,
as far as the gate of Gomor and as far as the tower of Anameël and as far as the tower of
the corners and as far as the king&#146;s winepresses; they shall dwell in it and there
shall be no more curse and Jerusalem shall dwell confidently.</font></p>

united with it, so you suffered with it; as not subject to suffering, yet you suffered and

<p><strong>When he was with his Disciples before his passion, he promised them the coming
of the all-holy Spirit, saying, &#145;It is right that I go away. For if I do not go away,
the Paraclete will not come&#146;. And again, &#145;When he comes, he will teach you all
truth,. Therefore, after rising from the dead, he appeared to them for forty days, not the
whole time, but at intervals, eating and drinking with them, proving the resurrection more
surely. Finally, after promising many things about the kingdom of God, he ordered them not
to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there to receive the coming of the all-holy Spirit, and
they would also be baptised through him. For they had formerly only been baptised in water
by John (though later Epiphanios of Cyprus recounted that John the Theologian baptised the
Mother of God, while Peter and he baptised the rest of the Apostles). He ordered them to
remain in Jerusalem so that the first proclamation of the Gospel might be confirmed there,
lest, by leaving for foreign places, they might be easily misrepresented. And because it
was necessary, as it is for soldiers, for them to be armed with the weapons of the Spirit
and so go out to battle with the enemies of Christ.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When the moment came for the assumption, he led them out to the Mount of Olives
(so called because it was planted with many olive trees). He talked with them of the
preaching to the ends of the earth and also of his perpetual kingdom that was to come, and
when he saw that they were about to ask him what was fitting, his most pure Mother being
present also, he brought Angels to show them his ascent to heaven. And indeed, as the
watched, he was lifted up from among them and a cloud received him. And so, escorted by
the Angels, who exhorted one another to raise the doors of heaven and were amazed at
scarlet of his flesh from his blood, he ascended and took his seat at the right hand of
the Father, making his flesh divine and, I dare to say, making it equal to God. Through it
we have been changed, now that the ancient enmity has been abolished. However, Angels
appeared to the Apostles, in the form of men, and said, &#145;Men of Galilee, why do you
stand amazed, straining your gaze to heaven? The one whom you see in flesh, God Jesus,
will come like this again in flesh. But not as before, in poverty and unknown, but with
great glory, as you now see him, escorted by Angels&#146;.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Then the Apostles, tired by gazing up, returned from the Mount of Olives, which
is very near Jerusalem, about two thousand four hundred steps, for this is a Sabbath
day&#146;s journey. For so it was laid down by Moses as lawful to walk for this distance
on Sabbath. Because the Tent of Witness was this number of steps distant from the Jewish
camp. So it was possible for worshippers to go this far on Sabbath and not to walk
further. And so it called a Sabbath day&#146;s journey. Some have though because of this
that Christ&#146;s Assumption took place of Sabbath, which is incredible.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Apostles, having returned, went up into the Upper Room, where they remained
with the Myrrhbearing Women and the Mother of the Word, devoting themselves to fasting,
prayer and supplication, waiting for the promised descent of the all-holy Spirit. </strong></font></p>

<p>The princes of the Angels, Saviour, as they saw the strangeness of your ascent, were
perplexed and said to one another, &#145;What is this sight? Human he seems in form, yet
as God he ascends with a body far above the heavens&#146;.</p>

<p>The men of Galilee, seeing you, O Word, taken up from the mount of Olives with a body,
heard Angels crying out to them, &#145;Why do you stand gazing? He will come again in the
flesh in the same way that you have seen him&#146;.</p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>In the first book, Theophilos, I dealt with all that Jesus did and taught from the
beginning until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commandment through the
Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. He presented himself alive to them by many
proofs after his passion, appearing to them during forty days, and speaking about the
kingdom of God. And while staying with them he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to
wait for the promise of the Father, &#145;which&#146;, he said, &#145;you heard from me,
for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days
from now.&#146; So when they had come together, they asked him, &#145;Lord, is this the
time when you are going to restore the kingdom to Israel?&#146; He said to them, &#145;It
is not for you to know times or moments which the Father has fixed by his own authority.
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you; and you will be my
witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the very ends of the
earth.&#146; And when he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a
cloud took him out of their sight. And while they were gazing into heaven as he went,
behold, two men stood by them in white robes, who said, &#145;Men of Galilee, why do you
stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will
come in the same way as you have seen him go into heaven.&#146; Then they returned to
Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey
away.</font></p>
