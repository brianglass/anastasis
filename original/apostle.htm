What should we call you.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>What should I name you, Apostle? Heaven, for you declare the glory of God. River, for
mystically you water creation. Star, which sheds its light on the Church. Mixing-bowl,
which pours out a holy draught. True Friend of Christ. Companion of the Bodiless Powers.
Intercede that our souls may be saved.</p>

<p>Apostle, truly inspired, you were sent out from Christ like a thunderbolt formed of
light, wounding enemies, plainly predicting healing for wounded souls; and so, as is
fitting, we call you blessed and celebrate today your holy festival. Intercede that our
souls may be saved.</p>

<p>Glorious Apostle, who saw God, your feet were made beautiful as they trod the ways of
the Lord, and narrowed the ways of the ill-intentioned by the broadening of the divine
knowledge of the Word, who appeared in a material body and chose you, blessed one, as a
glorious Disciple. Implore him that our souls may be saved.</p>

fullest grace.</font></p>

<p>When the Ewe-lamb who bore you saw you nailed to the Tree, Lord, she tore at her eyes
and cried aloud in lamentation, &#145;My Son, how do you endure unjust slaughter? How can
you, the Immortal, die as a mortal? Give me a word, sweetest light. Look at your Mother as
she mourns for you, and glorify her, O Word, by your rising&#146;.</p>
