<p>The Martyrs, with heart and soul that leap for joy, dwell in realms above,
having obtained forever the marks of Christ as a fair adornment, and for us they
entreat peace, the removal of dangers and release from faults.</p>
<p>Godly Athletes, every place which in dangers has obtained your relics like a
second Ark of Israel is made holy; while Heaven rejoices with the Bodiless
Powers for it has obtained your souls, blessed Martyrs.</p>

strengthen me against the passions and every assault of the boaster that guided

<p>Fair turtle-dove and sweet-voiced swallow you have been revealed, godlike
Forerunner, harbinger of Christ the divine spring; beseech him that I may be
delivered from the soul-destroying winter and the tempest of sin I implore you.</p>
<p>By leaping in your mother's womb you revealed him who shone from a Virgin;
implore him to slay the leapings of the flesh which slay me and to fill my heart
with joy, that I may hymn you, godlike Forerunner.</p>
<p>Merciless is the judgement, O soul, for those who do not show mercy; see,
take care, put oil in your lamp which can keep you unsleeping; the Bridegroom is
at hand, watch lest you have your purpose quenched.</p>

<p>Holy Martyrs, by bravely proclaiming Christ in the stadium you have become
companions of the Angels, for you abandoned all pleasures in the world as unreal
and held fast to the faith as a sure anchor; therefore too having driven out
error you are a source of gifts of healings for the faithful as you intercede
without ceasing that our souls may be saved.</p>

<p>Through a tree Adam became an exile from Paradise; but through the Tree of
the Cross the Thief made Paradise his home. For the one through tasting set
aside his Master’s commandment, while the other, crucified with him, confessed
the hidden God, as he cried: Remember me in your Kingdom.</p>
<p>O Christ the Word, who accepted Peter’s weeping and the Harlot’s tears
and the Publican when he only sighed, take pity too on me, as you are
compassionate, as I fall down and beg that I be granted pardon of offences.
Supremely loving Lord, ransom me from Hell in the other world as you are
compassionate.</p>
<p>Great Forerunner, who loosed the bonds of sterility, loose the barrenness of
my wretched heart and by your mediation help it on the way to bear deeds of
virtue; through which I shall receive inexhaustible life, as I cry: Remember me,
Saviour, in your Kingdom.</p>
