<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Reading is from Genesis<br>
[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">49:1-12</font>]</p>

<p>Then Jacob called his sons, and said to them, &#145;Gather round, that I may tell you
what will happen to you in the last days. Assemble and hear me, sons of Jacob. Hear
Israel, hear your father. Juda, your brothers shall praise you. Your hand will be on the
back of your enemies. Your father&#146;s sons will bow down before you. Juda is a
lion&#146;s whelp. From a tender shoot, my son, you have gone up. He crouches down, he
stretches out like a lion, like a whelp. Who will rouse him? A ruler will not fail from
Juda, nor a leader from his thighs, until the things laid up for him come, and he is the
expectation of the nations. Binding his foal to the vine and his ass&#146;s colt to the
branch, he will wash his robe in wine and his cloak in the blood of the grape. His eyes
are more cheering than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The reading is from the Prophecy of Sophonias.<br>
[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">3:14-19</font>]</p>

<p>Thus says the Lord, &#145;Rejoice, daughter of Sion. Shout, daughter of Jerusalem!
Rejoice and exult with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem! The Lord has taken away your
iniquities, he has ransomed you from the hand of your enemies. The king of Israel, the
Lord, is in your midst. You shall see evils no more. At that time the Lord will say to
Jerusalem, &#145;Be of good courage, Sion Do not let your hands grow weak. The Lord, your
God, is in your midst. The Mighty One will save you. He will bring joy upon you and renew
you by his love. He will rejoice over you with delight, as on a day of festival. And I
will gather your afflicted. Alas! Who has taken up a reproach against you? I will work for
your sake at that time. And I will save her that was oppressed and receive her who was
rejected, and I will make them a boast and famed in all the earth&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The reading is from the Prophecy of Zachary.<br>
[<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">9:9-15</font>]</p>

<p>Rejoice greatly, daughter of Sion! Shout aloud, daughter of Jerusalem! See, your king
comes to you, just and bringing salvation. He is meek and riding on beast of burden, on a
young colt. He will utterly destroy the chariots from Ephraim and the war horse from
Jerusalem. And the battle bow he will utterly destroy, and there shall be abundance of
peace out of the nations, and he will rule over the waters as far as the sea, and from
rivers unto the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant
with you, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. You shall dwell in your
strongholds, prisoners of the congregation. For one day of your exile I will repay you
double. For I have bent you Juda as bow for myself. I have filled Ephraim and I will
arouse your children, O Sion, against the children of the Greeks, and handle you like a
warrior&#146;s sword. Then the Lord will appear over them, and he will go forth like a
lightning bolt. The Lord Almighty will sound the trumpet and march forth in the tumult of
his threat. The Lord Almighty will protect them.</font></p>

and Resurrection. As he drew near Jerusalem for his voluntary Passion, the people that sat
in darkness and the shadow of death, taking the symbols of victory, boughs of trees and
branches of palms, foretold his Resurrection. Do you, Master, yourself keep and preserve
us also, who, following their example, on this day before the Feast carry palms and
branches in our hands and, like those crowds and those children, offer you our
&#145;Hosanna!&#146;, so that with hymns and spiritual songs we may be counted worthy of

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua" size="3">After the raising of Lazarus from the dead, many
people saw what had happened and began to believe in Jesus. A decision was taken by the
synagogue of the Jews to kill both Christ and Lazarus. Jesus therefore flees, giving place
to evil, while the Jews were planning to kill him during the Feast of Passover. When a
considerable time had been given to flight, Jesus came six days before Passover, as
Scripture says, to Bethany, where Lazarus, the one who had been dead, was. And there a
meal took place at which Lazarus also was eating with him. But his sister Mary poured
sweet perfume over his feet. And the next day he sent his Disciples to bring the ass and
her colt. And he who has heaven as his throne, mounted on the colt entered Jerusalem. The
children of the Hebrews threw their garments over it and, cutting down branches of palm
trees and carrying others in their hands, they went ahead of him crying out, &#145;Hosanna
to the Son of David. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of
Israel&#146;. This happened because the All-Holy Spirit moved their tongues to praise and
extol Christ. They showed this through the Palms [Baïa], that is the branches (Baïon is
what the Hebrews call the soft branch) which signified in advance the victory of Christ
over death. For it was the custom for the victors in contests or wars to be honoured and
escorted in the victory processions with branches of evergreen trees. The colt on the
other hand signified us, the people from the nations, on which Christ, seated and resting
upon it as victor and conqueror, was proclaimed as King of the whole earth. Of this Feast
the Prophet Zachary said, &#145;Rejoice greatly, daughter of Sion. See, your King comes to
you, meek and seated on a beast of burden and a colt of an ass, offspring of a beast of
burden&#146;. And David again says of the Children, &#145;From the mouth of babes and
sucklings you have made sure of praise.&#146; But as Christ entered, Scripture says, all
Jerusalem was shaken and the crowds, provoked to vengeance by the Chief Priests, were
looking to make away with him. But he avoided them by hiding and showing himself, and he
spoke to them in parables.</font></p>

<p>Brethren, rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. Let all men know your
forbearance. The Lord is at hand. Be anxious about nothing, but in everything by prayer
and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace
of God, which passes all understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ
Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honourable, whatever is just,
whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence, if
there is anything worthy of praise, think on these things. What you have learned and
received and heard and seen in me, do; and the God of peace will be with you.</font></p>
