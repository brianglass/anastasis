BORN BLIND</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">BY</font><br>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" COLOR="#ff0000" size="5">SAINT JOSEPH OF THESSALONIKI</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>The canon for the feast of the Man Born Blind is by St Joseph of Thessaloniki [Feast
day 14 July], the brother of St Theodore the Studite. He is also the author of the canons
for the two preceding Sundays, that for the eve of the Assumption, commonly called the
Ascension, and the second canon for the feast itself. He usually signs his compositions
with his name </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">JOSEPH</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> as an acrostic in the ninth ode. This is preserved in the
following translation.</p>

<p>Like all the canons for the Sundays of Pascha, this canon seems originally to have been
intended to stand alone, since only one troparion deals with the subject of the feast, the
others forming, in effect, a standard Resurrection canon. </p>

<p>The subject first troparion of all the odes is the Crucifixion and of the fourth the
Blind Man, and every ode ends with a Triadikon and a Theotokion. The first two odes have a
similar pattern, which is found elsewhere in the liturgical texts. The subject of the
first troparion is the Cross, of the second the &#145;noble Joseph&#146; , of the third
the Myrrhbearers and the fourth the Blind Man. Some of the later odes, with their
allusions to Acts 1 and Luke 24, look forward to the coming feast of the Assumption.</p>

<p>I have not included detailed references to holy Scripture, though there are many in the
text. The phrase &#145;right Spirit&#146; in the Triadikon of the 9th ode is a quotation
from Psalm 50, but because it sounds somewhat strange in English I have placed it in
inverted commas.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 1. Tone 5. The Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Israel passed dry-shod, O Lord, over earth on which the sun had never shone, had never
seen; deep which the vault of heaven had never seen naked; and you led him to the mountain
of your sanctification as he sang and chanted a song of victory.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>By willingly accepting crucifixion in the flesh, you have become a source of blessing
and life for the world, O Master, only all-blessed and Creator of all; therefore we bless
you, we hymn and glorify you, as we sing and chant a song of victory.</p>

<p>When you were dead, O long-suffering, the noble Joseph laid you in the lowest pit and
rolled a stone to the door of the grave; but you rose in glory, raising the world with
you, as it sang and chanted a song of victory.</p>

<p>The Angel appeared and said to the holy women: Why do you bring spices with tears?
Christ has risen! Run, tell the Disciples who have seen God, as they mourn and weep, so
that they may leap and dance for joy.</p>

<p>Extraordinary wonders the Redeemer performs; he even cured a man blind from birth,
anointing him with clay and saying: Go, wash in Siloam, that you may know that I am God
who walk the earth bearing flesh because of my compassionate pity.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Triadikon.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Honouring one Essence in three Persons, let us the faithful glorify the Father and the
Son and the right Spirit, maker and Lord, and redeemer of all, one uncreated God, as we
cry with the Bodiless hosts: Holy, Holy, Holy are you, O King!</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Theotokion.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Because of his compassionate pity the Lord dwelt in your womb that had not known
wedlock, O Pure one, for he wished to save mankind which had perished through the wiles of
the foe: implore him then that this city may be saved from every capture and invasion by
foes.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 3. The Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>O Lord, make firm my heart, shaken by the waves of life, as God guiding it to a fair
haven.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Long-suffering Lord, you made firm the hearts of those who are shaken when you shook
the earth, by your hallowed Crucifixion, which you underwent in the flesh.</p>

<p>The noble Joseph laid you in a new tomb, O merciful; but you arose from the dead on the
third day, renewing us all.</p>

<p>Why do you seek the Lord as a corpse? He has risen as he said, cried the Angel to the
women, dazzling with his godlike form.</p>

<p>You once cured a man blind from birth who came to you, All-merciful, glorifying your
dispensation and your wonders.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Triadikon.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>By being placed on a Tree you, who are life, brought me, who had died through a tree,
back to life through your great mercy. Therefore, O Word, I glorify you.</p>

<p>Marvellously assembled together with your Initiates, O Lord, you said to them: Go
forth, proclaim my Resurrection everywhere.</p>

<p>Confirming your Rising from the grave, Lord, for many days you assembled together with
your friends, and made them joyful.</p>

<p>You gave sight to a man Blind from the womb, Lord, when you said: Go, wash and receive
your sight, and glorify my Godhead.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Triadikon.</font></p>

passions, and make your rays clear as day shine in me, O spiritual Sun, to turn my night
into light.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You were lifted up on a Tree, and lifting up all mortals with yourself, O merciful, you
put to death the hostile serpent and, as only God of all, gave life to what your hands had
fashioned.</p>

<p>Willingly you became a corpse and were laid in a tomb, immortal King, and you emptied
all the palaces of Hell, raising the dead by your Resurrection.</p>

<p>When you had accomplished great marvels upon earth, O Word, a lawless people slew you;
but, being alone powerful, Lord Christ, you rose, as you had foretold, from the dead.</p>

<p>Having opened the eyes of one who had not seen the natural light, you enlightened the
pupils of his soul and led him to give glory when he recognised you as maker, through
compassion seen as a mortal. </font></p>

and God.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Ode 6. The Irmos.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>As you delivered the Prophet from the beast, O Lord, bring me too, I pray, from the
deep of ungovernable passions; that I may look again towards your holy temple.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Troparia.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Crucified with thieves, O Master, from evil thieves and soul-destroying passions, you
delivered us who praise in harmony your Crucifixion and your Rising, O Lord who loves
mankind.</p>

<p>A lifeless corpse they laid you in a tomb, O Christ, who breathe life into all the
dead; but you arose, Lord, emptying all the graves, O Word, by your sovereign power.</p>

<p>After your Rising, O Christ, you said to your friends: Tarry in Jerusalem, until you
are clothed with invincible strength and sure support from on high.</p>

<p>You made clay, and anointed the eyes of the man Blind from birth, and you gave him the
grace of sight as he hymned your immaculate power, through which you saved the world.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>When you were hung upon the Tree, O Saviour, the sun was quenched, the earth heaved,
all creation was shaken, and the dead were raised from the graves.</p>

<p>When you rose from the dead, O King, the souls which slept there were raised with you
and glorified your sovereign power, through which the bonds of death were loosed.</p>

<p>At dawn a choir of women came to anoint you, but learning that you had risen, Lord,
they rejoiced with the sacred Disciples; through whom grant us redemption from evils.</p>

<p>You anointed with clay the eyes of the man born Blind and you ordered him to go to
Siloam: having washed he gained his sight as he hymned you, O Christ, King of all.</font></p>

under guard since time began, O Christ, as they hymned your love for mankind.</p>

<p>Having accomplished extraordinary marvels, you were willingly lifted up on a cross and
joined with the dead, O Christ, and you put Hell to death and with courage released all
its prisoners.</p>
