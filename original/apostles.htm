<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>As eye witnesses and ones who testified to the incarnation of the Word, O truly happy
disciples, you are called blessed, for shining like flashes of lightning, you appeared to
the world, and like spiritual mountains you dripped sweetness; divided like ever-flowing
rivers of Paradise, you water the churches of the nations with divine streams.</p>

<p>Like thunderbolts, blazing with the beams of the Spirit, you were sent out through all
the world, granting ungrudgingly the force of wonders, ministers of the mysteries of
Christ and written tablets of God&#146;s grace, inscribed by God with the law taught by
God, all-blessed initiates.</p>

<p>The rod of the fishermen troubled the arrogance of philosophers and the eloquence of
rhetors; for they clearly set out the teachings of divine wisdom, the doctrines of graces
and the Gospel of ten thousand blessings, the participation in eternal delight, the
pleasures of angels and enduring glory.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now. </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">Theotokion.</font></p>

<p>We, who are much storm-tossed on the sea of the troubles and harsh difficulties of
life, have you as the most sheltered haven of salvation, and as gentle calm; and so we all
have recourse to you as we cry out: Never cease to stand by your servants.</font></p>

of divine grace from the wool of your Offspring.</p>

<p>As I long to sing the choir of the Apostles, grant me, O Christ, as God, at their
intercessions, the ray of the all-holy Spirit and the lamp of your wisdom.</p>

<p>Your revered Apostles, O Christ, given strength by your strength and grace, made
godlike by their unyielding inclinations towards you, triumphed over the power of hostile
foes.</p>

<p>Performing healings, Master, in your name, your far-famed Apostles, caught the
gatherings of the nations with your knowledge and made them shine with your light.</p>

<p>Made disciples by heavenly wisdom, glorious Apostles of Christ, you clearly made
foolish all the useless verbiage of the wise by the brevity of the proclamation.</font></p>

<p>You revealed your disciples, Master, as spiritual heavens, who declare all your glory

<p>With the net of the divine words you caught the rational fish and brought them as
first-fruits to our God, and longing to put on the marks of Christ you were revealed as
imitators of his Passion, glorious Apostles; therefore we have come together and honour as
is fitting your all-festive memorial, and with one voice we cry out to you: Intercede with
Christ God to bestow forgiveness of faults on those who celebrate with love your holy

<p>The sound of the divine words of the Apostles has passed like a torch of fire through
the whole inhabited world, burning up the fuel of error, but enlightening by grace the
companies of the devout.</p>

<p>The Disciples, appearing like beacons lit by God, made the world, blackened by the fog
of godlessness, bright by the rays of grace and the beams of the proclamation.</p>

<p>Dazzling with most sacred lamps of the spiritual Sun, you shine in the world like the
sun, all-praised Apostles, by the light of the godhead, as you chase away the fog of
error.</p>

<p>With your Cross as a rod of power, O Word, your eye-witnesses cut through the salt sea
