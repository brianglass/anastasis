<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">The feast seems to have fallen in the
second half of May in the year that St Theodore gave this instruction, since he
refers to the recent celebration of St Pachomius, whose feast falls on 15 May.</font></p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">The quotation from 1 Timothy 3,16 is one
of the key quotations in the liturgical texts for the feast. All the texts in
the New Testament speak of Christ’s being ‘taken up’, and this language
has been preserved in the hymns of the Church. The Greek name of the feast means
‘Assumption’, not ‘Ascension’, which comes from the Latin name for the
feast.</font></p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Apart from the necessary change of person
in the verb, the whole clause ‘he descended into the lowest parts of the
earth’ is the opening of the Irmos of the 6th Ode of St John of Damascus’s
Easter Canon, which St Theodore would have known.</font></p>

7</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4"><font color="#ff0000">On
the Assumption of our Saviour Jesus Christ<br>
and on conducting ourselves in a manner pleasing to God</font><i>.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Brethren and fathers, a feast of feasts,
the Assumption of our Saviour Jesus Christ, is at our doors, and a great and
supernatural mystery; for our nature is being taken up beyond heaven, as it
written: <i>By grace you have been saved; and he has raised us up together and
made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,</i>[Ephesians
2,5-6] <i>who is at the right hand of God</i>, [Romans 8,34] <i>far above every
principality and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named,
not only in this age, but in that which to come. And he has put all things under
his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the Church, which is his
body, the fullness of him who fills all in all</i>. [Ephesians 1,22-23]</font></p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Do you see then to what height of glory
human nature has been raised? Is it not from earth to heaven? Is it not from
corruption to incorruption? How hard would not someone toil in order to become
the intimate friend of a corruptible king here below? But we, although we were
alienated and hostile in our intent by evil deeds, have not only been reconciled
to God the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, but we have also soared aloft
to sonship, and now our nature is worshipped in the heavens by every creature
seen and unseen. Such is the mighty work of the ineffable love for mankind of
our good God, and with this in mind the blest Apostle cried out: <i>What is the
hope of his calling, and what the wealth of the glory of his inheritance in the
saints, and what the exceeding greatness of his power towards us who believe,
according to the working of the might of his strength which he worked in Christ?</i>
{Ephesians 1,18-20] For what came to pass? He who is supremely good came to us
through a virgin birth, he became a slave to the normal laws of nature, he
ascended the cross, nailing to it the record against us, he descended <i>to the
lowest parts of the earth </i>[Psalm 138,15] and abolished the pains of death
and raised humanity with himself, finally <i>he was taken up in glory </i>{1
Timothy 3,18], manifesting himself for us to God the Father.</font></p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">These then briefly are the events of the
holy feast. And as we contemplate them, brethren, and because we are the body of
Christ, let us reverence the gift, let us preserve the nobility, let us not
betray the grace, let us not <i>make the members of Christ members of a harlot</i>;
[1 Corinthians 6,15] but let us sanctify ourselves in both thoughts and deeds,
let us yet refrain <i>from carnal desires that war against the soul</i>,[1 Peter
2,11] maintaining good conduct in ourselves, peaceable, compliant, obedient,
humble, reliable. And this is the blessed life: but pleasures and trifles,
occasions of laughter and dissoluteness and all such inordinate behaviour should
be left to the lovers of the flesh and to the lovers of life, who see and do not
see and hear and do not hear, for their hearts are insensitive [Cf. Mark
8,17-18] and their ears blocked up so as not to distinguish good from bad, light
from darkness, life from death, but so as to go towards the fire that is ready.
For the desire of the flesh is fire, and yet they rush towards it unbridled;
love of money is a pit, and yet deep embedded they do not cease to follow their
self-chosen demon and to be entitled to be called miserable rather than blessed,
because despising what is truly good they embrace rather perishable corruption.</font></p>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">But we, brethren, let us hold fast to the
confession <i>in which we stand, and let us boast in the hope of the glory of
God</i>, [Romans 5,2] let us keep to the discipline in which the saints
disciplined themselves, as indeed did the blessed Pachomius, whom we recently
celebrated. Let us see healthily, let us hear healthily, let us touch healthily,
using all our members healthily, so that guided by the word and as servants of
the word we may become inheritors of eternal life according to the promise, [Cf.
1 Timothy 4,8] in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be the glory and the might with
the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
