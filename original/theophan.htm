<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="5">ST THEOPHANES THE BRANDED [775-845]</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">Next to St Joseph the Hymnographer the major
contributor to the weekday <a href="http://default/anastasis/oktoich.htm"><i>Paraklitiki</i></a>
was St Theophanes, bishop of Nicea. His life is told in the life of Michael the Synkellos,
of which an excellent translation has been published by Dr Mary Cunningham. Michael and
his two disciples, the brothers Theodore and Theophanes, originally left Jerusalem in 813
on a journey to Rome, sent by the Patriarch of Jerusalem to support the Pope in his stand
against the Franks over the question of the <i>filioque</i>, which some Benedictines from
the West had recently introduced to Jerusalem. Known for their support of the Seventh
Council, they were detained in Constantinople, interrogated, beaten and imprisoned by Leo
V in 815. During the whole of the second iconoclast period, nearly thirty years, they
suffered at various times exile, imprisonment and torture, including the infamous
tattooing on their faces of twelve lines of &#145;badly composed&#146;&#151; the
emperor&#146;s own words &#151;, if metrically correct, quantitative iambics. Theodore
died in prison in 841, but his brother and Michael both survived to see Orthodoxy triumph.
Theophanes was appointed metropolitan of Nicea and Michael abbot of the monastery of
Chora, where he died just two months after Theophanes in January 846.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4">As a hymnographer St Theophanes belongs to the
tradition of the monastery of Mar Sabbas, near Bethlehem, which includes many of the
greatest writers of canons, including St Andrew of Crete, St Kosmas Maïouma and St John
of Damascus. His contribution to the <i>Paraklitiki</i> consists of sets of canons in all
eight tones for the Angels, and the Departed. He is sometimes said also to have written a
set for the Apostles, but those in Tones 7 and 8 are ascribed to Joseph in the <i>Paraklitiki</i>,
that in Tone 7 being &#145;signed&#146; in the ninth ode. Not all of these are
&#145;signed&#146; in the acrostic, but that for the Angels in tone 1 has as its acrostic
the following, &#145;The first hymn of Theophanes for the Angels&#146;, while that for the
departed in tone 5 has, &#145;The fifth canon of Theophanes for the dead&#146;.
Unfortunately none of these texts has been critically edited and the printed service books
often differ widely in their ascriptions.</font></p>
