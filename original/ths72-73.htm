<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">On the saving Passion; and teaching
on humility and patient endurance.<br>
Given on the Wednesday of Holy Week.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Brethren and Fathers, the present day is holy and to
be venerated, for from this day the Lord begins to take on himself the sufferings of the
Cross for our sake, in accordance with David’s words: <i>Why did the nations rage and the
peoples imagine vain things? The kings of the earth rose up and the rulers assembled
together against the Lord and against his Christ </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[Psalm 2:1-2]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">. They
assembled together to plot an evil plan against the Master. The deceitful Judas denied him
utterly and betrays the teacher with a deceitful kiss. The Lord of all things is led away
prisoner, stands before the judgement seat, is interrogated and answers; and when he
answers&#151;O fearful report!&#151;he is struck by a slave and bears it with
longsuffering, saying: <i>If I have spoken evil, give testimony to the evil; but if well,
why do you strike me? </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[John 18:23]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> Then he is scoffed at, mocked, jeered at, ridiculed, spat
at, buffeted, scourged. He ascends the Cross, and when he has ascended he prays for his
murderers: <i>Father, forgive them their sin, for they do not know what they do </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[Luke 23:33]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">. Then
he is given gall with vinegar to drink, he is pierced by a lance, the immortal is put to
death. These in brief are the Master's sufferings, and one who hears them with
understanding is not angry, or embittered, or enraged, or puffed up, or arrogant towards
his brother; is not envious, or filled with vainglory. Rather he is humbled, crushed,
considers himself to be earth and ashes, desires communion in Christ's sufferings, to is
eager to be conformed to his death, so that he may have a part in the glory of his
resurrection. But you too take courage, because you have shared and are sharing in the
Master's sufferings. For you see where you are. Is it not for the sake of his word and his
testimony that you are in exile and persecution? </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[These
Catecheses were given when St Theodore and his monks were in exile from Constantinople in
the reign of Michael II (820-829).]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> Have you not
previously experienced prison? Have you not shed your blood under tortures? Have not some
of our brothers died a martyr's death? Such then is our boast in the Lord, such our gift.
But since until the end beatitude is not assured because of the ease of reversal and the
impossibility of knowing what the morrow will bring to birth, stand your ground
unflinching and unmoving in the Lord <i>striving side by side with one spirit and one soul
for the faith of the Gospel, in no way intimidated by your opponents</i> </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[Phil. 1:27-6]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">, <i>not
giving offence in anything, but in everything recommending ourselves as God's ministers </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[2 Cor. 6:3-4]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">, by
obedience, humility, meekness, longsuffering, great endurance. <i>For you need endurance
in order to do God's will and obtain the promise. For in a little while he who is coming
will come and not delay </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[Heb 10:36-37</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">]. But if he will come and not delay, why do we hate being in
afflictions and do not rather choose to die each day for the Master? For it is written: <i>If
we have died with him, we shall also live with him; if we endure, we shall also reign with
him; if we disown him, he will also disown us; if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful;
he cannot disown himself </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[1 Tim. 2:11-13]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">. How great joy the saints will have when they see the Lord <i>coming
from heaven with the angels of his power </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[2
Thess. 1:7]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">, inviting them with inexpressible
joy, crowning them and becoming their companion for ever and ever? What anguish will they
have who have disobeyed the Gospel and transgressed his commandments? <i>They will suffer
the penalty, as it is written, of eternal destruction, cut off from his presence and from
the glory of his strength, when he comes to be glorified in his saints and marvelled at
among all who have believed </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[2 Thess.
1:9-10]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">. And so, brethren, as we contemplate and
think on these things, again and again <i>let us purify ourselves from every defilement of
flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[2 Cor, 7:1]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">, zealous for
what is better, striving for what is more perfect, <i>hating what is evil, holding fast to
what is good, loving one another with brotherly affection, outdoing one another in showing
honour, not lagging in zeal, being ardent in spirit, serving the Lord, rejoicing in hope,
patient in affliction, persevering in prayer </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[Rom.
12:9-12]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">, that by such sincerity we may worthily
celebrate the imminent Pascha, and be counted worthy to enjoy the eternal blessings in
Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory and might with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now
and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" size="6" color="#800080">CATECHESIS 73</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">On the saving passion of our Lord and
Master Jesus Christ.<br>
Given on Good Friday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Brethren and Fathers, while the sufferings of our
Lord Jesus Christ when they are recalled are always able to pierce the soul, they do so
especially in these present days, on which each of them reached its end. What then are
they? The murderous council against him, the Jewish arrest, his being led away to death,
his arraignment before Pilate's tribunal, the interrogation, the scourging, the blows, the
spittings, the insults, the mockeries, the ascent of the Cross, the nailing of his hands
and feet, the tasting of gall, the piercing of his side and all the other things which
blazed forth </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[This word is not in the lexica,
but the meaning is clear.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"> with them, which the
world cannot contain, nor can anyone worthily proclaim, not human tongue, nor even all the
tongues of angels together. For let us consider, brethren, this great and ineffable
mystery. The Lord <i>who reveals the counsels of hearts</i> </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[1 Cor. 4:5] </font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">and knows every
human desire is the one who is taken before a council of death; the Lord <i>who bears all
things by the word of his power</i> </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[Hebrews
1:3.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">is the one who is handed over to sinners;
the Lord <i>who binds the water in the clouds </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[Job 26:8.] </font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">and sows in the
earth in due season and uniformly is the one who is led away prisoner; the Lord <i>who
measures the heavens with the span of his hand and the earth in a handful and weighed all
the mountains in the balance</i> </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[Isaias 40:12.]
</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">is the one who is struck by the hand of a
servant; the Lord who adorned the boundaries of the earth with flowers is the one who is
dishonourably crowned with thorns; the Lord who planted the tree of life in Paradise is
the one who is hanged upon an accursed tree. O great and more then natural sights! The sun
saw them and faded, the moon saw them and was darkened, the earth perceived them was
shaken, the rocks perceived them and were rent, all creation was turned back at the
outrages done to the Master. The lifeless elements which have no senses, as if endowed
with life and sensation from fear of the Lord and from the spectacle of what is seen, were
amazed and altered; and do we, who have been honoured with reason, for whose sake Christ
died, remain untouched and unweeping in these days? How could we be less rational than
things which have no reason, more unfeeling than the stones? In no way, my brothers, in no
way. Let us rather be amazed in a manner worthy of God, by being changed with a fair
change; let us draw down tears, sacrifice the passions, changing insults for insults and
exchanging wounds for wounds, the one through obedience, the other through unflinching
confession. Do we not see the burning incitements of divine love? Who ever dwelt in prison
for a friend? Who accepted slaughter for their beloved? But our good God not only did the
one and both of them, but accepted ten thousand sufferings for the sake of us, the
condemned. Fittingly then the blessed Apostle, when he thought on these things and became
powerfully aware of the love of God, said <i>For I am persuaded that neither death nor
life, neither angels nor rules nor powers, neither present nor future, neither height nor
depth, nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ
Jesus our Lord</font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua"> </i>[Rom. 8:38-39]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">. For such was the love God had for us <i>that he gave his
only Son, that all who believe in him might not perish, as it is written, but have eternal
life </i></font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[John 3:16.]</font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua"><i>. </i>As an exchange for this love, the saints, when they had
nothing to offer, offered their own bodies and blood by asceticism and struggle, singing
with blessed David the song: <i>What return may we make to the Lord for all that he has
given to us?</i> </font><font size="3" face="Book Antiqua">[Psalm 115:3.] </font><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Let us also, brethren, cry out these words each day, as we
serve him with an unceasing attitude of love, striving again and again for what is better,
so that we may become heirs with the saints of the eternal blessings in Christ Jesus our
Lord, to whom be glory and might with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever,
and to the ages of ages.</font>&nbsp;
