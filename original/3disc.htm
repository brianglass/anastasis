<p align="center"><font color="#E00557" face="Book Antiqua" size="6">INTRODUCTION</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">These three short discourses belong
together and also to two others on <em>Repentance </em>and on <em>The Coming Judgement. </em>The
style of the third is in places reminiscent of that of the <em>Ladder</em> of St John of
Sinai and in the first there is what looks very like a quotation from the <em>Theotokion </em>that
follows the <em>Eothinon</em> at Lauds on Sundays in the Byzantine office.</font></p>

<hr>

<p align="center"><font color="#E00557" face="Book Antiqua" size="6">ON LOVE</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Rightly did the Lord say, &#145;My burden is
light&#146;. For what sort of weight is it, what sort of toil is it to forgive one&#146;s
brother his offences, which are light and of no importance, and to be pardoned for
one&#146;s own, and immediately justified? He did not say, &#145;Bring me money, or
calves, or goats, or fasting, or vigils&#146;, so that you could say, &#145;I have none, I
cannot&#146;, but he ordered you to bring what is light and easy and immediate, saying,
&#145;Pardon your brother his offences, and I will pardon yours. You pardon small faults,
a few halfpennies, or three pennies, while I give you the ten thousand talents. You only
pardon without giving anything, I nevertheless both grant you pardon and give you healing
and the Kingdom. And I accept your gift, when you are reconciled to the one who is your
enemy, when you have enmity against no one, when the sun does not go down on your anger.
When you have peace and love for all, then your prayer is acceptable, and your offering
well-pleasing, and your house blessed and you blesséd. But if you are not reconciled with
your brother, how can you seek pardon from me? You trample on my words, and do you demand
pardon? I, your Master, demand, and you pay no attention, and do you, a slave, dare to
offer me prayer, or sacrifice, or first fruits, while you have enmity against someone?
Just as you turn your face from your brother, so I too turn my eyes from your gift and
your prayer.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Again I entreat you, brethren, since God is love, he
is not well-pleased by things that take place without love. How would God accept prayer,
or gifts, or first fruits, or offering from a murderer, unless they first repented in
accordance with God&#146;s word? But you will no doubt say to me, &#145;I am not a
murderer.&#146; And I will prove to you that you are, or rather John the Theologian will
convict you, when he says, &#145;Every one who hates their brother is a homicide.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">So then, my beloved brethren, let us not prefer
anything, let us not hasten to obtain anything more than love. Let no one have anything
against anyone, let no one repay evil for evil. Do not let the sun go down on your anger,
but let us forgive our debtors everything and let us welcome love, because love covers a
multitude of sins.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Because what gain is there, my children, if someone
has everything, but does not have love which saves? For just as if someone were to make a
great dinner in order to invite the King and the rulers, and were to prepare everything
sumptuously, so that nothing might be lacking, but had no salt, would anyone be able to
eat that dinner? Certainly not. But he would have lost everything he had spent and wasted
all his hard work, and brought ridicule on himself from those he had invited. So it is in
the present instance. For what advantage is there in toiling against winds, without love?
For without it every deed, every action is unclean. Even if someone has attained complete
chastity, or fasts, or keeps vigil; whether they pray or give banquets for the poor; even
if they think of offering gifts, or first fruits, or offering; whether they build
churches, or do anything else, without love all those things will be reckoned as nothing
by God. For the Lord is not pleased by them. Listen to the Apostle when he says, &#145;If
I speak with the tongues of Angels and of humans; if I have prophecy and know all
mysteries, and have complete knowledge, so as to move mountains, but do not have love, I
gain nothing&#146;. For one who has enmity against their brother and thinks they offer
something to God, will be as though they sacrificed a dog, and their offering will be
reckoned as the wages of prostitution.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Therefore never want to do anything without love,
because love covers a multitude of sins. What good we despise! Of how many good things, of
what joy are we deprived when we have not acquired love! Judas did not wish to acquire it
and went from the midst of the choir of the Apostles, abandoning the true Light, his own
Teacher, and hating his own brothers he walked in darkness. And so Peter, the prince of
the Apostles, said, &#145;Judas transgressed and went to his own place.&#146; And again,
John the Theologian says, &#145;One who hates their brother is in darkness, and walks
about in the dark, and does not know where they is going, because darkness has blinded
their eyes.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">But if you say, &#145;I may not love my brother, but
I love God&#146;, he convicts you when he says, &#145;If someone says, &quot;I love
God&quot; and hates his brother, he is a liar. For someone who does not love his brother
whom he has seen, how can he love God, whom he has not seen?&#146; Therefore one who has
love for his brothers and has no enmity for anyone, who fulfils the word of the Master,
&#145;Do not let the sun go down on your anger&#146;, truly loves God, is a disciple of
Christ who says, &#145;By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love
for one another&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">It is clear then that the disciples of Christ are
recognized by this, by true love. One who has hatred against his brother and thinks he
loves Christ is a liar and deceives himself. For the Apostle John says, &#145;We have this
commandment from him, that one who loves God should love his brother.&#146; And again the
Lord says, &#145;You are to love the Lord your God, and your neighbour as yourself&#146;.
And he adds, wishing to show the power of love, &#145;On these two commandments depend the
whole Law and the Prophets.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">What a remarkable wonder, that one who has unfeigned
love fulfils the whole of the Law. For the fulfilment of the Law is love, as the Apostle
says . O unfathomable power of love! O infinite power of love! Nothing is more precious
than love, neither in heaven nor on earth. That is why the Apostle Paul, having learned
that nothing is worth as much as love, wrote and despatched to the ends of the inhabited
world these words, &#145;Brethren, owe no one anything, except to love one another, to lay
down your lives for one another&#146;. It is love that is the fulfilment of the Law. Love
is unerring salvation. It dwelt from the beginning in Abel&#146;s heart; it was
Noë&#146;s helmsman; it worked with the Patriarchs; rescued Moses; made David the
dwelling of the Holy Spirit; made its tabernacle in the Prophets; gave strength to Job.
And why should I not mention the greatest of all? It brought the Son of God from heaven
down to us. Through love the One without flesh became flesh, the One without time entered
time for us, the Son of God became son of man. Through love all things were ordered for
our salvation; death was destroyed, Hell cast down, Adam recalled and Eve set free.
Through love the curse was abolished, Paradise was opened, life was revealed, the Kingdom
of heaven was promised. Love caught the fishers of fish in its net and made them fishers
of men; competed alongside the Martyrs and gave them strength; turned the deserts into
cities; filled mountains and caves with chanting; made mortals into angels; showed men and
women how to tread the narrow and difficult way. But where should I stop pursuing what
cannot be grasped? Who is capable of recounting the love&#146;s achievements? I think even
the Angels cannot recount them as they deserve.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O blessed love, giver of all good things! O blessed
love, who make those who long for you blessed! Blessed and truly thrice blessed the one
who has acquired love from a pure heart and conscience.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">When you hear about love, you are not to understand
worldly and carnal love, one concerned with taverns and drinking parties, whose belly and
repute is their God, whose love is defined by the table, whose love is hostile to God.
There they invite friends and not enemies, there the poor are not present, there are
laughter, hand clapping and tumults, there drunkenness and disgraceful behaviour. Of this
the Apostle said, &#145;Whoever thinks they are a friend of the world, becomes an enemy of
God.&#146; Of this love [<em>agapi</em>], or rather deception [<em>apati</em>], not to say
more, where God does not visit, God said, &#145;The heathen do the same. For if you love
those who love you, what grace is that to you, or what reward do you have?&#146;</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">We are not speaking of such love, we do not proclaim
it or pursue it, but rather that which is without pretence, without blame, unspotted,
incomparable, which holds all things and whose name is given to every good thing, which
the Lord showed when he said, &#145;That one should lay down one&#146;s life for
one&#146;s friends&#146;. And the Lord himself taught this and did it, and laid down his
life, not only for his friends, but also for his enemies. For &#145;this was how God loved
the world, he gave his only begotten Son&#146; for us. Through this love the Apostle Paul,
who had this divine love, said, &#145;Love does not work evil for one&#146;s neighbour,
does not repay evil for evil, not insult for insult, but is always patient, is kind, is
not jealous, is not provoked, does not reckon up evil, does not rejoice in injustice, but
rejoices with justice. It supports all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
endures all things. Such love as this never fails.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">One who has this is blessed both in the present age
and in the one to come. One who has this blessed love is not proud, not envious, never
hates anyone, does not ignore a pauper, does not turn away a beggar, does not neglect an
orphan, a widow, a stranger. One who has this not only loves those who love them &#151;
for the heathen do this too &#151; but also those who afflict them. Stephen, the first
martyr, because he had this divine love, prayed for those who were stoning him and said,
&#145;Lord, do not hold this sin against them.&#146;</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="4">Again I say, and I will not stop saying,
&#145;Blessed is one who has despised all earthly and perishable things and acquired
love.&#146; Such a person&#146;s reward increases every day. Such a person&#146;s reward
and crown has been prepared, the Kingdom of heaven has been given them. All the Angels
call them blessed; all the Powers of heaven praise them; the choirs of the Archangels
receive them with joy. For them the gates of heaven will be speedily opened, and they will
enter with boldness</font><font size="3"><sup>1</sup></font><font size="4">, take their
stand by the throne of God, be crowned by God&#146;s right hand, and will reign with him
for endless ages.</font></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Who is more blessed than this? Who higher than this?
Who more honoured than this? See to what height love carries those who possess it. Rightly
did the Apostle say that we should owe no one anything, except to love one another. For
&#145;God is love, and one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in them&#146;
to the ages. Amen.</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#E00557" face="Book Antiqua" size="6">ON PSALMODY</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">All this and much more could be said about love. But
let us return to the subject and speak of repentance and the coming judgement. For we
should always meditate on these things, because the day of the Lord is coming like a thief
in the night. Therefore by night and day, look to your last hour and meditate on the law
of the Lord day and night. Say many things to God and few to humans. If you stretch out
your hand to work, let your mouth sing psalms and your mind pray. Let psalmody be
continually on your mouth, for when God is being named he puts the demons to flight and
sanctifies the singer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Psalmody is calm of soul, author of peace. Psalmody
is convenor of friendship, union of the separated, reconciliation of enemies. Psalmody
attracts the help of the Angels, is a weapon in night-time fears, repose of the day&#146;s
toils, safety for infants, adornment for the old, consolation for the elderly, most
fitting embellishment for women. It make deserts into homes, market places sober. It is
the ABC for beginners, progress for the more advanced, confirmation for the perfect, the
voice of the Church. It makes festivals radiant; it creates mourning that is in accordance
with God, for psalmody draws tears even from a heart of stone. Psalmody is the work of the
Angels, the commonwealth of heaven, spiritual incense. Psalmody is enlightenment of souls,
sanctification of bodies.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Let us, brethren, never stop making psalmody our
meditation, both at home and on the road, both sleeping and waking, speaking to ourselves
in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Psalmody is the joy of those who love God. It
banishes idle chatter, brings laughter to an end, reminds us of the judgement, rouses the
soul towards God, joins the choir of the Angels. Where there is psalmody with compunction,
there God is, with the Angels. Where the songs of the opponent are, there is God&#146;s
wrath, and &#145;woe!&#146; is the reward of laughter. Where sacred books and readings
are, there are the joy of the just and the salvation of the listeners. Where there are
harps and dances, there is the darkening of men and women, and a festival of the Devil.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">O the wicked cunning and contrivance of the Devil!
How he trips each one through craft, and deceives them and persuades them to do evil as
though it were good! Today they decide to chant, tomorrow they dance with enthusiasm.
Today they are Christians, tomorrow heathens. Today of good repute, tomorrow pagans. Today
servants of Christ, tomorrow rebels against God. Do not be deceived. No one can be servant
of two lords, as it is written. You cannot serve God and dance with the Devil.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">As true servants of Christ, let us serve him, let us
worship him, let us devote ourselves to him, let us stay by him until our last breath, and
let us not obey the Devil, for he goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may
swallow up, whom he may deceive. Resist him stoutly, as soldiers of Christ, serving him
and staying by him. Do not chant today and dance tomorrow. Do not repent today for your
sins and tomorrow dance for your destruction. Do not read today and play the harp
tomorrow. Do not be master of yourself today and come forward tomorrow reeling and dizzy
and the laughing stock of all.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua"><font size="4">Do not, brethren, let us lose like this the
moment of our salvation, by playing about and being played about with. Be like a good
farmer, working and taking care. My brother, do not make light of the provisions for
eternal life. Do not reject fasting</font><font size="3"><sup>2</sup></font><font size="4">,
do not desert vigil, do not be despondent about sleeping on the ground, do not abandon
psalmody. For these things and things like them escort you to life and joy and gladness
and eternal repose. Love silence rather than wicked conversation. Conversations about
worldly things separate the mind from God.</font></font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#E00557" size="6" face="Book Antiqua">ON PRAYER</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Not to sin is truly blessed; but those who sin
should not despair, but grieve over the sins they have committed, so that, through grief
they may again attain blessedness. It is good, then, to pray always and not to lose heart,
as the Lord says, And again the Apostle says, &#145;Pray without ceasing&#146;, that is by
night and by day and at every hour, and not only when coming into the church, and not
bothering at other times. But whether you are working, lying down to sleep, travelling,
eating, drinking, sitting at table, do not interrupt your prayer, for you do not know when
he who demands your soul is coming. Don&#146;t wait for Sunday or a feast day, or a
different place, but, as the Prophet David says, &#145;in every place of his
dominion&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Whether you are in church, or in your house, or in
the country; whether you are guarding sheep, or constructing buildings, or present at
drinking parties, do not stop praying. When you are able, bend your knees, when you
cannot, make intercession in your mind, &#145;at evening and at morning and at
midday&#146;. If prayer precedes your work and if, when you rise from your bed, your first
movements are accompanied by prayer, sin can find no entrance to attack your soul.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Prayer is a guard of prudence, control of wrath,
restraint of pride, cleansing of malice, destruction of envy, righting of impiety. Prayer
is strength of bodies, prosperity of a household, good order of a city, might of a
kingdom, trophy of war, assurance of peace. Prayer is a seal of virginity, fidelity in
marriage, weapon of travellers, guardian of sleepers, courage of the wakeful, abundance
for farmers, safety of those who sail. Prayer is an advocate for those being judged,
remission for the bound, consolation for the grieving, gladness for the joyful, comfort
for mourners, a feast on birthdays, a crown for the married, a shroud for the dying.
Prayer is converse with God, equal honour with the Angels, progress in good things,
averting of evils, righting of sinners. Prayer made the whale a house for Jonas, brought
Ezechias back to life from the gates of death, turned the flame to wind of moisture for
the Youths in Babylon. Through prayer Elias bound the heaven not to rain for three years
and six months.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">See, brethren, what strength prayer has. There is no
possession more precious than prayer in the whole of human life. Never be parted from it;
never abandon it. But, as our Lord said, let us pray that out toil may not be for nothing,
&#145;When you stand in prayer, forgive if you have anything against anyone, that your
heavenly Father may forgive you your faults&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">Do you not see, brethren, that we toil for nothing
when we pray, if we have enmity against someone? And again the Lord says, &#145;If you
offer your gift at the altar, and there you remember that someone has something against
you, leave your gift before the altar, and go first and be reconciled to your brother, and
then come and offer your gift&#146;. Therefore, it is clear that if you do not do this
first, all that you offer will be unacceptable, but if you do the Master&#146;s bidding,
then implore the Lord with boldness, saying, &#145;Forgive me my debts, Master, as I have
forgiven my brother, so fulfilling your commandment. I, weak though I am, have
forgiven&#146;. For the Lover of mankind will answer, &#145;If you have forgiven, I too
will forgive. If you have pardoned, I too will pardon your sins. For I have authority on
earth to forgive sins. Forgive and you will be forgiven&#146;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Book Antiqua">See God&#146;s unfathomable love for humankind. See
God&#146;s unbounded goodness. Hear instant salvation of your souls.</font></p>
