<p>Fearful it is, O Word of God, to see you the Maker destroyed on a Tree, suffering in
the flesh, God on behalf of slaves, and lying lifeless in a grave, but releasing the dead
from Hell. Therefore, O Christ, as all-powerful we magnify you.</p>

<p>By being placed as a corpse in a tomb, O Christ, you saved the Forefathers from the
corruption of death, and you made life blossom by rising from the dead, leading mortal
nature to the light and clothing it with divine incorruption. Therefore as source of
ever-living light we magnify you.</font></p>

<p>You were revealed, All-pure, as Temple and throne of God, in which he who lives in the
highest took his dwelling, born without man, and in no way opening the gates of your
flesh. Therefore by your unceasing prayers, O Holy One, finally defeat the tribes of
barbarians and subject them to our King.</font></p>

<p>You have became a source of glory for mortals by a dishonourable death, which you
tasted, Christ Saviour, through crucifixion in your mortal nature, and you granted me
incorruption, for you love mankind.</p>

<p>By rising from the tomb, O Christ, you saved me and exalted me and brought me to the
Father, your Begetter, and you took your seat at his right hand through the compassion of
your mercy, O Lord.</font></p>

<p>For the devout faithful, O Virgin, there is no surfeit of your praises at all; for
receiving divine and spiritual love, as Mother of God with love they magnify you.</p>

<p>You have placed the one who bore you, O Christ, as an intercessor for us, who can never
be put to shame. At her entreaties, O Merciful, you distribute to us the Spirit who gives
freely of his goodness, who proceeds through you from the Father.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Come all you nations, acknowledge the power of the dread mystery; for Christ our
Saviour, the Word in the beginning, was crucified for us and willingly buried and rose
from the dead to save the whole universe. Let us worship him.</p>

<p>Your guards recounted all the marvels, Lord, but, by filling their right hand with
gifts, the Sanhedrin of folly thought to conceal your Resurrection, which the world
glorifies. Have mercy on us.</p>

<p>All things have been filled with joy on receiving proof of the Resurrection. For Mary
Magdalen came to the grave, found an Angel seated on the stone and dazzling in shining
raiment, who said, &#145;Why do you seek the living with the dead? He is not here, but he
has risen, as he said, and goes before you into Galilee.&#146;</p>

<p>In your light, O Master who love mankind, we shall see light. For you rose from the
dead, granting salvation to the human race, that all creation may glorify you, the only
sinless one. Have mercy on us.</font></p>

<p>As a morning hymn, Lord, the Myrrhbearing Women offered you their tears. For bringing
perfumes of sweet fragrance, they came to your grave, eager to anoint your most pure Body.
An angel seated on the stone gave them the good tidings, &#145;Why do you seek the living
with the dead? For he has trampled on death and has risen as God, granting to all his
great mercy.&#146;</p>

<p>A dazzling Angel by your life-giving grave said to the Myrrh-bearers, &#145;The
Redeemer has emptied the tombs, he has despoiled Hell and risen on the third day as alone
God and all-powerful.&#146;</p>

<p>On the first day of the week Mary Magdalen came to the grave and sought you. When she
did not find you, she lamented and cried out with grief, &#145;Alas, my Saviour, how have
you, the King of all, been stolen?&#146; But a pair of life-bearing Angels from within the
grave cried out, &#145;Why do you weep, woman?&#146; &#145;I weep&#146;, she said,
&#145;because they have taken my Lord from the tomb and I do not know where they have laid
him&#146;. But when, turning back, she saw you, at once she cried out, &#145;My Lord and
my God, glory to you!&#146;</p>

<p>The Hebrews shut Life up in the tomb; but the Thief opened the Paradise of pleasure
with his voice when he cried and said, &#145;The One who was crucified with me and who was
hanged with me upon the tree also appears to me seated on the throne together with the
Father. For he is Christ our God, who has great mercy.</p>
