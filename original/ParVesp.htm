Manifest the giving birth, that which was accomplished was beyond nature. O fearsome

been opened again, while all creation as it sings your praise, each evening offers you its
hymn.</p>

<p>I glorify the power of the Father and the Son, and I praise the authority of the Holy

<p>We worship your precious Cross, O Christ, and we praise and glorify your Resurrection,

<p>We praise the Saviour who took flesh from the Virgin; for he was crucified for us and
rose on the third day, granting us his great mercy.</p>

<p>Going down to those in Hades, Christ proclaimed the good tidings, saying, &#145;Be of
good courage; now have I conquered! I am the Resurrection; I will bring you up, abolishing
the gates of death&#146;.</p>

<p>We who stand unworthily in your most pure house sing an evening hymn, as we cry out of
the depths, &#145;Christ God, who enlightened the world by your Resurrection on the third
day, deliver your people from the hand of your foes, O Lover of mankind&#146;.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Compassionate Christ, who fashioned humankind with your immaculate hand, you came to
heal the sick. You raised the Paralytic at the Sheep Pool through your word; you cured the
pain of the woman with the issue of blood; you had pity on the possessed daughter of the
woman of Canaan; and you did not despise the request of the Centurion. Therefore we cry:
All-powerful Lord, glory to you! </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">(Twice)</font></p>

<p>An unburied corpse, the Paralytic, when he saw you, cried out, &#145;Have mercy on me,
Lord, for my bed has become for me a tomb. What does life hold for me? I cannot crave the
Sheep Pool, for I have no one to put me in when the waters are stirred up. But I come to
you, the source of healing, that I may cry with all: All-powerful Lord, glory to
you!&#146;</p>

<p>Jesus went up to Jerusalem, to the Sheep Pool, called by the Jews Bethesda, having five
porches. For in these lay a great multitude of the sick. For an Angel of God would come at
from time to time, stir it up and grant strength to those who approached with faith. And
the Lord, seeing a man who had been sick for many years, said to him, &#145;Do you want to
be made whole?&#146; The sick man answered, &#145;Sir, I have no one to put me into the
pool when the water is stirred up. I have spent all my livelihood on physicians, and it
has not been granted me to find mercy&#146;. But the physician of souls and bodies said to
him, &#145;Take up your bed and walk, while proclaiming my power and my great mercy in the
ends of the earth.&#146;</p>

<p>How should we not marvel at your Offspring, who is both God and man, all-honoured one?
For without knowing man, O all-blameless, you gave birth in the flesh to a Son without
father, begotten from the Father before the ages without mother, in no way undergoing
change, or mixture or separation, but preserving intact the identity of either nature.
Therefore, Sovereign Lady, Virgin Mother, implore him that the souls may be saved of those
who with right belief acknowledge you as Mother of God.</font></p>

<p>A man was lying in sickness at the Sheep Pool, and seeing you, Lord, he cried out,
&#145;I have no one when the water is stirred up to put me in it. While I am moving
forward another gets there before me and receives the healing, while I lie sick&#146;. And
at once the Saviour, moved with compassion, says to him, &#145;For your sake I have become
man, for your sake I have clothed myself in flesh, yet you say &#145;I have no one&#146;?
Take up your bed, and walk!&#146; All things are possible for you, all things obey you,
all things are subject to you; remember us all and have mercy, O Holy One, as you love
humankind.</p>

darkness, for he is the Sun of justice, who wishes to enlighten all those whom he
fashioned according to his own image, by his own hand. Therefore, all-praised One, as you
have a mother&#146;s boldness towards him, intercede with him unceasingly that our souls
may be saved.</font></p>

<p>A sacred Pascha has been shown forth to us to-day, a new and holy Pascha, a mystic
Pascha, an all-venerable Pascha, a Pascha that is Christ the Redeemer, a spotless Pascha,
a great Pascha, a Pascha of the faithful, a Pascha that has opened to us the gates of
Paradise, a Pascha that hallows all the faithful.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>As smoke vanishes, so let them
vanish, as wax melts before the fire.</p>

<p>Come from the scene, O women bearers of good tidings, and say to Zion: Receive from us
the tidings of joy, of the Resurrection of Christ. Exult, dance and be glad, O Jerusalem,
for you have seen Christ the King as a bridegroom come forth from the tomb.</font></p>

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>So let sinners perish at the
presence of God, and let the just be glad.</p>

<p>The Myrrh-bearing women at early dawn came near the tomb of the Giver of life; they
found an Angel sitting on the stone, and he, addressing them in this manner, said: Why do
you seek the living among the dead? Why do you mourn the Incorruptible amid corruption?
Go, proclaim it to his Disciples.</font></p>

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><i> </i>This is the day that the Lord

for us, a Pascha on which let us embrace one another with joy. O Pascha, ransom from
sorrow! To-day Christ has shone forth from the tomb as from a bridal chamber, and has
filled the women with joy, saying: Proclaim it to the Apostles.</p>

<p>In Solomon&#146;s Porch a great crowd of sick was lying, and at the mid-point of the
Feast, Christ, finding a paralytic who had been lying there for thirty eight years, said
to him with the voice of the Master, &#145;Do you want to be made whole?&#146; The sick
man answered him, &#145;Sir, I have no man to put me in the pool when the water is stirred
up&#146;. But he said to him, &#145;Take up your bed. See, you have been made whole. Sin
no more.&#146; At the prayers of the Mother of God, O Lord, send down upon us your great
