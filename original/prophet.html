<p align="CENTER"><h1>AT VESPERS</h1></p>

<p><strong>At</strong> Lord, I have cried<strong>, we
sing Prosomia.</strong></p>

<p align="CENTER">Tone 4. Called from on high.</p>


<p>You revealed your Prophet, O Immortal, as a living cloud, water truly springing up to
eternal life, sending him forth and richly gracing him with the Holy Spirit,
consubstantial with you, almighty Father, and with your Son, who shone forth from your
being; through whom he foretold the saving Coming of Christ our God, and prophesied
salvation to all the nations.</p>

<p>By purity of mind you received the whole brightness of the radiance whose source is
God, and you became a speaker, foreteller and godly interpreter of divine words; you
appeared as the Spirits mouth moved by God, declaring and making clear to all the
nations the things revealed to you through him, all-honoured Prophet, the salvation that
would be given and the kingdom of Christ; implore him to save and enlighten our souls.</p>

<p>Made resplendent by a worthy vision of God, and honoured by prophetic contemplation and
grace, inspired Prophet, you were made worthy of blessedness; using your boldness to him
now, who is all good, and your compassion, do not cease to intercede on behalf of those
who with faith praise you and honour you as revered and inspired and possessed by God,
that our souls may be delivered and saved from dangers.</p>

<p align="CENTER">Glory. Both now.</p>
<strong> Theotokion.
</strong>

<p>As I sail by sea, travel by road, sleep by night, watch over me; give me the grace of a
watchful mind, All-blameless, and grant that I may do the Lords will; that on the
day of sentence I who flee to your protection may find release from all that I have done
in life.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Or Cross-Theotokion.</p>
</strong>

<p>When the Ewe-lamb, your Mother, saw you nailed to the Cross, Lord, she was struck with
amazement, and cried out: What is this sight, my Son so greatly loved? Is this how the
disobedient, lawless people repays your many wonders? But glory, Master, to your ineffable
condescension!</p>


<p align="CENTER"><h2>AT MATINS</h2></p>

<p align="CENTER"><strong>The Canon, of which
the Acrostic is:<br>
</strong>Let the fame of Sophonias give me splendour.<br>
<strong>By Theophanes.</strong></p>

<p align="center">Ode 1. Tone 6. Irmos.As Israel marched on foot.</p>

<p align="left">[As Israel marched on foot in the deep
as on dry land and watched Pharao the pursuer drowning, they cried out: To God let us sing
a song of victory.]</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Troparia.</p>
</strong>

<p>We beg you, Prophet of God, who stand by his judgement seat, to intercede insistently
that enlightenment be given to us who hymn with faith your honoured memory.</p>

<p>You were revealed as a godlike instrument containing the illuminations of the Spirit of
God, and enjoying his gifts; and so we the faithful, rejoicing, call you blessed.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Theotokion.</p>
</strong>

<p>The Sun which shone from your womb with shining rays makes the whole earth bright,
Sovereign Lady; enlightened by them we honour you as Mother of God.</p>
<strong>

<p align="center">Ode 3. Irmos. None is holy.</p>


</strong><p align="left">[None is Holy but you, O Lord my God,
who have exalted the horn of your faithful people and established me, O Good One, on the
rock of confession of you.]</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Troparia.</p>
</strong>

<p>He who as God sees all things shows and reveals to you, wise Prophet, in a manner
fitting God the knowledge of things to come, and the clear understanding of those which
will come to pass, O blessed and worthy of praise.</p>

<p>Having with devout boldness slain your mind, blest Prophet, you submitted yourself to
the Spirit of God, and became the recipient of the divine rays that come from there.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Theotokion.</p>
</strong>

<p>Behold, with faith all generations call you blessed, who in time gave birth beyond
nature in the body to the Word without time, and remained still a Virgin.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Irmos.</p>
</strong>

<p>None is Holy but you, O Lord my God, who have exalted the horn of your faithful people
and established me, O Good One, on the rock of confession of you.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Kathisma. Tone 1. Soldiers watching.</p>
</strong>

<p>The august prophet, having gained by divine rays a mind formed of light, foretells what
is to come, speaking by the all-holy Spirit; today as with devout mind we honour him, let
us celebrate his sacred memory with uprightness of heart.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Theotokion.</p>
</strong>

<p>Hope of Christians, all-holy Virgin, with the Powers above, implore without ceasing the
God to whom you gave birth beyond nature and reason, to grant forgiveness of sins and
amendment of life to us all who ever glorify you with faith and love.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Or Cross-Theotokion.</p>
</strong>

<p>The spotless Ewe-lamb, when she saw the Lamb and Shepherd hanging dead upon the Tree,
cried in lamentation and bewailed him as a mother: How may I bear, my Son, your
condescension beyond reason and your voluntary sufferings, O God supremely good?</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Ode 4. Irmos. Christ is my power.</p>
</strong>

<p>[Christ is my power, my God and Lord, the holy Church cries out from a pure mind in
song befitting God, as it keeps festival in the Lord.]</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Troparia.</p>
</strong>

<p>The Lord of all things has appeared to us, blest Prophet, in accordance with your
prophecy, summoning all things to knowledge of himself, and has freed them from slavery.</p>

<p>Made radiant by grace, you prophesied saying that those who worship should come under
one yoke, being brought to the faith and adoring the Lord.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Theotokion.</p>
</strong>

<p>Mary, All-pure, scatter the flood of passions of my mind and the storm of temptations,
as the one who gave birth to the source of dispassion, O Virgin Mother.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Ode 5. Irmos. With your divine radiance.</p>
</strong>

<p>[With your divine radiance, O Good One, illumine, I beg, the souls of those who rise to
you at dawn with love to know you, Word of God, to be truly God, calling them back from
the gloom of offences.]</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Troparia.</p>
</strong>

<p>Turn me from unrighteousness to virtue, from the captivity of the passions, blessed,
glorious Prophet, by your intercessions, and direct my works to the light of true
religion.</p>

<p>You made your soul resplendent with the rays of the virtues, and showed it to be ready
for the beams of the divine Spirit; from whom you were also enriched with the grace of
prophecy.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Theotokion.</p>
</strong>

<p>Prophetic sayings, All-holy Virgin, announce through symbols your child-bearing; we,
who now see their fulfilment, proclaim you to be in truth Mother of God.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Ode 6. Irmos. Watching lifes sea.</p>
</strong>

<p>[Watching lifes sea rising with a tempest of temptations, fleeing to your calm
haven, I cry out to you: Bring my life up from corruption, O Most Merciful.]</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Troparia.</p>
</strong>

<p>Receiving the beams of the Spirit, glorious Prophet, as a clear mirror you blazed forth
the rays of inspired prophecy to the world, foretelling things to come as things present.</p>

<p>Your King has come; Sion rejoice and exult at seeing him; he has enlightened the world
with the beams of his Godhead and destroyed the error of demons.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Theotokion.</p>
</strong>

<p>United to the solidity of flesh in your womb, the Only-Begotten of the Father came
forth, one from two, without corruption, and kept your virginity unharmed, O All-praised.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Irmos.</p>
</strong>

<p>Watching lifes sea rising with a tempest of temptations, fleeing to your calm
haven, I cry out to you: Bring my life up from corruption, O Most Merciful.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Ode 7. Irmos.An Angel made the furnace moist with dew.</p>
</strong>

<p>[An Angel made the furnace moist with dew for the godly Youths, while Gods
command consuming the Chaldeans persuaded the tyrant to cry out: Blessed are you, God of
our Fathers.]</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Troparia.</p>
</strong>

<p>Your memory, inspired Prophet, has dawned for the world like a sun, making radiant with
the grace of your Prophecy those who with faith harmoniously sing to Christ: Blessed are
you, the God of our Fathers.</p>

<p>Revealed as more abundant than a cloud, blest prophet, you sent forth for us a shower
of saving knowledge of God from sources through which we are enlightened to cry out:
Blessed are you, the God of our Fathers.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Theotokion.</p>
</strong>

<p>The Word, who of old gave being to all things by his divine will, Pure Virgin, willing
to call back humanity, made his dwelling in your womb, O Blessed One, who bore God in the
flesh.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Ode 8. Irmos. From the flame.</p>
</strong>

<p>[From flame you made a source of dew for the Saints, and with water you consumed the
sacrifice of a righteous man with flame. For you do all things, O Christ, simply by
willing them. We highly exalt you to all the ages.]</p>

<p>Giving yourself wholly to the Almighty, you were initiated into the ways of providence,
which train the Nations in accordance with the Dispensation; therefore we sing your
praise, inspired Prophet.</p>

<p>Offer to God a hymn of supplication, Blessed of God, on behalf of us who hymn you, and
free us now from the tempest of temptations, that we may sing your praise, inspired
Prophet.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Theotokion.</p>
</strong>

<p>By giving birth to the Giver of life, God and Lord, you put an end to the destruction
of death, which had slain all, Pure Virgin; therefore we sing your praise to all the ages.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Irmos.</p>
</strong>

<p>From flame you made a source of dew for the Saints, and with water you consumed the
sacrifice of a righteous man with flame. For you do all things, O Christ, simply by
willing them. We highly exalt you to all the ages.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Ode 9. Irmos. It is impossible.</p>
</strong>

<p>[It is impossible for humans to see God, on whom the ranks of Angels dare not gaze. But
through you, O All-pure, the incarnate Word has been seen by mortals. As we magnify him,
with the heavenly armies we call you blessed.]</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Troparia.</p>
</strong>

<p>In the land of the meek you have made your dwelling, where you see the splendours of
many Angels, all-wise Prophet, servant of God, having become meek and resplendent with
grace; therefore we faithful, rejoicing, call you blessed.</p>

<p>Seeing the clear fulfilment of your prophecies, O all-revered, we marvel at the grace
which was given you, and are amazed at the purity of your mind and the godliness of your
soul.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Theotokion.</p>
</strong>

<p>None from ancient generations was ever graced as you, all-immaculate Mother of God; for
you alone of all women possess incomparable holiness; therefore you received in yourself
God incarnate.</p>
<strong>

<p align="CENTER">Irmos.</p>
</strong>

<p>It is impossible for humans to see God, on whom the ranks of Angels dare not gaze. But
through you, O All-pure, the incarnate Word has been seen by mortals. As we magnify him,
with the heavenly armies we call you blessed.</p>
