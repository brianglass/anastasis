<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>You revealed your Prophet, O Immortal, as a living cloud, water truly springing up to
eternal life, sending him forth and richly gracing him with the Holy Spirit,
consubstantial with you, almighty Father, and with your Son, who shone forth from your
being; through whom he foretold the saving Coming of Christ our God, and prophesied
salvation to all the nations.</p>

<p>By purity of mind you received the whole brightness of the radiance whose source is
God, and you became a speaker, foreteller and godly interpreter of divine words; you
appeared as the Spirit&#146;s mouth moved by God, declaring and making clear to all the
nations the things revealed to you through him, all-honoured Prophet, the salvation that
would be given and the kingdom of Christ; implore him to save and enlighten our souls.</p>

<p>Made resplendent by a worthy vision of God, and honoured by prophetic contemplation and
grace, inspired Prophet, you were made worthy of blessedness; using your boldness to him
now, who is all good, and your compassion, do not cease to intercede on behalf of those
who with faith praise you and honour you as revered and inspired and possessed by God,
that our souls may be delivered and saved from dangers.</p>

in life.</font></p>
