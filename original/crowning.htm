<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>God most pure, Author of all creation, through your love for mankind you transformed
the rib of our forefather Adam into a woman and blessed them saying, &#145;Increase and
multiply and have dominion over the earth&#146;, and declared them both to be one through
wedlock, &#145;for because of this a man will abandon his father and mother and be
attached to his own wife, and the two shall become one flesh&#146; and &#145;those whom
God has joined together, let no human separate&#146;.<br>
You blessed your servant Abraham and opened Sara&#146;s womb, making him the father of
many nations.<br>
You gave Isaac to Rebecca and blessed her offspring.<br>
You joined Jacob with Rachel and from him revealed the Twelve Patriarchs.<br>
You yoked together Joseph and Aseneth and gave them as the fruit of their union Ephraim
and Manassee.<br>
You accepted Zachary and Elisabeth and declared their offspring to be the Forerunner.<br>
You made the Ever-Virgin spring from the root of Jesse according to the flesh, and from
her you became incarnate and were born for the salvation of the human race.<br>
Through your ineffable gift and great goodness you were present in Cana of Galilee and
blessed the marriage there, to show that lawful wedlock and the begetting of children that
comes from it is your will.</p>

<p>All-holy Master, accept the entreaty of us, your suppliants, and, as you were present
there, be present here also with your invisible protection.</p>

<p>Bless this marriage and grant to these servants of yours, </font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4" color="#ff0000">N</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">.

other in the bond of peace, long-lived offspring, grace in their children and an unfading
crown of glory.<br>
Grant that they may see their children&#146;s children.<br>
Preserve their marriage bed unassailed.<br>
Give them of the dew of heaven from on high and of the richness of the earth.<br>
Fill their houses with wheat, wine and oil and every good thing, so that they may also
share them with those in need.</p>

<p>Grant also to those here with them all their requests that are for salvation. Because
you are a God of mercy and compassion and love for humankind, and to you we give glory,
together with your Father who has no beginning, and your all-holy, good and life-giving
Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Blessed are you, Lord our God, sacred Celebrant of the mystical and most pure marriage,
Lawgiver of bodily marriage, Guardian of incorruption, loving Steward of our livelihood.
In the beginning, Master, you fashioned man and established him as king of creation, and
said, &#145;It is not good for man to be alone on the earth. Let us make him a helper like
himself.&#146; And taking one of his ribs you fashioned a woman. When Adam saw her he
said, &#145;Now this is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh. She will be called
&#145;woman&#146; because she was taken from her man. For this reason a man will leave
behind his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one
flesh&#146;. And &#145;Those whom God has joined together, let no human separate&#146;.
Now, Master, Lord our God, send down your heavenly grace also on these servants of yours, </font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4" color="#ff0000">N</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">.
and </font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4" color="#ff0000">M</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">., and grant that this handmaid of yours may be subject in
all things to her husband and that this servant of yours may be the head of his wife, so
that they may live in accordance with your will.</p>

<p>Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Abraham and Sara.<br>
Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Isaac and Rebecca.<br>
Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Jacob and all the Patriarchs.<br>
Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Joseph and Aseneth. Bless them, Lord our God, as
you blessed Moses and Sepphora. Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Joachim and Anna.<br>
Bless them, Lord our God, as you blessed Zachary and Elisabeth.</p>

<p>Preserve them, Lord our God, as you preserved Noë in the Ark. Preserve them, Lord our
God, as you preserved Jonas in the belly of the whale.<br>
Preserve them, Lord our God, as you preserved the three holy Youths from the fire, by
sending down on them dew from heaven.</p>

<p>And let the joy come upon them that the blessed Helen had when she found the precious
Cross.</p>

<p>Remember them, Lord our God, as you remembered Enoch, Sem and Elias.<br>
Remember them, Lord our God, as you remembered the holy Forty Martyrs, sending down on
them crowns from heaven.<br>
Remember also, Lord our God, the parents who have brought them up, for the prayers of
parents make firm the foundations of households.<br>
Remember, Lord our God, your servants the groomsmen and bridesmaids, who have come
together to share this joy.<br>
Remember, Lord our God, your servant </font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4" color="#ff0000">N</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">. and your servant </font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="4" color="#ff0000">M</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">.,

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
Give them the fruit of the womb, fair offspring, concord of soul and body.<br>
Exalt them like the cedars of Lebanon, like a well-cultured vine.<br>
Grant then rich harvest, so that, having all sufficiency for themselves, they may overflow
into every good work that is also well-pleasing to you, and that they may see their
children&#146;s children like newly planted olive trees all around their table. And,
having been well pleasing to you, may they shine like beacons in heaven, in you our Lord,

<p>B</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">rethren, give thanks at all times for all
things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, making yourselves subject
to one another in the fear of Christ. Wives be subject to your own husbands as to the
Lord, because the husband is head of the wife, as Christ too is head of the Church, and he
is the Saviour of the body. But as the Church is subject to Christ, so wives must be also
to their own husbands in everything. Husbands love your own wives, as Christ loved the
Church and gave himself for her, that he might sanctify her, having purified her with the
washing of water with a word, that he might present the Church to himself glorious,
without spot or wrinkle or anything similar, but that she might be holy and unblemished.
Thus husbands must love their own wives like their own bodies. One who loves his own wife
loves himself, for no one hates their own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, as the
Lord does the Church, because we are members of his body, from his flesh and from his
bones. &#145;For this reason a man will abandon his father and mother and be attached to
his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.&#146; This is a great mystery, I mean
concerning Christ and the Church. However let each one of you love his wife as himself,
and let the wife respect her husband.</font></p>

<p>A</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">t that time, there was a marriage in Cana of
Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples were also invited to
the marriage. When the wine ran out, Jesus&#146; mother said to him, &#145;They have no
wine&#146;. Jesus said to her. &#145;Woman, why do you trouble me? My hour has not yet
come.&#146; His mother said to the servants, &#145;Whatever he tells you, do it.&#146; Now
there were six stone water jars standing there for the Jewish ritual of purification,
holding twenty or thirty gallons each. Jesus said to the servants, &#145;Fill the jars
with water.&#146; And they filled them to the brim. He said to them, &#145;Now draw some
out, and take it to the chief steward of the feast. They took it. When the chief steward
tasted the water that had become wine and did not know where it had come from &#151; but
the servants who had drawn the water knew &#151; he summoned the bridegroom and said to
him, &#145;Everyone puts out the good wine first, and when people are drunk, then he puts
out the worse. But you have kept the good wine until now.&#146; This was the beginning of
the signs that Jesus did in Cana of Galilee and he manifested his glory and his disciples

Master, Lord our God, who spare all and foresee all, who know the secrets of humans and
have knowledge of all, be merciful to our sins and pardon the offences of your suppliants,
calling them to repentance, granting them pardon of faults, mercy for sins, forgiveness of
offences, voluntary and involuntary. You, our Fashioner and Creator, who know the weakness
of human nature; who pardoned Rahab the harlot and accepted the Publican&#146;s
repentance, do not remember our sins of ignorance since our youth. If you, Lord, should
mark iniquities: O Lord, who will stand? What flesh will be justified in your presence?
For you alone are just, without sin, holy, great in mercy, great in compassion and repent
over the sins of humankind. Do you, Master, who have made your servants, </font>

repentance of the Publican, the tears of the Harlot, the confession of the Thief, so that,
through repentance from their whole heart, practising your commandments in harmony and
peace, they may be found worthy of your heavenly kingdom.</font></p>

Lord Jesus Christ, who were lifted up on the precious and life-giving Cross, tore up
the record against us and delivered us from the dominion of the devil, be merciful to the
iniquities of your servants, because they, unable to bear the heat and burden of the day
and the burning fever of the flesh, are now entering together the communion of a second
marriage, as you made it lawful through the Apostle Paul, your vessel of election, saying
for the sake of us in our lowliness, &#145;It is better to marry in the Lord, than to
burn&#146;. As you are good and love mankind, have mercy, pardon, show pity, remit,
forgive our debts, for you took our sicknesses on your own shoulders, for no one is
sinless or without stain, not even were their life but one day, but you alone, who wore
flesh without sin and granted us eternal dispassion.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">
