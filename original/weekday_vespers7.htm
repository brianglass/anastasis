<p>O Word, who do not desire the death of all, but the repentance of those who 
have sinned against you, most compassionate Christ and Lord, and who ever show 
mercy to me your servant, show me compassion as I repent and dare to ask pardon 
for the wicked deeds through which I have embittered you; for you will show in 
me the depth of your divine pity, if unworthy as I am, you save me as you love 
humankind.</p>
<p>Only lover of humankind, who wish all to be saved, and in compassion call 
those who have grieved you to repentance, do not, I beg, O Master, in any way 
remember the shame of the disordered deeds which I have done, alas! in your 
sight, without trembling, wretch that I am, at your inescapable hand; so now I 
fall before you, groaning and grieving, and in spirit clasping your feet to 
obtain pardon.</p>
<p>Accept my supplication, you who wish all to be saved, and do not cast from 
your presence me the unworthy who have much offended more than every human 
creature from my youth up; therefore with bended knee I fall before you in 
tears: Be compassionate, have mercy, show in me your mercies, O Lord of glory, 
Father of mercy and pities, do not reject me, the wretch who calls on you for 
help.</p>

<p>Build a wall around your flock with protecting Angels, who sustain their 
ranks by your word and will, so driving out every trial from barbarians and 
arrogance of heresies. For you truly purchased this flock of yours by your

the afflictions that now beset it, your flock with orthodox mind may magnify 
you, O Saviour.</p>

<p>From my youth I have been wholly enslaved to the pleasures of the flesh and 
have become a lodging of passions of the soul that tyrannise over me; while with

who fashioned me and know our weakness, who alone are without sin, give me 
pardon, O Compassionate, for the sins I have committed in ignorance and 
knowledge, in body and in mind from my youth, O only loving and most merciful.</p>
<p>Who will deliver me from the death of my miserable flesh and keep my soul 
from hurt and from temptation? For living in enjoyment the flesh holds sway with 
tyrannical force and rises in rebellion against the soul, and it afflicts it 
again and grows weak. Ah, wretch that I am! Therefore, my Saviour, I am unable 
to hold out against its weakness. But, my Maker, do not let my spirit be 
conquered by dust, that spirit which you breathed into as you were well-pleased.</p>
<p>When you wish to separate me from the bonds of the flesh by your command, 
then spare my soul, O Immortal, sending out a gentle Angel, looking like one 
bringing gladness, to take me up and save me from the rulers of darkness, easily 
empowering me to take a fair ascent in the air and to reach the worship of your 
dread throne uncondemned, O God supremely good.</p>

of repentance, and grant me salvation through your godly intercession, O 
Forerunner, as you entreat the Lord.</p>
<p>Wholly condemned by wickedness, wholly drowned by despair, I am utterly evil 
and dark. I am wholly and utterly marked by unseemly pleasures; wholly and 
terribly ruined and ill-treated. I fall at your footprints, blessed John. Do not 
cast me away, but save me, friend and Forerunner of the Lord.</p>
<p>Deliver my soul from the bitter death of sin and faults, O Forerunner, and

<p>In your love for mankind, O Compassionate, raise me up, who have been

<p>Who would not weep for me, who have transgressed my Master’s commandment 
through lack of self-mastery; who dwell in Hades instead of Paradise? Food that 
seemed to me sweet was turned to gall. I have been shown to be a stranger to 
your glory, O Compassionate, and to the Angels. But make me repentant, as you 
are a Lord who is merciful and compassionate because of your great mercy.</p>
<p>Giver of life, set all those who have fallen asleep in faith in the land of 
the living, in places of repose, in eternal dwellings, where the light of your 
face shines out ungrudgingly, where the delight and joy and peace of the 
Righteous are found, overlooking all their faults in deed, word and thought, 
Master, through your great goodness.</p>

<p>Those who bore witness to you, O Christ, endured many torments, and received 
the crown of perfection in heaven, that they might intercede on behalf of our 
souls.</p>
<p>The Martyrs, champions and citizens of heaven, endured many torments as they 
struggled on earth. At their prayers and entreaties, Lord, protect us all.</p>
<p>Your Cross, Lord, became an invincible weapon for the Martyrs. For they saw 
the death that awaited them and looking to the life to come they were empowered 
by their hope in you. At their intercessions have mercy on us.</p>

<p>Who will not call you blessed, All-holy Virgin? Who will not sing the praise 
of your child-birth without labour? For the only-begotten Son, who shone from 
the Father beyond time, came forth from you, pure Maiden, ineffably incarnate. 
By nature he is God, by nature he became man for our sakes, not divided in a 
duality of persons, but known without confusion in a duality of natures. O 
honoured and all-blessed, implore him to have mercy on our souls.</p>

<p>Verse: </font><font FACE="Palatino Linotype" SIZE="4">Blessed are those whom 
you have chosen and taken, O Lord.</p>
<p>Your command, which fashioned me, was my beginning and my substance; for 
wishing to compose me as a living creature from visible and invisible natures, 
you moulded my body from the earth, but gave me a soul by your divine and 
life-giving breath. Therefore, O Christ, give rest to your servant in the land 
of the living, in the tents of the righteous.</p>

<p>Tasting of the tree in Eden of old decreed pain for Adam, when a serpent 
vomited poison, for through it death entered and devoured the whole human race. 
But the Master came, destroyed the dragon and granted us resurrection. To him 
let us cry, ‘Saviour, spare too those whom you have taken, and give them rest 
with the Just’. </p>
