<p>1. The Circumcision according to the flesh of Our Lord Jesus Christ; and commemoration
of our Father among the Saints Basil the Great, archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="BasilCaes01.jpg" width="132" height="175" alt="BasilCaes01.jpg (5992 bytes)"></p>
<font face="Book Antiqua">

<p>Since the law of Moses lays down that if a woman gives birth to a male child it shall
be circumcised in the flesh of its foreskin on the eighth day (Lev. 12:2-3), for this
reason our Saviour on the present day, which is the eighth from his Nativity, accepted the
Circumcision prescribed by the law, and received, in accordance with the Angel&#146;s
command, the name which is above every name, JESUS, that is to say, Saviour (Matt. 1:21,
Lk. 1:31 and 2:21). As we celebrate our Lord&#146;s name day today, from it we begin the
New Year from his incarnation.</p>

<p>Basil the Great was born towards the end of the year 329 in Caesarea of Cappadocia of a
family distinguished both for its culture and sanctity. His parents were called Basil and
Emilia. He studied in Constantinople under the rhetorician Livanios and later in Athens,
where he became the friend of Gregory Nazianzen. He returned to Caesarea, but soon left
for the hesychasteria in the district of Pontus, where his mother and his sister Makrina
were leading the ascetic life. It was then that he wrote his ascetic discourses. Around
370, on the death of the bishop of his home country, he was chosen to succeed to the
throne and entrusted with the Church of Christ, which he shepherded for eight years, and
became a martyr by intent, reckoning nothing to the threats of the Arian emperor Valens,
and of Modestos, prefect of the East. He departed to the Lord on January 1st 379. His
wisdom and great learning, which abound in his writings, through which he taught about God
and made clear the nature of beings, and adorned the morals of mankind, as well as the
magnificence and grandeur of his style have conferred on him the titles of &#145;Revealer
of Heaven&#146; and &#145;Great&#146;.</font></p>

become a model of woman&#146;s nature for the mortification of the flesh and endurance in
afflictions, she died around the middle of the 4th century.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>Near the beginning of Jesus&#146; thirtieth year, John the Forerunner, who was about
the same age (being some six months older than Jesus) and who had lived in the desert
since boyhood, received a command from God and came into the country round the Jordan,
preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. Then Jesus, coming from
Galilee to the Jordan, sought and received baptism, the Master from the slave, at which
these supernatural wonders occurred. The heavens were opened; the Spirit came down on the
baptised in the form of a dove; and a voice was heard from heaven bearing witness that
this is the beloved Son of God, who was then being baptised there as a man (Matt. 3, Lk.
1:26.80 and 3:1-23). From all this was revealed the Divinity of Jesus and the great
mystery of the Trinity; and for this reason the present feast is named Theophany, that is
the Appearing of God among men. From this august day is dated Christian Baptism; from this
day the saving preaching of the Kingdom of heaven began.</font></p>

Churches of Arabia and Palestine, which were contaminated and disrupted by Arianism. Later

was buried by Anthony the Great, who had been guided there by God a few days before his
death. John was a native of Constantinople, the son of distinguished parents, Evtropios
the Senator and Theodora. When he was twelve years old he withdrew secretly and left for
the monastery of the Sleepless (December 29th). But after six years, burning with longing
for his parents, he returned to his family home disguised as a poor beggar (a
&#145;bread-seeker&#146;). He made a little hut by the gate, from which he got the surname
&#145;Kalyvitis&#146; [&#145;Hut-dweller&#146;]. He remained there unrecognised for a long

<p>16. The veneration of the precious Chain of the holy and all-praised Apostle Peter.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>Herod Agrippa, the descendent of Herod the Great (December 25th) and king of the Jews,
raging against the Church of Christ, slaughtered James the brother of John the Evangelist
in Jerusalem in 43. While when he saw that this appeared to please the Jews he arrested
Peter likewise and shut him in prison, guarding him so that, when the feast of the
Passover according to the law was over, he might produce him to the people as a pleasing
victim; but the Apostle, wondrously loosed from his bonds by an Angel, was saved (Acts
12:1-19). These bonds, that is the Chain, with which the Apostle was bound received a
sanctifying and healing grace from the contact with his most sacred body for those who
approach it with faith. They fell into the hands of Christians and were later translated
to Constantinople by the devout Kings and a yearly feast was established for their
veneration for the hallowing of the faithful.</p>

<p>That such things work wonders and many healings holy Scripture is witness when it says
of Paul that the Christians in Ephesus showed him such reverence that taking his
handkerchiefs and aprons with great devotion they cured through them the diseases of the
sick So that when the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to
the sick, their diseases left them (Acts 19:13). And not only the clothing that had in any
case been near their bodies, but even the shadow by itself which fell from them worked the
same cures. And seeing this people would put their sick on beds and stretchers, bring them
and lay on the highways so that as Peter passed even his shadow might fall on one of them
(Acts 5:15), in as much that even if they were not cured, those who brought them with toil
were not content to toil in vain. From this the Orthodox Church learnt the honour and
devotion not only of relics but also of the clothing of holy persons.</font></p>

<p>17. Of our venerable and God-bearing Father Anthony the Great.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>Anthony, the originator of the monastic life, was born in Egypt in 251 of devout
parents. Having heard the voice of the Gospel: If you would be perfect, go, sell all your
goods and give to the poor (Mt. 19:21), he at once put this into practice; and having
distributed all that he possessed to the poor and fled from all the hubbub of the world,
he withdrew into the desert. His many varied temptations there during twenty years without
interruption are beyond belief; his ascetic struggles day and night, through which he slew
the urgings of the passions and reached the summit of dispassion, surpass the bounds of
nature; and the report of his virtuous deeds stirred such a multitude to imitate him that
the desert was transformed into a city, with him as governor, lawgiver and trainer of all
the citizens of this newest city. But the cities of the world also enjoyed the fruit of
his virtue. When the Christians were being persecuted and put to death under Maximinus in
312 he hurried to their help and comfort. When the Church was disturbed by the Arians he
came down with zeal to Alexandria in 335 and struggled against them on behalf of
Orthodoxy; and he turned many back to Christ through the grace of his own words. When he
had thus lived his life and become a model of virtue and a rule for monks, he died on the
17th of January in 356, having lived for 104 years.</font></p>

<p>18. Of our Fathers among the saints and archbishops of Alexandria, Athanasios and
Cyril.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>These two wise Teachers of the truth and champions of Christ&#146;s Church were natives
of Alexandria. Athanasios was born, as some maintain, in 296. While still a deacon he was
present at the 1st Ecumenical Council in Nicea of the 318 holy Fathers, which was summoned
in 325 against Arius, at which he excelled all through his zeal and the teaching of the
Consubstantial. The next year, 326, having succeeded Alexander the bishop of Alexandria,
he refused communion to Arius, knowing the tergiversation of his opinion and that the
disease of heresy was still lurking in his heart. From then on began the accusations and
attacks against him by the heresiarch&#146;s followers; from then on began their
robbers&#146; plots against him and the unjust decrees against him and the constant exiles
by the Emperors, Constantine the Great, Constantius his son, Julian the Apostate and the
fervent champion of the Arians Valens, the first because of his trust in the accusations
of others, the rest motivated by their own bad faith. The champion of Orthodoxy, at one
time compelled by the force of those who held power, at others yielding to the rage of his
enemies, was exiled to Trier in Gaul, fled to Rome, went far away by fleeing to the
deserts, was hidden in cellars for months on end, endured ten thousand dangers and
persecutions for 46 years; during which he was recalled for a time, but shortly chased out
again. Finally he appeared again on his high throne like a shining, but evening, star, and
having illumined the orthodox people by the splendour of his words for a short time, he
declined towards the setting of his life and died, the much-enduring, from his many toils
in 373.</p>

<p>Cyril was Theophilos&#146;s nephew, son of his mother&#146;s brother, the bishop of
Alexandria, by whom he was taught from his youth. After he had spent a considerable time
living with the monks of Nitria he later succeeded his uncle in 412. Driven from his
throne through the machinations of the Nestorians, he recovered it not long after. He was
present at the 3rd Ecumenical Council of the 200 Fathers in 431 under Theodosios the Less
which met at Ephesus, of which he was the leader, and through his most wise words he put
to shame Nestorius who blasphemed against the Mother of God and refuted his impious
doctrine. He shepherded Christ&#146;s Church for 32 years and died in 444.</p>

<p>Both left behind many wise writings, explanations of the holy Scriptures, doctrinal
works on the faith of Christ, demonstrations of the truth and refutations of the error of
heresies.</font></p>

<p>19. Of our venerable Father Makarios the Egyptian; and of our Father among the Saints
Arsenios of Kekyra.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>Of these, St Makarios was from the Egyptian Thebaid, a disciple, according to some of
Anthony the Great. He was born around the year 301. He lived the ascetic life at Skete in
the desert. Through his extreme wisdom and his severity of life while still a youth he was
called Boy-elder. He was ordained priest. He lived for 90 years and died in 391. Under his
name are preserved 50 homilies; some say that Anthony the Great wrote them in Syriac and
that Makarios translated them into Greek.</p>

<p>Arsenios was a native of Palestine, son of god-loving parents. He was dedicated to God
from his youth and was took the monastic schema. He studied in Selefkia, where he was also
ordained priest. From there he moved to Constantinople and was ordained as bishop of
Kekyra; whose throne he adorned through his virtue and education. He returned to
Constantinople when he was an old man and calmed the anger of the emperor Constantine
Porphyrogenitos against the leaders of Kekyra. Finally, as he was returning to his see, he
was taken ill at Corinth and reposed in the Lord around the end of the 8th century.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>He was from Melitini in Armenia, son of devout parents, Paul and Dionysia. He was born
around 377. His mother had previously been barren and he was named Efthymios because of
his parents desire and their joy at his birth. He studied under Evtroïos, the bishop of
Melitini, by whom he was ordained priest and entrusted with the care of the monasteries in
Melitini. Then he left for Palestine where he was established as leader of a great
multitude of monks. He brought back to true religion many of the Saracens and warred
against the Nestorians, Eftychians and Manicheans. He corrected Evdokia, queen consort of
Theodosios the Less, who had fallen into the heresy of the Monophysites. He became the
oracle of the Eastern Church, as one of the historians has written. He lived for 96 years
and died in 473 on the 20th of January.</font></p>

<p>The martyr was from Nicea in Bithynia, son of devout parents, Theodore and Florence; he
was martyred under Diocletian in 200.</p>

<p>The godlike Maximos was a native of Constantinople of a most distinguished family, a
philosopher and outstanding theologian. To begin with he was appointed private secretary
to the emperor Herakleios and his son Constans; but because the royal court was dominated
by the monothelite heresy, which he hated, he left for the monastery of Chrysopolis
(Scutari), of which he later became abbot. He was required by Constans either to accept
the monothelite doctrine or to cease speaking and writing against them. As he was not
prepared to do either his tongue and right hand were cut off and he was sent into exile,
where he died in 662. Some historians say nothing of the amputation of his tongue and
hand.</font></p>

<p>22. Of the holy Apostle Timothy; and of the Monk and Martyr Anastasios the Persian.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua">

<p>The Apostle was from Lystra in Lykaonia, born of a Greek [pagan] father and a Jewish
mother. He became a disciple of the Apostle Paul, when he first preached there, and he
followed him throughout the whole time of his preaching. He was ordained by him as first
bishop of the church of Ephesus. After shepherding it under the direction of John the
Evangelist, who governed all the churches in [the Roman province of] Asia, he met a
martyr&#146;s end in the year 97, being stoned be the pagans, because he wished, as some
thought, to oppose the feast of Artemis who was worshipped by them.</p>

<p>Anastasios was a Persian by race. When he saw the implacable hatred of Chorsoes II for
the Christians he was at a loss as to its reason and wished to learn the teaching of their
faith in depth. And when he had been taught it, he was amazed, came to love it greatly and
embraced it. He was baptized in Palestine and, having changed his name, which had
previously been Magoudat, to Anastasios, he lived as a monk for a considerable time in the
monasteries there. When Chosroes made that fearful expedition of his against Palestine, in
the course of which he gained control of Jerusalem, burned down all the churches,
slaughtered all the clergy and sold the people he had taken prisoner, who numbered, so
they recount, 90,000, to the Jews and carried off all the sacred vessels and the precious
wood of the Cross itself to Persia, it was then that Anastasios too, who confessed Christ
boldly, was beheaded after many and terrible tortures on the 22nd of January in the year
614.</font></p>

time of his sufferings and struggles was drawn out to 28 years. Finally he was beheaded
along with Agathangelos under Diocletian and Maximianos in 296. [In Greek a

<p>This great Father and Teacher of the Church was born in Areianzos, a village of
Cappadocia Secunda, not far from Nazianzus. His father, who was called Gregory, later
became bishop of Nazianzus. His mother was Nonna. He was educated to begin with at
Caesarea in Palestine, after this in Alexandria and finally in Athens, where he became the
fast friend of Basil the Great, with whom he practised the ascetic life and lived with him
for some time in the hermitages of Pontus. He was ordained as presbyter of the church of
Nazianzus by his own father, while by Basil the Great he was appointed bishop of Sasima,
or Zasima, which was subject to the bishop of Caesarea. In about 378 he left to assist the
Church of Constantinople, which had already been troubled for forty years by the Arians,
and when through his very wise sermons and many toils he had freed it from the outrage of
heresies, he was elected its bishop by the second Ecumenical Synod that had then been
assembled there, at which he was conspicuous through his theological doctrines. He
governed the church there until 382, then, after delivering his Syntaktirion, that is his
farewell address, before the 150 bishops and the Emperor himself, he returned to

<p>He was a native of Constantinople, a wealthy and noble man, and one who breathed true

wife Mary and they went off to visit his sons. When they found them in Jerusalem clothed
in the monastic habit, they did the same themselves. And so, when they had devoutly
