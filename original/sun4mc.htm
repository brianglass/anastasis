<p>As they looked at the entrance of the tomb and were unable to endure the bright flame
of the Angel, the Myrrhbearing women trembled with amazement and said, &#145;Can the One
who opened Paradise to the Thief have been stolen? Can he who before his passion

life and resurrection&#146;.</font></p>

<p>Of your own will, O Saviour, you endured the Cross, and mortals laid in a new tomb the

<p>All the choirs of Angels were struck with wonder, Pure Virgin, at the dread mystery of
your conceiving; how the One who holds all things fast with only a nod, is held fast in
your arms as a mortal; how the Eternal accepts a beginning; how the One who nourishes
everything that breathes by his ineffable goodness, is suckled at the breast: and with
hymns they glorify you as truly Mother of God.</font></p>

<p>You were lifted up, setting aright our fall by the immaculate tree of the Cross and
healing the total destruction wrought by a tree, O Master, as you are loving and all

<p>With your body, O Christ, you were in the tomb, with your soul in Hell as God, in
Paradise with the Thief, on the throne with the Father and the Spirit, filling all things,
yet yourself uncircumscribed.</font></p>

<p>You healed the fracture of humanity, Lord, which you restored by your precious Blood,

done away with when it encountered eternal Life, the Master of all things, God incarnate.</font></p>

remained a treasure of virginity.</font></p>

<p>All-powerful Lord, who endured Cross and death, and rose from the dead, we glorify your
Resurrection.</p>

<p>By your Cross, O Christ, you have freed us from the ancient curse, and by your death
you have destroyed the devil who tyrannised over our nature, by your Rising you have
filled all things with joy; therefore we cry to you: Lord risen from the dead, glory to
you!</p>

<p>With your Cross, Christ Saviour, guide us to your truth, and deliver us from the snares
of the foe; risen from the dead raise us who have fallen through sin by stretching out
your hand, Lord, at the prayers of your Saints.</p>

<p>Only-begotten Word of God, without being parted from the Father's bosom, you came on
earth through love for mankind, becoming man without change, and though impassible in your
Godhead, you endured Cross and death in the flesh; but risen from the dead you granted the
human race immortality, as you alone are all-powerful.</font></p>

<p>You accepted death in the flesh, so ensuring us immortality; and you dwelt in a tomb,
that you might free us from Hell, raising us with yourself, having suffered as a man, but
rising as God. Therefore we cry to you: Glory to you, life-giving Lord, only lover of
mankind.</p>

<p>The rocks were rent, O Saviour, when your Cross was fixed on Calvary; the gate-keepers
of Hell trembled when you were placed as a mortal in the sepulchre; for you destroyed the
strength of death and gave incorruption to the dead by your Resurrection, O Saviour. Giver
of life, glory to you!</p>

<p>Women longed to see your Resurrection, Christ God; Mary Magdalen came in anticipation;
she found the stone rolled away from the grave, and the Angel sitting and saying; Why do
you seek the living with the dead? He has risen as God, that he may save the universe.</p>

<p>Where is Jesus, whom you thought to guard? say, O Jews. Where is he whom you placed in
the grave, then sealed the stone? Give back the dead, you who denied life; give back the
buried or believe in the Risen One. Though you keep silent about the Lord's Rising, the
stones will cry out, above all the one that was rolled away from the grave. Great is your
mercy! Great the mystery of your dispensation! Our Saviour, glory to you!</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"><p><font color="#FF0000">8.</font> Through a tree Adam
  became an exile from Paradise; but through the tree of the Cross the Thief made his home
  in Paradise, for the former through tasting set aside his Maker's commandment, while the
  latter, crucified with him, confessed the hidden God, as he cried, &#145;Remember me in
  your kingdom&#146;.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">7.</font> You were lifted up on the Cross, O Lord, and you
  abolished the power of death, and as God you expunged the record against us. O only lover
  of mankind, grant the Thief&#146;s repentance to us also, who serve you with faith, O
  Christ our God, and cry to you, &#145;Remember us also in your kingdom&#146;.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">6.</font> On the Cross you tore up our record with the lance, and
  numbered among the dead you bound the tyrant there, so delivering all from the bonds of
  Hell by your Resurrection; through which, O Lord who loves mankind, we have been
  enlightened and we cry to you, &#145;Remember us also in your kingdom&#146;.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">5.</font> You were crucified and rose from the tomb on the third
  day as conqueror, and you raised Adam again the first-formed, O only Immortal, grant me
  also, Lord, to turn again to repentance from my whole heart, and ever cry to you with
  fervent faith, &#145;Remember me, O Saviour, in your kingdom&#146;.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">4.</font> For our sakes the impassible became a human, subject to
  suffering, and willingly nailed on the Cross he raised us with himself; therefore with the
  Cross we also glorify the Passion and Resurrection, through which we have been
  refashioned, and through which we are saved, as we cry, &#145;Remember us also in your
  kingdom&#146;.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">3.</font> Let us the faithful implore him who rose from the dead,
  despoiled the might of Hell and appeared to the women as he cried: Rejoice, to free our
  souls from corruption, as we ever cry to him in the words of the good Thief,
  &#145;Remember us also in your kingdom&#146;.</p>
