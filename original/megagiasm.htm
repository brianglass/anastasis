you came, Lord, having taken the form of a servant, asking for Baptism, though you did not
know sin. The waters saw you and were afraid. The Forerunner trembled and cried out,
saying, &#145;How will the lamp enlighten the Light? The servant place his hand on the
Master? Saviour, who take away the sin of the world, make me and the waters holy&#146;.</font></p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: Thirsty desert rejoice, let the desert exult and flower like a
lily. And the deserts of Jordan will flower and be overgrown and exult. And the glory of
Lebanon has been given to it and the honour of Carmel. And my people will see the glory of
the Lord and the majesty of God. Be strong, enfeebled hands and palsied knees. Give
comfort and say to the faint-hearted, &#145;Be strong and do not fear. See, our God is
giving judgement and will give it. He himself will come and save us. Then the eyes of the
blind will be opened and the ears of the deaf will hear. Then the lame will leap like a
deer and the tongue of stammerers will speak clearly, because water has broken out in the
desert and a channel in a thirsty land. And the waterless land will become pools and there
will be a spring of water for the thirsty land. There will be joy of birds there, folds
for flocks and reed beds and pools. And there will be a pure way there, and it will be
called a holy way, and no one unclean may pass along it. There will be no unclean way
there. But the scattered will walk upon it and not go astray. There will be no lion there,
nor will any evil wild beasts go up on it or be found there. But the redeemed and gathered
by the Lord will walk on it. And they will return and come to Sion with joy and
exultation, and everlasting joy will be upon their head. And on their head praise and
exultation and joy will possess them. Pain, grief and sighing have fled away.</p>

[</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">55,1-13</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">]</p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: You that thirst, go for water. And as many of you as have no money,
make your way and buy. And eat and drink wine and fat without money and price. Why do you
spend money on what is not food, and toil for what does not satisfy? Hear me, and eat what
is good, and your soul will delight in good things. Give heed with your ears and follow in
my ways. Listen to me and your soul will live among good things. And I will make an
eternal Covenant with you, the sure mercies of David. See, I have given him as a testimony
among the Nations, a ruler and commander among the Nations. See, Nations who do not know
you will call upon you, and peoples who are not acquainted with you will take refuge with
you, for the sake of the Lord your God and the Holy One of Israel, because he has
glorified you. Seek the Lord, and when you find him, call upon him. But when he comes near
you, let the impious abandon his ways and a lawless man his plans. And return to the Lord
and you will find mercy, and cry out, for he will abundantly forgive your sins. For my
plans are not like your plans, nor are my ways like your ways, says the Lord. But as far
as heaven is from earth, so far is my way from your ways and your thoughts from my mind.
For as rain or snow comes down from heaven and does not return until it has saturated the
earth and it brings forth and sprouts and gives seed to the sower and bread for food, so
will my word be. Whatever comes out of my mouth will not return to me empty, until
everything that I wished has been fulfilled. And I will make my ways and my commands
prosper. You will go out with gladness and be taught with joy. For the mountains and hills
will leap up, welcoming you with joy, and all the trees of the field will clap with their
branches. And instead of brambles cypress will come up, and instead of nettles myrtle will
come up. And there shall be for the Lord a name and an everlasting sign, and it will not
fail.</p>

<p>Thus says the Lord: Draw out water with gladness from the wells of salvation. And you
will say in that day, Sing to the Lord and cry out his name. Proclaim among the Nations
his glorious deeds, remind them that his name has been exalted. Sing to the name of the
Lord, for he has done great things. Proclaim these in all the earth. Exult and be glad,
you that dwell in Sion, because the Holy One of Israel has been exalted in the midst of
her.</font></p>

the sea. And they all ate the same spiritual food. And they all drank the same spiritual

<p>Lord Jesus Christ, only-begotten Son, who are in the bosom of the Father, true God,
source of life and immortality, Light from Light, who came into the world to enlighten it,
flood our mind with light by your Holy Spirit and accept us as we bring you praise and
thanksgiving for your wondrous mighty works from every age, and for your saving
dispensation in these last times. By it you clothe yourself in our weak and beggared
matter and coming down to the measure of our servitude, King of all, you accepted also to
be baptised in the Jordan by the hand of a servant, so that, having sanctified the nature
of the waters, you, the sinless one, might make a way for our rebirth through water and
Spirit and re-establish us in our original freedom. As we celebrate the memory of this
divine Mystery, we entreat you, Master, lover of mankind: Sprinkle on us, your unworthy
servants, cleansing water, in accordance with your divine promise, the gift of your
compassion, that the request of us sinners over this water may become acceptable by your
goodness and that through it your blessing to be granted to us and to all your faithful
people, to the glory of your holy, venerated Name. For to you belong all glory, honour and
worship, with your Father who is without beginning, with you all-holy, good and
life-giving Spirit, now and forever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Trinity beyond all being, beyond all goodness, beyond all godhead, all-powerful,
all-vigilant, invisible, incomprehensible; Creator of the spiritual beings and rational
natures, innate goodness, unapproachable Light that enlightens everyone coming into the
world, shine also in me your unworthy servant. Enlighten the eyes of my mind that I may
dare to sing the praise of your measureless benevolence and power. May my supplication for
the people here present be acceptable, so that my offences may not prevent the Holy Spirit
from being present here; but permit me now without condemnation to cry out to you and say,
Master, lover of mankind, beyond all goodness, Almighty, eternal King. We glorify you, the
Creator and Fashioner of the universe. We glorify you, only-begotten Son of God, without
father from your Mother, without mother from your Father. For in the preceding feast we
saw you as a babe, but in the present one we see you full and perfect man, our God, made
manifest as perfect God from perfect God. For today the moment of the feast is here for us
and the choir of saints assembles here with us, and Angels keep festival with mortals.
Today the grace of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove dwelt upon the waters. Today the
Sun that never sets has dawned and the world is made radiant with the light of the Lord.
Today the Moon with its radiant beams sheds light on the world. Today the stars formed of
light make the inhabited world lovely with the brightness of their splendour. Today the
clouds rain down from heaven the shower of justice for mankind. Today the Uncreated by his
own will accepts the laying on of hands by his own creature. Today the Prophet and
Forerunner draws near, but stands by with fear seeing God&#146;s condescension towards us.
Today the streams of Jordan are changed into healing by the presence of the Lord. Today
all creation is watered by mystical streams. Today the failings of mankind are being
washed away by the waters of Jordan. Today Paradise is opened for mortals and the Sun of
justice shines down on us. Today the bitter water as once for Moses&#146; people is
changed to sweetness by the presence of the Lord. Today we have been delivered from the
ancient grief, and saved as the new Israel. Today we have been redeemed from darkness and
are filled with radiance by the light of the knowledge of God. Today the gloomy fog of the
world is cleansed by the manifestation of our God. Today all creation shines with light
from on high. Today error has been destroyed and the coming of the Master makes for us a
way of salvation. Today things on high keep festival with those below, and those below
commune with those on high. Today the sacred and triumphant festal assembly of the
Orthodox exults. Today the Master hastens towards baptism, that he may lead humanity to
the heights. Today the One who does not bow bows down to his own servant, that he may free
us from servitude. Today we have purchased the Kingdom of heaven, for the Kingdom of the
Lord will have no end. Today earth and sea share the joy of the world, and the world has
been filled with gladness. The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and were afraid.
The Jordan turned back when it saw the fire of the godhead descending in bodily form and
entering it. The Jordan turned back as it contemplated the Holy Spirit in the form of a
dove, descending and flying about you. The Jordan turned back as it saw the Invisible made
visible, the Creator made flesh, the Master in the form of a servant. The Jordan turned
back and the mountains leapt as they saw God in the flesh, and the clouds uttered their
voice, marvelling at what had come to pass, seeing Light from Light, true God from true
God, the Master&#146;s festival today in Jordan; seeing him drowning the death from
disobedience, the goad of error and the bond of Hell in Jordan and granting the Baptism of
salvation to the world. Therefore I too, a sinner and your unworthy servant, recount the
greatness of your wonders and, seized with fear, in compunction cry out to you:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">After completing this, he says in a more powerful voice,</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Great are you, O Lord, and wonderful your works, and no word is adequate to sing the
praise of your wonders (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">x3</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">). [</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">People:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Glory to you, Lord, glory to you!]</p>

<p>For by your own will you brought the universe from non-existence into being, you hold
creation together by your might, and by your providence you direct the world. You composed
creation from four elements; with four seasons you crowned the circle of the year. All the
spiritual Powers tremble before you. The sun sings your praise, the moon glorifies you,
the stars entreat you, the light obeys you, the deeps tremble before you, the springs are
your servants. You stretched out the heavens on the waters; you walled in the sea with
sand; you poured out the air for breathing. Angelic Powers minister to you. The choirs of
the Archangels worship you. The many-eyed Cherubim and the six-winged Seraphim as they
stand and fly around you hide their faces in fear of your unapproachable glory. For you,
being God uncircumscribed, without beginning and inexpressible, came upon earth, taking
the form of a servant, being found in the likeness of mortals. For you could not bear,
Master, in the compassion of your mercy to watch the human race being tyrannised by the
devil, but you came and saved us. We acknowledge your grace, we proclaim your mercy, we do
not conceal your benevolence. You freed the generations of our race. You sanctified a
virgin womb by your birth. All creation sang your praise when you appeared. For you are
our God who appeared on earth and lived among mortals. You sanctified the streams of
Jordan by sending down from heaven your All-holy Spirit and you smashed the heads of the
dragons that lurked there.</p>

<p>Therefore, O King, lover of mankind, be present now too through the visitation of your
Holy Spirit, and sanctify this water. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">x3</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>And give to it the grace of redemption and the blessing of Jordan. Make it a source of
incorruption, a gift of sanctification, a deliverance from sins, an averting of diseases,
unapproachable by hostile powers, filled with angelic strength. That all who draw from it
and partake of it may have it for cleansing of souls and bodies, for healing of passions,
for sanctification of homes, for every suitable purpose. For you are our God, who through
water and Spirit renewed our nature made old by sin. You are our God, who in the days of
Noë drowned sin through the water of the flood. You are our God, who through Moses freed
the Hebrew race from the slavery of Pharao through the sea. You are our God who split open
the rock in the desert, and waters rushed out and torrents flooded down, and you satisfied
your thirsty people. You are our God, who through Elias turned Israel from the error of
Baal.</p>

<p>And now, Master, do you yourself sanctify this water by your Holy Spirit. (</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">x3</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">)</p>

<p>Give to all who partake of it sanctification, blessing, cleansing, health.</p>
