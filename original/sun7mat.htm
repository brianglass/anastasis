Benefactor to the ungrateful; the Liberator to the prisoners; the Sun of justice to those

<p>By your mighty power, Lord, you have smashed the gates of Hades and destroyed the might
of death; and raised with yourself the dead who slept from eternity in darkness, by your
divine and glorious Resurrection, as King of the universe and all-powerful God.</p>

<p>Come, let us rejoice in the Lord and be glad in his Resurrection; for he has raised the
dead with himself from the indissoluble bonds of Hades, and as God granted the world
eternal life and his great mercy.</p>

<p>A dazzling Angel sat on the stone of the grave that held Life, and gave the good
tidings to the Myrrh-bearing women saying: The Lord has risen, as he foretold to you;
announce to his Disciples that he goes before you into Galilee; while to the world he
grants eternal life and his great mercy.</p>

<p>Lawless Jews, why did you reject the Cornerstone? This is the stone which God placed in
Sion, the God who made water spring from the rock in the wilderness, and poured
immortality for us from his side; this is the stone which was hewn from the Virgin
mountain, with the will of man, the Son of man who is coming on the clouds of heaven
before the Ancient of days, as Daniel said, and his Kingdom is eternal.</p>
