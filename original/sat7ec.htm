<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Truly fearful and ineffable is the mystery that has been wrought in you, O Undefiled;
for you gave birth to the Word, cause of all things, beyond cause and word, who became
embodied by the holy Spirit, taking his flesh from you, while his own nature remained
unchanged. For when both had come together self-subsistently in a single hypostasis, he
came forth double in nature, wholly God and wholly man, displaying the wholeness in both
with active properties. For having suffered the passion in the flesh on the Cross, he
himself remained impassible in his godhead; having died as a mortal he came to life again
as God on the third day, after destroying the might of death and delivering humanity from
corruption. O Mother of God, ask him as the Redeemer and Saviour of our race to send down
to us the great mercy of his compassion.</font></p>

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>O Virgin, you became the Dayspring of the spiritual Sun, that came upon the sunset of
our nature; but as you have boldness, all-praised Mother of God, beseech him to free our
souls from numberless offences.</font></p>

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Listen, daughter, and see, and incline
your ear; and forget your people and your father&#146;s house.</p>

<p>Rod out Jesse&#146;s root, O Virgin, you manifestly gave bud to the one who uprooted
wholly the plants of deception; but as you have boldness, O all-praised, implore him
without ceasing to root out the passions of my heart, and to plant in it the fear of him
and save me.</font></p>

<p>Verse:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> The rich among the people of the land

<p>Gate of God, All-holy, deliver me from the gates of Hades and show me too the way of
repentance, through which I may find the gate that leads to life. Guide of those who have
gone astray, watch over the race of faithful people and save our souls.</p>

<p>From you, all-holy Virgin Mother of God, was born Christ our God, who is truly God
before the ages and lately man; as God existing eternally, as man he has come to be for
our sake. For in himself he preserves the property of each nature, causing the one to
shine forth by wonders, confirming the other by sufferings. Therefore one and the same he
both dies as man and rises again as God. Implore him, O honoured one who knew not wedlock,
that our souls may be saved.</font></p>

<p>After the Opening Psalm and the first Kathisma of the Psalter, at </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, I have cried </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">we insert 10 Stichera, and we sing 7 Resurrection Stichera and 3 from the

<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Come, let us rejoice in the Lord who has smashed the might of death and enlightened the
human race, as we cry with the Bodiless Powers: Our Creator and Saviour, glory to you!</p>

<p>For us, O Saviour, you endured the Cross and burial; but as God by your death you put
death to death; and so we worship your Resurrection on the third day. Lord, glory to you!</p>

<p>The Apostles marvelled when they saw the Creator&#146;s Rising and cried aloud the
angelic hymn of praise: This is the glory of the Church, this is the wealth of the
Kingdom. O Lord, who suffered for us, glory to you!</font></p>

<p>Though you were seized by lawless men, O Christ, yet you are my God, and I am not
ashamed; your back was scourged, I do not deny you; You were nailed to a Cross, and I do
not hide. I make my boast in your Rising; for your death is my life. All-powerful Lord who
love mankind, glory to you!</p>

<p>Fulfilling David&#146;s prophecy Christ revealed his own greatness in Sion to his
Disciples, showing that he was praised and ever glorified with the Father and the Holy
Spirit; before without flesh as Word. later for us incarnate and put to death as man, and
risen with authority as he loves mankind.</p>

<p>You descended into Hell as you willed, O Christ, you despoiled death as God and master;
and you rose on the third day, raising with yourself from the bonds of Hell and from
corruption Adam as he cried and said: Glory to your Resurrection, only lover of mankind.</p>

<p>You were laid in a tomb, O Lord, as one who slept and you rose on the third day as one
powerful in strength, raising Adam with yourself from the corruption of death, as
all-powerful.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Glory. Both now. Theotokion.</p>

<p>You were known as a Mother beyond nature, O Mother of God; you remained a Virgin beyond
reason and understanding; no tongue can expound the marvel of your child-bearing; for
while your conceiving, Pure One, was wondrous, the manner of your bearing child cannot be
comprehended, for wherever God wills the order of nature is overthrown. Therefore as we
all acknowledge you to be Mother of God we implore you insistently: Intercede that our
souls may be saved.</p>

<p>As the treasure-house of our Resurrection, All-praised Lady, bring up from the pit and

Virgin in bearing child and after bearing child you are still Virgin.</font>
