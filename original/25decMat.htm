<p>Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been
betrothed to Joseph, but before they had come together, she was found to be with child
from the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to expose her to
public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. But just when he had resolved to do this,
an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, &#145;Joseph, son of David, do
not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the
Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his
people from their sins.&#146; All this took place to fulfil what had been spoken by the
Lord through the prophet: &#145;See, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they
shall call his name Emmanuel,&#146; which means, &#145;God is with us.&#146; When Joseph
awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife,
but he did not know her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus.</font></p>

great king; and having followed the star, they found Christ the Lord, and falling down
they worshipped him and offered him gold, incense and myrrh. And so, on the orders of an
Angel, they returned to their country.</p>

<p>Herod, the prince of the Jews, having learned from the Magi that a great king had been
born, who was going to subdue the whole world, summoned the Magi secretly and said,
&#145;Go, inquire diligently about the child, and when you have found him, bring me word,
that I too may go and worship him&#146;. He said this to learn where he was and that he
might send and kill him. Then, having summoned the Scribes, he asked, &#145;Where does
Scripture say that the Christ will be born?&#146; They said, &#145;In Bethlehem of
Judea&#146;. Then he sent his troops to slaughter the boys in Bethlehem of two years and
under. Because of this an Angel was sent from God who said to Joseph, &#145;Rise, take the
Child and his Mother, and flee into Egypt&#146;. Joseph did so, and taking the Child and
his Mother he went away into Egypt.</font></p>

<p>&#145;The Youths brought up together in godliness, scorning the impious decree, feared
not the threat of fire, but standing in the midst of the flame they sang: God of our
Fathers, blessed are you!&#146;</p>

<p>Shepherds abiding in the fields had a vision of light which filled them with fear; for
the glory of the Lord shone round them and an Angel crying aloud: Sing praises, for Christ
is born. God of our Fathers, blessed are you!&#146;</p>

<p>Suddenly, at the word of the Angel, the armies of heaven cried: Glory to God in the
highest, on earth peace, among men good will, Christ, has shone forth. God of our Fathers,
blessed are you!&#146;</p>

<p>What is this word? the Shepherds said. Let us go that we may see what has come to pass,
Christ God. Having come to Bethlehem they worshipped him, with her who gave him birth, as
they sang out: God of our Fathers, blessed are you!&#146;</font></p>

<p>&#145;Caught and held fast by love for the King of all,<br>
&#145;The Young Men despised the impious threats<br>
&#145;Of the tyrant in his boundless fury;<br>
&#145;And when the dread fire withdrew from them, they said<br>
&#145;To the Master: Unto all ages, blessed are you!&#146;</p>

Burnt up when heated sevenfold the servants,<br>
But the Young Men it saves, as victors crowns.<br>
On whom the Lord, rewarding piety,<br>
Bestows abundantly his cooling dew.</p>

<p>Christ our Defender, you shamed mortals&#146; foe,<br>
Having your incarnation beyond speech<br>
As shield, in human form bringing the joy<br>
Of being like God; in hope of which we once<br>
Fell from on high into the murky depths.</p>

<p>You have cast down by your almighty power<br>
Fierce sin that raised its head in wanton pride,<br>
And raged blaspheming through a world gone mad.<br>

<p>&#145;The furnace moist with dew was the image and the figure of a wonder past nature;
for it did not burn those it had received; even as the fire of the godhead did not consume
the Virgin&#146;s womb into which it has descended. Therefore in praise let us sing: Let
all creation bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages&#146;.</p>

<p>The daughter of Babylon once dragged to herself from Sion David&#146;s children, taken
by the spear; now she sends her children, Magi taking gifts, to entreat David&#146;s
daughter, who received God. Therefore in praise let us sing: Let all creation bless the
Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.</p>

<p>Sorrow silenced the instruments of song, for Sion&#146;s children did not sing among
strangers; but Christ, shining forth from Bethlehem, abolishes all the error of Babylon
and the harmony of her musicians. Therefore in praise let us sing: Let all creation bless
the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.</p>

<p>Babylon received the spoils of Sion the Queen and her wealth taken by the spear; Christ
in Sion draws with a guiding star her treasures, Magi who scanned the stars. Therefore in
praise let us sing: Let all creation bless the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.</font></p>
