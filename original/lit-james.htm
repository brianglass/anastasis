<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>The Divine Liturgy of St James, which was until recently only celebrated on the island
of Zakynthos on his feast on 23 October and in Jerusalem on the Sunday after Christmas, is
today celebrated in an increasing number of Orthodox churches. It was the ancient rite of
Jerusalem, as the Mystagogic Catecheses of St Cyril of Jerusalem imply. It is still, in
its Syrian form, the principal liturgy of the Syrian Oriental Church, both in Syriac and,
in the ancient Syrian Orthodox Church of India, in Malayalam and English.</p>

<p>This version of the Greek Liturgy of St James is highly provisional and tentative,
principally because none of the editions available agree among themselves. The only
critical edition is the one published by Dom B.-Ch. Mercier in volume 26 of the Patrologia
Orientalis in 1950. This is extremely detailed and learned, but totally unusable as a
practical edition, which it was not intended to be. Other scholarly editions can be found
in Swainson&#146;s &#145;Greek Liturgies&#146; [1884] and in Brightman&#146;s
&#145;Liturgies Eastern and Western&#146; [1896]. Neale and Littledale published an
English translation in their &#145;Translations of the Primitive Liturgies&#146; [1859],
which rather charmingly suggests in one or two footnotes that St Paul actually quotes from
it in his Epistles. &#145;Practical&#146; editions of the Greek have been issued by the
Apostoliki Diakonia in Athens and by Holy Cross in the United States [1988]. The latter
contains a parallel English translation. Both these editions are heavily abbreviated and
seriously &#145;byzantinised&#146;. A Slavonic version of the Greek, made by Father Philip
Gardner, was authorised by the Russian Church Abroad in 1938. This was translated into
hyper-Cranmerian English, which even extends to the Introduction, by the Monastery of St
Mark of Ephesus in New Jersey forty years later. This version is more than abundantly
supplied with very detailed, but sometimes contradictory, rubrics, though where these come
from is unclear. Like the two modern Greek editions, the Liturgy is abbreviated and
byzantinised.</p>

<p>The present translation is based on Mercier&#146;s edition and tries as far as possible
to give a reliable version of the best text available. Since, however, it was also made
for actual use, the extremely long commemoration of the Saints towards the end of the
Anaphora has been drastically curtailed. On the other hand it preserves a number of what
are probably &#145;doublets&#146; of prayers in the manuscripts. It should be noted that
the rite of the Fraction supposes that a &#145;Syrian&#146; type of prosphora is being
used. That is to say a small, flattish loaf about three inches in diameter, rather than
the standard Byzantine prosphora. The fraction is also made easier if the seal used is of
the Syrian type, divided into sections and covered with small crosses.</p>

<p>I hope to revise this version in the near future and to complete it by the addition of
the long catalogue of Saints. What is here offered is so in the hope that the magnificent
prayers of this ancient Liturgy may become more widely known both inside and outside the
Church. </font></p>

<font FACE="Bangkok" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Prayer of the Prothesis</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>In the skevophylakion the Priest says:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, the one, simple and
undivided Trinity, that unites and sanctifies us through itself, and brings peace to our
lives, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Then, imploring the Deity on his own behalf, the priest says:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Defiled as I am by many sins, do not utterly reject me, Master, Lord, our God. For see,
I draw near to this divine and heavenly mystery, not as though I were worthy, but, looking
to your goodness, I raise my voice to you, &#145;God, be merciful to me, a sinner. For I
have sinned against heaven and before you, and I am not worthy to lift up my eyes to this
your sacred and spiritual Table, on which your only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,
is mystically set forth as a sacrifice by me, a sinner stained by every defilement.
Therefore I bring you this supplication, that your Spirit, the Advocate, may be sent down
to me, strengthening and preparing me for this ministry. And grant that without
condemnation the word that has been declared by you may be proclaimed by me to the people
in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom you are blessed, together with your all-holy, good,
life-giving and consubstantial Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen. </font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Before the Royal Doors, as the clergy are about to make the Entrance, the Priest says
aloud:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, the triple and single light
of the one Godhead, that exists singly in Trinity and is divided without division. For the
one God is Trinity, whose glory the heavens declare, while earth proclaims his dominion,
the sea his might and every physical and immaterial creature his greatness. For to him
belongs all glory, honour, might, greatness and magnificence, now and for ever, and to the
ages of ages.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>People:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Amen.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Then the Priest begins the prayers of the Enarxis (aloud).</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Benefactor and King of the ages, and Fashioner of all creation, accept your Church,
which approaches you through your Christ. Fulfil what is profitable for each, bring all to
perfection, and make us worthy of the grace of your sanctification, gathering us together
in your Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, which you gained by the blood of your
only-begotten Son, our Lord and saviour, Jesus Christ, with whom you are blessed and
glorified, together with your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and forever, and
to the ages of ages.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<font FACE="Bangkok" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Prayer of the Incense at the Entrance</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>Priest, aloud:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>O God, who accepted the gifts of Abel, the sacrifices of Noë and Abraham, the incense
of Aaron and Zachary, accept from the hands of us sinners this incense for a sweet
fragrance and forgiveness of our sins and those of all your people. For you are blessed
and to you belongs glory, to the Father with your only-begotten Son and your all-holy,
good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>The Deacon censes and begins the </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Only-begotten
Son</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">, and the Singers chant the
Troparion for the Entrance of the clergy with the holy Gospel.</p>

<p>The Singers: </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Only-begotten Son and Word of
God, who, being immortal, accepted for our salvation to take flesh from the holy Mother of
God and Ever-Virgin Mary, and without change became man; you were crucified, Christ God,
by death trampling on death, being one of the Holy Trinity, glorified with the Father and
the Holy Spirit: save us!</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>When those making the entrance reach the middle of the church, where a vima [platform]
has been set up, they place the holy Gospel on it, and go towards the sanctuary. The
Priest, standing in front of the holy Doors, says, aloud:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>Almighty God, Lord, whose name is great, who give us entrance to the Holy of Holies
through the coming of your only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ,
we entreat and implore your goodness. Since we are full of fear and trembling as we are
about to stand before your holy altar, send forth your good grace upon us, sanctify our
souls, bodies and spirits and change our thoughts to true devotion, so that, with a pure
conscience, we may offer you gifts, presents, fruits, for the removal of our sins, for the
forgiveness of all your people, by the grace and love for humankind of your only-begotten
Son, with whom you are blessed, together with your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit,
now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.</font></p>

<p>People:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> Amen.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>And the Priest enters the sanctuary.</p>

<p>Facing the People, the Deacon says:</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">

<p>In peace, let us pray to the Lord.</font></p>
<font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">

<p>People (after each petition): </font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4">Lord, have

souls, let us pray to the Lord.</p>

<p>For the peace of the whole world and the union of all the holy churches of God, let us

<p>For the forgiveness of our sins and pardon of our offences, and for us to be delivered
from all affliction, wrath, danger, constraint and assault of enemies, let us pray to the
Lord.</p>

<p>Let us call to mind our most holy, pure, most glorious and blessed Lady, Mother of God
and Ever-Virgin Mary, of the holy, glorious Prophet, Forerunner and Baptist John, of the
holy, godlike and all-praised Apostles, of the glorious Prophets and victorious Martyrs
and all the holy and just, that by their prayers and intercessions we may all find mercy.</font></p>

<p>Compassionate and merciful, long-suffering, most merciful and true Lord, look down from
your holy dwelling-place, hearken to us, your, suppliants, and deliver us from every trial
and temptation, both diabolic and human. Do not deprive us of your help, nor bring upon us
heavier chastisement than we are able to bear. For we are not capable of conquering what
opposes us, while you, Lord, have power to save us from all adversities. Save us, O God,
from the difficulties of this world in accordance with your goodness, so that, having
entered your holy altar with a pure conscience, we may, without condemnation, offer you
with the heavenly Powers the blessed and thrice-holy hymn, and have accomplished the
divine ministry that is well-pleasing to you, we may be found worthy of eternal life.</font></p>

sanctification, and to you we give glory and thanksgiving, to the Father, the Son and the
Holy Spirit.</font></p>

<p>Deacon:</font><font FACE="Book Antiqua" SIZE="4"> We thank you, Christ our God, that
you have counted us worthy to partake of your Body and Blood for forgiveness of sins and
everlasting life. Keep, we entreat, without condemnation, as you are good and love
humankind.</font></p>

<p>You have made us glad, O God, by union with you, and we offer you incense of gratitude,
fruit of our lips, as we confess your grace. Let it ascend, O God, and not descend empty,
but grant too the pure and lasting myron of the sweet fragrance of your all-holy Spirit.
Fill our mouths with praise and our lips with gladness and our hearts with joy and delight
in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom you are blessed with your all-holy Spirit, now and for
ever and to the ages of ages.</font></p>

Ever-Virgin Mary, with all the Saints and Just, let us entrust ourselves and one another

great and ineffable compassion, have condescended to the weakness of your servants, and
counted us worthy to partake of this heavenly table, do not condemn us sinners for
communicating of your immaculate mysteries, but preserve us, O Good One, in your

lot with all the Saints from the beginning, who have been well-pleasing to you, in the
light of your face, through the compassion of your only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and
Saviour Jesus Christ, with whom you are blessed and glorified, with your all-holy, good

<p>You have given us sanctification, Master, by the communion of the all-holy Body and
