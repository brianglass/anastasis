INTRODUCTION
------------

This Short Synaxarion contains all the commemorations of Saints and the
other feasts and events listed in the Greek Menaion, together with the
verses that accompany the entries. It is ’short’ because it does not
include the detailed notices which usually follow the verses. Some of
these will be found on other pages where the full office for the day is
given.

The two line verses are written in iambic trimeters, of a sort, but are
translated here into standard English ’iambic’ pentameters. These verses
abound in paronomasia on the names of the saints, and these I have
indicated by including transcriptions of the relevant Greek words within
brackets.

The extra line, that normally accompanies the first, or the principal,
entry each day and which mentions the date, forms a heroic hexameter,
with frequent use of epic vocabulary and grammatical forms. I have
translated them into English hexameters, though without attempting to
reproduce the archaising effect of the original language.

The transliteration of proper names is not scientific, or consistent,
but in general follows contemporary pronunciation. Latin names have been
given in their Latin, not their Greek, form. Stress accents are
generally as in modern Greek. Sometimes I use traditional English forms
and stresses, as in ’MÃ³ses’ or ’JÃ³nas’.
