ORDER FOR THE ORDINATION OF A WOMAN DEACON

[Holy and All-powerful God, through the birth in flesh of your
Only-begotten Son and our God from a Virgin you sanctified woman, and
granted not only to men but also to women the grace and visitation of
the Holy Spirit. Now, Master, look upon this servant of yours also, call
her to the work of your service[[\[3\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference

down upon her the rich gift of your Holy Spirit. Guard her in your
Orthodox faith in a blameless way of life in accordance with what is
well pleasing to you, as she fulfils her
ministry[[\[4\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference

[After the ]{style="font-size:14.0pt;

[one of the Deacons prays as

[In peace, let us pray to the Lord. [And the rest, as in the ordination

for the
candidate.]{style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"}]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"}

[While the Deacon is saying this, the Bishop, with his hand still
resting on the head of the one being ordained, prays as

[Master and Lord, you do not reject women who offer themselves, and by
divine counsel, to minister as is fitting to your holy houses, but you
accept them in the order of ministers. Give the grace of your Holy
Spirit to this servant of yours also, who wishes to offer herself to
you, and to accomplish the grace of the diaconate, as you gave the grace
of your diaconate to Phoebe, whom you called to the work of the
ministry. Grant her, O God, to persevere without condemnation in your
holy churches, to give careful attention to her way of life, to chastity
in particular, and show her to be your perfect servant, that, when she
stands before the judgement of Christ, she may also receive the fitting
reward of her way of life.[[\[6\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference

whom you are blessed,[ etc.]{style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:

Maphorion, bringing the two extremities round to the

[After she has received Communion of the holy Body and Blood, the Bishop
hands her the Chalice. When she has taken it, she places it on the holy
Table.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;

takes place at the same point of the Liturgy as that for male Deacons
and the role of the diaconate as the minister of the Chalice is stressed
by the giving of the Chalice to the newly ordained woman Deacon. This
clearly indicates that the newly ordained was admitted to the Sanctuary
and stood near the Altar. The 14th century canonist Matthew Blastares
notes that, Â’except for a few things, the ordination of women deacons
is to be performed like that for male deaconsÂ’. He notes particularly
that Â‘she is brought to the Holy TableÂ’. The rubrical details in the[ 
]{style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"}older books are
few and the actual formula of ordination is not given in full. As a
result we do not know how the candidate was described or what her
ecclesiastical status was before ordination. I do not think the fact
that she only bows and does not kneel has any theological
signifance.]{style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"}

[[\[1\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference} This prayer is less specific than that
for male Deacons and makes no reference to the Â‘service of the

ordination.]{style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"}

Whereas the model for the male diaconate is St Stephen, that for women
Deacons is St Phoebe of Kenchreae, who is clearly described as a
Â‘DeaconÂ’ in Romans 16. In contrast to the prayers for male ordinands,
the prayer underlines that fact that the woman has offered herself for
ordination, which is more reminiscent of the rite of monastic
profession.]{style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"}

[[[\[7\]]{.MsoFootnoteReference

The woman Deacon is specifically said to be vested in a Â‘deaconÂ’s
orarionÂ’, but she wears it with both ends hanging down in front, like a
western stole, rather than over the left shoulder. This difference
appears to be purely practical, since the woman Deacon would be wearing
the *maphorion*, or ample monastic veil, which would make wearing the
orarion over her shoulder difficult.
