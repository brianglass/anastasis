SUNDAY\
OF THE HOLY PENTECOST

ON SATURDAY EVENING
===================

AT SMALL VESPERS
----------------

**At** Lord, I have cried **we insert 4 Stichera and sing the following
3 Idiomels in Tone 1, doubling the 1st.**

We celebrate Pentecost and the coming of the Spirit, the appointed time
of the promise and the fulfilment of hope. How great is the mystery?
Great indeed and revered! And so we cry out to you: Creator of all,
Lord, glory to you! (

**Twice**)

With tongues of foreigners, O Christ, you renewed your Disciples, that
through them they might proclaim you, the immortal Word and God, who
grant our souls your great mercy.

The Holy Spirit gives all things: makes prophecies flow, perfects
priests, taught the unlettered wisdom, revealed fishermen to be
theologians, welds together the whole institution of the Church.
Advocate, consubstantial and equal in majesty with the Father and the
Son, glory to you.

Glory. Both now.

**Tone 8.**

When you sent down your Spirit, Lord, to the Apostles as they were
sitting, then the children of the Hebrews saw it and were beside
themselves with amazement; for they were hearing them speaking in other,
strange tongues, as the Spirit gave them; for though simple men, they
had been made wise; and having caught the nations for the faith, were
preaching things divine; and we also cry out to you: You appeared on
earth and saved us; Lord, glory to you.

****

Aposticha. Idiomels. Tone 2.

We have seen the true light, we have received the heavenly Spirit, we
have found the true faith, as we worship the undivided Trinity, for the
same has saved us.

****

Verse:

Create a pure heart in me, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.

In the Prophets you announced to us the way of salvation, our Saviour,
and in the Apostles there shone the grace of your Spirit; you are God
first of all, and in the future; and to the ages you are our God.

****

Verse:

Do not cast me from your presence; and do not take your Holy Spirit from
me.

In your courts I will sing your praise, as the Saviour of the world, and
bending the knee I will worship your invincible power, at evening and
morning and midday, and at every moment I will bless you, O Lord.

Glory. Both now.

**Same Tone.**

Let us sing the praise of the consubstantial Trinity, Father and Son
with the Holy Spirit; for thus all the Prophets proclaimed, and the
Apostles with the Martyrs.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 8.

Blessed are you, Christ our God, who revealed the fishermen to be most
wise by sending down to them the Holy Spirit, and so through them
catching the whole world in a net: Lover of mankind, glory to you!

And Dismissal.

AT GREAT VESPERS
================

**After the Opening Psalm and the 1st Kathisma of the Psalter, at**
Lord, I have cried**, we insert 10 Stichera and sing 3 Idiomels in Tone
1, doubling the 1st; then 5 in Tone 2, again doubling the 1st.**

Tone 1.

praise you, the Father without beginning, and the Son, likewise without
beginning, and the co-eternal and all-holy Spirit, who enlighten and
hallow our souls.

Let us sing the praise of the consubstantial Trinity, Father and Son
with the Holy Spirit; for thus all the Prophets proclaimed, and the
Apostles with the Martyrs.

Glory. Both now.

**Tone 8.\
By the Emperor Leo.**

Come, you peoples, let us worship the Godhead in three persons, the Son
in the Father, with the Holy Spirit; for the Father timelessly begot the
Son, co-eternal and co-reigning, and the Holy Spirit was in the Father,
glorified with the Son; one power, one essence, one Godhead, whom we all
worship as we say: Holy God, who created all things through the Son,
with the co-operation of the Holy Spirit. Holy Strong, through whom we
have come to know the Father, and through whom the Holy Spirit came into
the world. Holy Immortal, the Advocate Spirit, who proceeds from the
Father and rests in the Son. Holy Trinity, glory to you.

Entrance

. O joyful Light, **the Prokeimenon of the day and the Readings.**

The Reading is from Numbers.\
\[

**11:16-17, 24-29**\]

The Lord said to Moses: Gather to me seventy men of the elders of the
people, whom you know to be elders of the people, and their scribes; and
you shall bring to the Tent of Witness, and they shall stand there with
you. And I shall come down and speak with you there, and I shall take of
the Spirit which is upon you and place it upon them, and they shall bear
the burden of the people with you, and you shall not bear them alone.
And Moses gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and stood
them around the Tent. And the Lord came down in a cloud and spoke to
Moses, and he took of the Spirit which was upon him and placed it upon
the seventy men, the elders. But as the Spirit rested upon them, they
too prophesied in the camp, and then did so no longer. And two men had
been left behind in the camp; the name of one was Eldad and the name of
the second was Modad, and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of
those who had been listed, but they had not come to the Tent; and they
prophesied in the camp. And the youth ran and told Moses, and said to
him: Eldad and Modad are prophesying in the camp. And Jesus, son of
Navi, who was Moses’ assistant, his chosen one, said: My Lord Moses,
stop them. And Moses said to him: Why, are you jealous for me? And who
would not give that all the Lord’s people were prophets, whenever the
Lord should put his Spirit upon them?

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Joel.\
\[

**2:23-32**\]

Thus says the Lord: Children of Sion rejoice, and be glad in the Lord
your God, because he has given you food for justice; and he will send
the early and the latter rain for you, as before; and the threshing
floors will be full of corn, and the presses overflowing with wine and
oil. And I shall repay you for the years that the locust has devoured,
the crawling locust, the consuming locust, the chewing locust and my
great power which I sent against you. And eating you shall eat and be
filled, and praise the name of the Lord your God, who has done wondrous
things with you, and my people shall no longer be ashamed for ever. And
you shall know that I the Lord your God am in the midst of Israel, and
there is none beside me, and my people shall no longer be ashamed for
ever. And it shall be after these things that I will pour out of my
Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy
and your elders will dream dreams and your youths see visions. And upon
my servants and my maid servants I shall pour out of my Spirit in those
days, and they will prophesy; and I shall show wonders in the heaven
above and signs in the earth beneath, blood and fire and the vapour of
smoke; the sun will be transformed to darkness and the moon to blood,
before the great and manifest day of the Lord comes; and it shall be
that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.

The Reading is from the Prophecy of Ezekiel.\
\[

**36:24-28**\]

Thus says the Lord: I shall take you from among the nations and gather
you from all the lands and bring you into your own land; and I shall
sprinkle pure water upon you, and you will be purified from all your
impurities and from all your idols, and I shall purify you; and I shall
give you a new heart and I shall give you a new spirit; and I shall take
away the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh;
and I shall put my spirit in you and make you walk in my statutes and
you shall keep my judgements and do them; and you shall dwell on the
land which I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I
shall be your God.

At the Liti, Idiomel Stichera. Tone 2

In the Prophets you announced to us the way of salvation, our Saviour,
and in the Apostles shone the grace of your Spirit; you are God first of
all, and in the future; and to the ages you are our God.

In your courts I will sing your praise as the Saviour of the world, and
bending the knee I will worship your invincible power, at evening and
morning and midday, and at every moment I will bless you, O Lord.

In your courts, Lord, bending the knee of soul and body we the faithful

****

At the Aposticha, Idiomel Stichera. Tone 8.

The nations, Lord, not knowing the power of the all-holy Spirit which
had come to the Apostles, thought the change of tongues was drunkenness;
but we, established by them, unceasingly say: Do not take your Holy
Spirit from us, we implore, O Lover of mankind.

****

Verse:

Create a clean heart in me, O God; and renew a right Spirit within me.

The coming of the Holy Spirit, Lord, filled your Apostles and made them
ready to speak in other tongues; therefore the marvel was thought by the
unbelieving to be drunkenness, but by believers to be the agent of
salvation; make us too worthy of its illumination, we implore, O Lover
of mankind.

****

Verse:

Do not cast me away from your presence; and do not take your Holy Spirit
from me.

Heavenly King, Paraclete, Spirit of Truth, present everywhere, filling
all things, Treasury of blessings and Giver of life; come and dwell in
us, cleanse us from every stain, and, O Good One save our souls.

Glory. Both now.

**Tone 8.**

Once tongues were confused through the presumption of building the
tower; but now tongues have been made wise through the glory of the
knowledge of God. There God condemned the impious for their offence;
here Christ has enlightened the fishermen with the Spirit. Then discord
was wrought for punishment; now concord is renewed for the salvation of
our souls.

****

Apolytikion. Tone 8.

Blessed are you, Christ our God, who revealed the fishermen to be most
wise by sending down to them the Holy Spirit, and so through them
catching the whole world in a net: Lover of mankind, glory to you!

=========

**After the 1st Reading from the Psalter, Kathisma.\
Tone 4. Joseph was amazed.**

Believers, let us radiantly celebrate the post-festal and final feast;
for this is Pentecost, fulfilment of the promise and the appointed time;
for on this day the fire of the Advocate came down immediately to earth,
as in the form of tongues, and enlightened the Disciples, and revealed
them as initiates of heaven. The light of the Advocate has come and
enlightened the world. (

**Twice**) ****

After the 2nd Reading, Kathisma.\
Same melody.

The well-spring of the Spirit, coming down on those on earth and parted
into fire-bearing rivers, spiritually bedewed the Apostles and guided
them to light; and the fire became for them a cloud of dew and a flame
of rain enlightening them, through whom we have received grace through
fire and water. The light of the Advocate has come and enlightened the
world. (

**Twice**)

**SELECTION FOR THE POLYELEOS**

The firmament. Alleluia.

The heavens declare the glory of God: the firmament proclaims the work
of his hands.

By the Word of the Lord the heavens were established; and by the Spirit
of his mouth all their power.

For he leaned out from his holy height; the Lord looked from heaven, he
saw all the children of humankind.

Fire will go before him. Coals were kindled by it.

He bowed the heavens and came down.

From the brightness before him the clouds broke through.

The wings of a dove covered in silver. Its back with the lustre of gold.

From Sion the loveliness of his beauty, when the heavenly one gives
orders.

Kings upon her will be as snow on Selmon.

All the ends of the earth will remember and turn back to the Lord.

And all the tribes of the nations will worship before him:

For the Kingdom is the Lord’s, and he is Master of the nations.

The law of the Lord is spotless, converting souls.

The testimony of the Lord is faithful, making infants wise.

The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.

The commandment of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes.

The earth was shaken and the heavens melted before the face of the God
of Sinai, before the face of the God of Israel.

You granted generous rain, O God, to your inheritance, which was weak;
but you restored it.

Instead of your fathers, sons will be born to you. You will establish
them as princes over all the earth.

Their sound has gone out into all the earth; and their word to the ends
of the earth.

You will send forth your Spirit and they will be created, and you will
renew the face of the earth.

Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land.

Create a clean heart in me, O God; and renew a right Spirit within me.

Do not cast me from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from
me.

Give me the joy of your salvation, And establish me with a sovereign
Spirit.

The Lord will give the word to those who preach the Gospel with great
power.

The Lord will give strength to his people. The Lord will bless his
people with peace.

Glory. Both now. Alleluia.

Taking knowledge.

After your Rising from the tomb, O Christ, and your divine Assumption to
the height of heaven, you sent down your glory to your Disciples who had
seen God, renewing a right spirit within them, O Merciful Saviour;

plectrum your melodies and your dispensation. (

Troparia

As you promised your Disciples of old, you have sent forth the Advocate

That which was proclaimed of old in Law and Prophets has been fulfilled;

believers.

Another Canon, in Iambics, whose acrostic is contained in the following
elegiac couplets:

Only-begotten of God, from the heart of the Father you sent to\
Those upon earth once again other Advocate, Spirit divine,\
Bringing, in tongues made of fire, of the pure, immaterial Godhead,\
Sign of your nature and grace for those who are minstrels of praise.

****

A Composition of Kyr John Arklas.\
Ode 1. Tone 4. Irmos.

The slow of tongue, covered in divine darkness,\
Proclaimed the law written by God;\
For shaking the dust from his mind’s eye,\
He sees the One Who Is, and is initiated\
Into knowledge of the Spirit, as he gives praise with songs inspired.

****

Troparia

The revered and august mouth spoke:\
For you my friends there will be no absence.\
For I, once seated on my Father’s highest throne,\
Will pour out the unstinted grace of the Spirit\
To shine on those who yearn.

The firm Definition, most precise Word,\
Brings calm perfection to the heart;\
For, his work accomplished, Christ gladdened his friends,\
With a mighty wind and tongues of fire,\
Apportioning the Spirit, as he had promised.

Katavasias

Ode 3. Irmos.

You told your Disciples, O Christ: Wait in Jerusalem, until you are
clothed with the power from on high; while I will send you another
Advocate as myself, my Spirit and the Father’s, in whom you will be
established.

****

Troparion.

When the power of the divine Spirit came down, it divinely united in one

Inapprehensible is the blaze of the Godhead;\
For it revealed the unlettered to be orators,\
Bridling the mouths of sophists in abundance with a word,\
And raising from deep night\
Unnumbered peoples by the Spirit’s lightning flash.

From the unbegotten light proceeded\
The imperishable Splendour, illuminating with almighty operation,\
Whose fiery sound now reveals the consubstantial beacon\
Of the Father’s authority through the Son\
In Sion to the nations.

Katavasias

Kathisma. Tone 8. Taking knowledge.

The lovers of the Saviour were filled with joy, and they, who before had
been cowardly, took courage, for the Holy Spirit came down to-day upon
the house of the Disciples, and each spoke in a different tongue to the
peoples; for tongues, seen as fire, were parted, yet did not burn them
up but rather bedewed them. (

unite yourself, O compassionate, with those who long for you, that
united to you we may hymn and glorify your All-holy Spirit.

****

Synaxarion from the Menaion, then the following:

On the same day, the eighth Sunday from Pascha, we celebrate the holy
Pentecost.

****

Verses.\

With mighty wind, in form like tongues of fire\
Christ gives God’s Spirit now to the Apostles.\
Spirit on this great day on fishers poured.

This feast we also took from the Hebrew Bible; for just as they
celebrate Pentecost, honouring the number seven, and that when they had
passed through fifty days from Pascha they received the Law, so we too
as we celebrate for fifty days after Pascha receive the all-holy Spirit,
who gives laws and guides into all truth and lays down what is pleasing
to God.

Note that there are three Feasts among the Hebrews, Pascha, Pentecost
and Tabernacles. They keep Pascha to commemorate the crossing of the Red
Sea - for word Pascha means ‘crossing’. While this same feast showed our
crossing and ascent from the darkness of sin towards Paradise.

They celebrated Pentecost in commemoration of their suffering in the
wilderness, and how they were brought through many afflictions in the
land of promise, for then they enjoyed fruit, corn and wine. And it
showed our misery through unbelief and our entry into the Church; for
then we also receive communion of the Body and Blood of the Master. Some
say that this is the reason that Pentecost is celebrated by the Hebrews.
Others however say that it is honour of the fifty days that Moses fasted
and received the Law written by God. At the same time they commemorate
the sacrifice to the calf and the other things which Moses performed,
ascending and descending the Mount. Differently it was thought that
Pentecost was observed by the Hebrews because of honour for the number
seven, as has been said; for this number multiplied by itself makes
fifty days less one. The honour of the Pentecostal fifty is not only in
days but in years, from which was born the Jubilee among them; for this
happens when years are multiplied seven times. Then they leave the
ground unsown and give relief to animals and they allow bought slaves to
leave.

The third feast is that of Tabernacles, celebrated after the harvest,
that is to say five months after Pascha. It was established to
commemorate the day when Moses first fixed the Tabernacle that had been
revealed on Mount Sinai through a cloud and which had been constructed
by the master craftsman BeseleÃªl. For they would make tabernacles and
celebrate this feast, living in the fields and giving thanks to God, and
they would bring in the fruits of their own labours. And it seem that it
was for this that David entitled the Psalms For the wine vats. This was
a type of our resurrection from the dead, when our earthly tabernacles
are dissolved and put together again and we shall enjoy the fruits of
our own labours and keep festival in eternal tabernacles.

It is to be noted that on this day, when Pentecost was completed, the
Holy Spirit came to dwell upon the Disciples. But since it seemed good
to the holy Fathers to divide the feasts, because of the greatness of
the all-holy and life-giving Spirit, because the Spirit is one of the
holy Trinity, source of life, so we too will say tomorrow how the holy
Spirit came to dwell.

At the prayers of the holy Apostles, Christ our God, have mercy on us.
Amen.

****

Ode 7. Irmos

Cast into the furnace of fire, the holy Youths changed the fire to dew
through their hymns of praise, as thus they sang: Blessed are you, O
Lord, the God of our fathers.

****

Troparia

As the Apostles eloquently proclaimed the mighty works of God, the
operation of the Spirit was thought by the unbelieving to be
drunkenness, that operation through which the Trinity is known, one God
of our fathers.

With right belief we confess the undivided nature, God the Father
without beginning, the Word and Spirit of the same authority, as we cry:
Blessed are you, the God of our fathers.

****

Another Irmos.

Harmonious melody of instruments decreed\
Reverence to the lifeless idol wrought of gold.\
But the Advocate’s life-bearing grace\
Inspires with reverence to cry: Only Trinity,\
Equal in strength, without beginning, blessed are you.

****

Troparia

Fools did not recognise the voice spoken\
In prophecy, called it drunkenness from wine,\
When they heard the Apostles sayings in strange tongues;\
We the devout, inspired, cry out to you:\
Renewer of the universe, blessed are you.

The seer Joel, inspired, thundered an oracle\
Spoken by the divine Word:\
Those on whom I pour my Spirit\
Will cry out together: Nature,\
Shining with threefold splendour, blessed are you.

The third hour was made rich with grace,\
That it might indicate the worship of\
Three Persons in singleness of authority;\
But now on the one Sovereign of days,\
Son, Father, Spirit, blessed are you.

Ode 8. Irmos.

Unconsumed by fire the bush on Sinai spoke and made God known to the
slow-tongued Moses, clumsy in speech; and their burning zeal for God
revealed the three young men unharmed by fire and singing: All you works
of the Lord, praise the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.

****

Troparia

When from on high the mighty, living wind of the All-holy Spirit came to
the fishermen with sound in the form of fiery tongues, they began with
eloquence to proclaim the mighty works of God: All you works of the
Lord, praise the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the ages.

As we advance to the mountain which must not be touched, unafraid of the
terrifying fire, come, let us stand on mount Sion, in the city of the
living God, as we now dance with the spirit-bearing Disciples: All you
works of the Lord, praise the Lord, and highly exalt him to all the
ages.

\[

**2:1-11**\]

When the day of Pentecost had come, all the Apostles were together in
one place. And suddenly a sound came from heaven like the rush of a
mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And
there appeared to them tongues as of fire, divided and resting on each
one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to
speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them power of utterance. Now
there were dwelling in Jerusalem devout Jews from every nation under
heaven. And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were
bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in their own language.
And they were amazed and astonished, saying, ‘Are not all these who are
speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us in their own
native language? Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of
Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and
Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and
visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians, we
hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.’

Then the Deacon says:

Again and again on bended knees, let us pray to the Lord.

People: Lord, have mercy.

****

And as we bend our knees to the ground and uncover, the Priest reads the
prayers from the Bema, facing west, in a loud voice for all to hear.

Immaculate, undefiled, without beginning, invisible, incomprehensible,
unsearchable, unchangeable, unsurpassable, immeasurable, long-suffering
Lord, who alone possess immortality and dwell in unapproachable light;
who made the heaven, the earth and the sea and all that was created in
them; who grant to all their requests before they ask; we pray and
beseech you, Master who love mankind, the Father of our Lord and God and
Saviour Jesus Christ, who for our sake and for our salvation came down
from heaven and was incarnate from the Holy Spirit and Mary, the
Ever-Virgin and glorious Mother of God.

Teaching us first by words and later also showing us by deeds, when he
underwent the saving Passion, he granted us, your humble, sinful and
unworthy servants, an example to offer supplications by the bending of
neck and knees for our sins and those committed in ignorance by the
people. Do you, then, who are full of mercy and love for mankind, hear
us on whatever day we call upon you; but especially on this day of
Pentecost, on which after our Lord Jesus Christ had been taken up and
been enthroned at your right hand, God and Father, he sent down on his
disciples and Apostles the holy Spirit, who settled on each one of them
and they were all filled with his inexhaustible grace and spoke in
strange tongues of your mighty works and prophesied.

Now therefore hear us as we pray, remember us, humble and condemned, and
turn back the captivity of our souls. Receive us as we fall before you
and cry out, ‘We have sinned’. On you we have been cast from the womb.
From our mother’s womb you are our God. But because our days have wasted
away in vanity, we have been stripped of your help, we have been
deprived of all defence. But confident of your compassion we cry, ‘Do
not remember the sins of our youth and cleanse us of our secret faults.
Do not cast us aside in the time of old age. When our strength fails, do
not abandon us. Before we return to the earth, count us worthy to turn
back to you and give heed to us with kindness and grace. Measure our
iniquities by your acts of compassion. Set against the multitude of our
offences the depth of your compassion. Look from your holy height, Lord,
upon your people here present and who await from you rich mercy. Visit
us in your goodness; deliver us from the oppression of the devil; make
our lives safe with your holy and sacred laws. Entrust your people to a
faithful Angel guardian; gather us all into your kingdom; give pardon to
all who hope in you; forgive their sins and ours; purify us by the
operation of your holy Spirit; destroy all the wiles of the foe against
us’.

****

He adds this prayer:

Blessed are you Lord, Master almighty, who made the day light with the
light of the sun and the night radiant with the rays of fire; who have
granted us to pass through the length of the day and to draw near the
beginnings of the night. Hear our supplication and that of all your
people. And pardoning all of us our offences, voluntary and involuntary,
accept our evening entreaties and send down the multitude of your rich
mercy and acts of compassion on your inheritance. Wall us about with
your holy Angels; arm us with the arms of justice; fence us with the
rampart of your truth; guard us by your power; deliver us from every
misfortune and from every trick of the adversary. Grant us also that
both the present day with the coming night and all the days of our life
may be perfect, holy, peaceful, sinless, without stumbling, without
dreams, at the prayers of the holy Mother of God and of all the Saints
who have been well-pleasing to you since time began.

The Priest prays as before:

[]{#Thur12June}Lord Jesus Christ our God, who, while still present with
us in this life, gave your peace to humankind, and ever grant the gift
of the all-holy Spirit to the faithful as an inheritance which cannot be
taken away, you sent down this grace today in a more manifest form to
your Disciples and Apostles and gave eloquence to their lips with
tongues of fire, through which we, every race of humankind, having
received the knowledge of God in our own language by the hearing of the
ear, have been enlightened by the light of the Spirit, delivered from
the darkness of error and, by the distribution and supernatural force of
the perceptible tongues of fire, have been taught faith in you and have
been illumined to speak of you as God with the Father and the holy
Spirit in one Godhead, power and authority.

Do you, then, the radiance of the Father, the unchangeable and
unalterable stamp of his Essence and nature, the source of salvation and
grace, open also the lips of me, a sinner, and teach me how I should and
for whom I ought to pray, for you know the multitude of my sins, but
your compassion will overcome their measureless number. For see, with
fear I stand before you, having cast away despair of my soul into the
sea of your mercy. Govern my life, by the ineffable power of your
wisdom, you who govern all creation by a word, who are the fair haven of
the storm-tossed, and make known to me the way in which I shall walk.

Grant to my thoughts the Spirit of your wisdom, to my folly the Spirit
of understanding, with the Spirit of your fear overshadow my deeds.
Renew a right Spirit within my inward parts and make firm the
instability of my mind with the sovereign Spirit, so that guided each
day by your good Spirit to what is profitable, I may be found worthy to
do your commandments and always keep in mind your Coming, which searches
out all that we have done. Do not neglect me, so that I become deceived
by the corrupted pleasures of the world, but give me strength to yearn
for the enjoyment of the treasures which are to come. For you said,
Master, that whatever someone asks in your name they receive without
restraint from your co-eternal God and Father. And so I a sinner at the
coming of your holy Spirit implore your goodness, ‘The things that I
have prayed for grant me for my salvation’. Yes, Lord, the loving and
most generous giver of every benefaction, for it is you who give
superabundantly more than we ask. It is you who are compassionate,
merciful, who without sin became a partaker in our flesh and who in
loving compassion bend down to those who bend the knee to you and became
the atonement for our sins. Give your people, Lord, your acts of pity;
hear us from your holy heaven; sanctify us by the power of your saving
right hand; shelter us in the shelter of your wings; do not despise the
works of your hands. Against you alone we have sinned, but it is you
alone that we adore. We do not know how to worship a strange god, nor to
spread out our hands, Master, to another god. Forgive us our offences
and, accepting our supplications on our bended knees, stretch out to us
all a helping hand. Accept the prayer of all as acceptable incense,
rising up before your kingdom, above all goodness.

****

And he adds the following prayer:

Lord, Lord, who have delivered us from every arrow that flies by day,
deliver us also from every deed that walks in darkness. Accept as an
evening sacrifice the lifting up of our hands. Count us worthy also to
pass through the stadium of the night untried by evils, and rescue us
from every disturbance and fear which comes to us from the Devil. Grant
our souls the grace of compunction and our thoughts concern for the
examination at your dread and just judgement. Nail down our flesh with
fear of you, and deaden our members that are on earth, so that, in the
calm of sleep, we may be made radiant with joy by the contemplation of
your judgements. Remove from us every unseemly imagining and harmful
desire. Raise us up at the time for prayer strengthened in the faith and
advancing in your commandments.

****

your grace.

****

Then

Grant, Lord, this evening. ****

After which the Deacon:

Again and again, on bended knees, let us pray to the Lord.

****

The Priest prays:

Christ our God, ever-flowing Spring, source of life and illumination,
co-eternal creative power of the Father, for the salvation of mortals,
who fulfilled the whole dispensation with surpassing goodness; tore
apart the indissoluble bonds of Death and the bars of Hell, trampling
down multitudes of evil spirits; offered yourself as an unblemished
oblation for our sake, giving your most pure body, intangible and
inaccessible to every sin, as a sacrifice, and through this dread and
inexpressible offering you granting us the grace of everlasting life.
You descended into Hell, smashed the everlasting bars and showed the way
up to those who sat below. With a bait of divine wisdom you hooked the
author of evil, the dragon of the deep, bound him with cords of darkness
in Tartarus and secured him with the unquenchable fire and the exterior
darkness through your infinitely powerful strength. Glorious wisdom of
the Father, who appeared to those in distress as a mighty helper and
enlightened those who sat in darkness and the shadow of death, Lord of
unending glory, beloved Son of the most high Father, eternal light from
eternal light, Sun of justice, hear us who entreat you and give rest to
the souls of your servants who have fallen asleep before us, our
fathers, mothers and brethren and the rest of our relatives according to
the flesh and all our kinsfolk of the household of the faith, whose
memory we too now keep, because in you is the might of all things and in
your hand you hold all the ends of the earth.

Master almighty, God of our fathers and Lord of mercy, Creator of the
mortal and immortal race and of every human nature that is brought
together and again dissolved, of life and death, of our sojourn here and
our translation there, you apportion times to the living and establish
the moments of death. You lead down to Hell and you lead up. You bind
with weakness and release with power. You dispose all things for our use
and direct what is to come for our advantage. You give life by hope of
resurrection to those wounded by the sting of Death. Master of all
things, our God and Saviour, the hope of all the ends of the earth and
of those far off upon the sea, who on this final, great and saving day
of Pentecost revealed to us the mystery of the holy, consubstantial,
co-eternal, undivided and uncompounded Trinity and the coming and
presence of your holy and life-giving Spirit poured out in the form of
tongues of fire on your holy Apostles, setting them as Evangelists of
our true faith, revealing them as confessors and heralds of true
theology; who have also been pleased on this most perfect and saving
Feast to receive suppliant prayers of atonement for those who are
immured in Hell, granting us great hopes that repose and comfort will be
sent down from you to the departed from the pains which hold them, hear
us, lowly and wretched, who entreat you, and give rest to the souls of
your servants who have fallen asleep before us in a place of light, a
place of green pasture, a place of refreshment, from which all grief,
sorrow and sighing have fled away, and establish their spirits in the
tents of the Just and count them worthy of peace and repose. Because the
dead will not praise you, O Lord, nor do those in Hell have the freedom
to offer you thanksgiving, but we the living bless you and implore you
and bring before you atoning prayers and sacrifices on behalf of their
souls.

****

And he adds this Prayer:

God, great and eternal, holy and lover of humankind, who have counted us
worthy to stand at this hour before your unapproachable glory to hymn
and praise your wonders, be gracious to us, your unworthy servants.
Grant us grace to offer you without conceit and with a broken heart the
thrice-holy hymn of glory and thanksgiving for your great gifts, which
you have made us and always do so.

Remember, Lord, our weakness and do not destroy us with our iniquities,
but in our humiliation show us your great mercy, so that fleeing the
darkness of sin we may walk in the daylight of justice; and having put
on the weapons of light we may persevere unassailed by any assault of
the evil one, and that with boldness we may glorify you for all things,
the only true God and lover of humankind. For indeed, Master and Maker
of all things, truly great is your mystery: the temporary dissolution of
your creatures and after this their restoration and repose to the ages.
We give thanks to you for all things, for our entrances into this world
and for our departures, which through your unfailing promise betoken for
us beforehand our hopes of resurrection and unending life. Would that we
may enjoy it at your future second Coming, for you are the author of our
resurrection and the impartial judge who loves humankind of what we have
done in life, the Master and Lord of our reward.

Through your supreme condescension you became a partaker with us in the
same flesh and blood and in those passions of ours that are blameless by
willingly submitting to temptation, and, possessing compassionate pity,
having yourself suffered by being tempted, and, as you promised, have
yourself become a helper for us who are tempted, and so you have also
led us to dispassion. Accept therefore, Master, our supplications and
entreaties, and give rest to all the fathers and mothers, brothers and
sisters, and children of each, and to every other kinsman and relative,
and to all the souls who have gone to their rest before us in the hope
of resurrection to eternal life, and establish their spirits and their
names in the book of life and in the bosoms of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
and in the land of the living, for the kingdom of heaven, in the
Paradise of pleasure, through your shining Angels introducing them into
your holy mansions. With them raise our bodies also on the day which you
have appointed in accordance with your holy and unfailing promises.
There is therefore no death for your servants, Lord, when we go out from
the body and come to you, O God, but a translation from sorrowful things
to better and more desirable, and rest and joy. But if we have in
anything sinned against you, be gracious to us and them, because no one
is clean of defilement before you, though they last but a day, except
you alone, who appeared sinless upon earth, our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom we all hope to obtain mercy and forgiveness of sins.
Therefore, as you are good and love humankind, remit, forgive, pardon us
our faults, voluntary and involuntary, in knowledge and in ignorance,
manifest and unnoticed, in deed, in thought, in word, of all our actions
and movements. Give freedom and respite to those who have gone before us
and bless all of us here present, granting a good and peaceful end to us
and to all your people, and opening to us the compassion of your mercy
and love for humankind at your dread and fearful Second Coming, and make
us all worthy of your kingdom.

He also adds this.

Great and most high God, who alone possess immortality and dwell in
unapproachable light, who made all creation with wisdom, who made a
separation between the light and the darkness and placed the sun to rule
the day and the moon and the stars to rule the night, who have counted
us sinners worthy on this present day to come before your face with
thanksgiving and to offer you our evening worship. Direct our prayer,
Lord, like incense before you and accept it as a sweet fragrance. Grant
us also that the present evening and the coming night may be peaceful;
clothe us with the weapons of light; deliver us from every terror of the
night and from every deed that operates in darkness, and give us sleep,
which you have given for the repose of our weakness, free from every
diabolical vision. Yes, Master of all things, giver of blessings, may
we, being moved to compunction on our beds, call to mind your all-holy
Name in the night, and made radiant by the meditation of your
commandments may we rise up with joy of soul to give glory to your
loving-kindness, offering supplications and entreaties to your
compassion for our sins and those of all your people. Visit them in your
mercy at the prayers of the holy Mother of God.

****

Deacon:

Help us, save us, have mercy on us, raise us up and guard us, O God, by
your grace.

****

People:

Lord, have mercy.

Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most blessed and glorious Lady, Mother
of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, with all the Saints, let us entrust
ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God.

****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

The Priest, aloud:

For you are the repose of our souls and bodies and to you we give glory,
to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the
ages of ages.

****

People

: Amen. ****

Deacon:

Let us complete our evening prayer to the Lord.

Help us, save us, have mercy on us and keep us, O God, by your grace.

That the whole day may be perfect, holy, peaceful and sinless, let us
ask of the Lord.

****

People:

Grant this, O Lord. **And so after each of the following petitions.**

Deacon

: An angel of peace, a faithful guide, a guardian of our souls and
bodies, let us ask of the Lord.

Pardon and forgiveness of our sins and offences, let us ask of the Lord.

Things good and profitable for our souls, and peace for the world, let
us ask of the Lord.

That we may live out the rest of our days in peace and repentance, let
us ask of the Lord.

A Christian end to our life, painless, unashamed and peaceful, and a
good defence before the dread judgement seat of Christ, let us ask.

Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most blessed and glorious Lady, Mother
of God and Ever-Virgin Mary, with all the Saints, let us entrust
ourselves and one another and our whole life to Christ our God.

****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

Priest:

For you, O God, are good and love mankind, and to you we give glory, to
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the
ages of ages.

****

People:

Amen. ****

Priest:

Peace to all. ****

People:

And to your spirit. ****

Deacon:

Let us bow our heads to the Lord. ****

People:

To you, O Lord. ****

The Priest reads this quietly:

Lord, our God, who bowed the heavens and came down for the salvation of
the human race, look upon your servants and upon your inheritance; for
to you the fearful Judge who love mankind your servants have bowed their
heads and inclined their necks, not waiting for any human help, but
awaiting your mercy and looking for your salvation. Guard them at every
moment, during both the present evening and the approaching night, from
every foe, from every hostile operation of the devil, and from vain
thoughts and evil desires.

(

**Aloud**): Blessed and glorified be the might of your Kingdom, of the
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to
the ages of ages. ****

People:

Amen. ****

At the Aposticha we sing the Idiomels in Tone 3.

Now the tongues have clearly become a sign to all: for the Jews, from
whom came Christ according to the flesh, have become sick through
unbelief and fallen from divine grace, and we from the nations have been
counted worthy of the divine light, established by the words of the
Disciples, as they declaim the glory of God the benefactor of all
things; with them, as we bow our hearts with our knees, in faith let us
worship, established by the holy Spirit, the Saviour of our souls.

****

Verse:

Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.

Now the Advocate Spirit has been poured out on all flesh: for beginning
with the choir of the Apostles, from them he has unfolded grace by
participation to the faithful, and he confirms his mighty descent
distributing the tongues in the form of fire to the Disciples, to the
praise and glory of God. And so with hearts spiritually illumined and
established in faith in the holy Spirit, we entreat that our souls may
be saved.

****

Verse:

Do not cast me away from your presence: and take not your holy Spirit
from me.

Now the Apostles of Christ are clothed with might from above; for the
Advocate, being renewed in them, renews them with mystical newness of
knowledge, which they proclaim in strange voices and lofty words,
teaching us to reverence the eternal, simple and three-personned nature
of the God of all things. And so enlightened by their doctrines, let us
worship the Father with the Son and the Spirit, imploring that our souls
may be saved.

Glory. Both now.

**Tone 8.**

Come, you peoples, let us worship the Godhead in three persons, the Son
in the father, with the Holy Spirit; for the Father timelessly begot the
Son, co-eternal and co-reigning, and the Holy Spirit was in the Father,
glorified with the Son; one power, one essence, one Godhead, whom we all
worship as we say: Holy God, who created all things through the Son,
with the co-operation of the Holy Spirit. Holy Strong, through whom we
have come to know the Father, and through whom the Holy Spirit came into
the world. Holy Immortal, the Advocate Spirit, who proceeds from the
Father and rests in the Son. Holy Trinity, glory to you.

****

Then

Now, Master, **the Trisagion etc., and the Apolytikion of the Feast
three times.**

Apolytikion. Tone 8.

Blessed are you, Christ our God, who revealed the fishermen to be most
wise by sending down to them the Holy Spirit, and so through them
catching the whole world in a net: Lover of mankind, glory to you!

****

Then the Priest gives the Dismissal:

May he who emptied himself from the bosom of the Father and took up our
whole human nature and made it divine, and who after he had gone up
again to heaven and sat down at the right hand of his God and Father
sent down the divine, holy, consubstantial, co-eternal Spirit, identical
in power and identical in glory, upon his holy Disciples and Apostles,
and through him enlightened them, and through them the whole inhabited
world, Christ our true God, at the prayers of his all-pure and
all-blameless holy Mother, of the holy, glorious and all-praised
Apostles, heralds of God, and of all the Saints, have mercy on us and
save us through his own loving-kindness.

****

Reader:

Amen.
