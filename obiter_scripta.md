OBITER SCRIPTA
--------------

In English legal parlance ‘obiter dicta’ are remarks made by a judge ‘by
the way’, as an expression of opinion, but not essential and of no
binding authority.

During the course of the Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain’s
Translation Committee’s work on the Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom,
Bishop Kallistos expressed the hope that the background material that I
had prepared would one day be published. Publication on the Web is
perhaps the simplest and most convenient way of achieving this 

The following pages, then, will contain various papers and reviews
written in the course of my work of translating our Orthodox texts, not
only that of the Divine Liturgy. They will explain the reasons for some
of the decisions I have made in the course of this work. Because of the
nature of much of the material, including the use of diagrams, tables
and non-Roman scripts, in particular Greek, Church Slavonic and Hebrew,
most of the files will be in PDF format, for which Adobe Acrobat Reader
is necessary.
