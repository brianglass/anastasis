SUNDAY OF THE HOLY FOREFATHERS
------------------------------

[AT
VESPERS]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

**After the Opening Psalm we recite the whole of the 1st Kathisma of the
Psalter.**

[At Â‘]{style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua";color:red"}[Lord, I
have cried[Â’, we insert 10 stichera, and sing 3 of the Resurrection, 3
by Anatolios and 4 Prosomia of the
Forefathers.]{style="color:red"}]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[Tone 8.
]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua";
color:red"}

[Today, as we celebrate the memorial of the Forefathers, let us the
faithful raise a hymn to Christ the Redeemer, the Lord who magnifies
them among all the nations, and faithfully performs extraordinary
wonders, as he is mighty and powerful; and he showed forth from them a
rod of power for us, pure Mary the Child of God who alone knew no man,
from whom the flower, Christ, came forth, blossoming life for all and
pleasure without cost and eternal life.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[Master, who delivered the Holy Youths from the fire, and Daniel from
the lionsÂ’ mouths; who blessed Abraham and Isaac your servant and his
son Jacob; who were well pleased to be born from their seed for us, that
you might save the Forefathers who had fallen away of old, to be
crucified and buried, and you smash all the bonds of death, and you
raise all who from every age were among the dead, who worship, O Christ,
your eternal Kingdom.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[By the dew of the Spirit GodÂ’s Youths rejoicing as in rain walked
mystically in the midst of the flame, typifying in advance the Trinity
and ChristÂ’s incarnation; and as wise through faith they quenched the
power of fire. And the just Daniel appeared as a tamer of lions.
Besought by their intercessions, O Saviour who loves mankind, deliver us
also from the unquenchable and eternal fire, and make us worthy to gain
your heavenly Kingdom.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

The faithful, Holy Youths in the furnace of fire, as in dew, mystically
prefigured your coming from the Virgin, which shone forth without
burning for us. And the just Daniel, wonderful among Prophets, clearly
foreshowed your second divine coming when he cried: I see where thrones
are set, and the judge has taken his throne, and a river of fire is
present; from which at their intercessions may we be delivered, O Master
Christ.

[Glory. [Tone 6. By
Anatolios.]{style="color:red"}]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[Let us the faithful today praise all the Fathers before the law:
Abraham, God’s friend, Isaac, born by promise, Jacob and the twelve
Patriarchs; honouring with them meek David and Daniel the Prophet of
desires, and the three Children who changed the furnace into dew, asking
forgiveness of Christ God, who is glorified in his
Saints.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[Both now. [Theotokion. The 1st of the Tone of the
Week.]{style="color:red"}]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[At the Aposticha the Resurrection stichera of the
Tone.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua";
color:red"}

[Glory. [Tone 3. By
Germanos.]{style="color:red"}]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

Come, lovers of festival, let us praise in song the gathering of the
Forefathers: Adam the Forefather, Enoch. Noah, Melchisedek, Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob; after the law Moses and Aaron, Jesus, Samuel and David;
with them Isaias, Jeremias, Ezekiel and Daniel, and the Twelve with
Elias, Elisaius and them all; Zachary and the Baptist and all who
proclaimed Christ, the life and resurrection of our race.

[Both now. [Theotokion. The same
Tone.]{style="color:red"}]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[By the Father’s will without seed you conceived of the Holy Spirit the
Son of God, who is from the Father without mother before the ages, but
for us he came of you without father; you bore him in the flesh and
suckled him as a babe; therefore do not cease to intercede that our
souls may be delivered from dangers.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[Apolytikion of the
Resurrection.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua";
color:red"}

[Glory. Both now. [Of the Forefathers. Tone
2.]{style="color:red"}]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[You justified the Forefathers by faith, through them betrothing in
advance the Church from the nations. The Saints will exult in glory, for
from their seed there is a glorious fruit, she who bore you without
seed. At their intercessions, Christ God, save our
souls.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[And
Dismissal.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua";
