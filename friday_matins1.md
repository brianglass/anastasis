him to all the
ages.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

**Troparia.**

[Master beyond time, you loose me from timeless bonds, becoming
subÂ­ject to time and given up of your own will and banishing the proud
foe in indissoluble bonds, and you save me by your Cross and Passion:
therefore I bless you, O Christ, to all the
ages.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[O Word, highly exalted, without beÂ­ginning, invisible, you were
willingly raised on the Cross, raising all creaÂ­tion with you and
making a spectacle of all the principalities and powers of darkness, O
Christ, by your Passion; therefore we praise you to all the
ages.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

praise the Lord and highly exalt him to all the
ages.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

is this newest wonder? He who gives life to all is dying
willingly.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[**Of the Mother of God. The same
Irmos.**]{style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"}

[The Creator, who is unapproachable by all the ranks above, dwelt in
your womb, keeping you unharmed by fire and incorrupt after child-birth;
to him we now cry out: You works praise the Lord and highly exalt him to
all the
ages.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[Pure of stains and taints and a shrine of all holiness you bore the
all-holy Word, who makes all things holy and is without beginning with
the Father; therefore, O Virgin, we praise and highly exalt you to all
the
ages.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

all-blessed Mother of God, pure and
Ever-Virgin!]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

**Troparia.**

[He stands judged who is going to judge the universe, O Lover of
manÂ­kind; you willingly bind on a crown of thorns, O Saviour, plucking
up the thorn of disobedience by the roots, O Christ, and implanting in
all the knowledge of your
compassion]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[Oh how does the unjust people, darkened by envy, betray you to a cross,
O just and blameless and Giver of life. Seeing your passion the sun
grows dark and the splendour of the Temple is rent and the foundations
of the earth are
shaken.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

**Of the Martyrs.**

[Holy Martyrs, you are called companÂ­ions of the sufferings of Christ
and fellow heirs of the KingÂ­dom and the glory; therefore, O wise ones,
give light to those who hymn you, scattering the gloom of sin and
manifold
disasters.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[Already, wise Martyrs, you have made your dwelling in heaven itself,
receiving eternal glory and deified by sacred participation in God’s
life; remember us all who honour with faith your all-sacred and revered
memory, O
all-praised.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

**Theotokion.**

[Enlighten, O pure one, those who hymn and magnify you with longing;
destroy the darkness of our passions, O Maiden; end the tempest; take
from our midst the stumbling blocks of the evil one; subdue the children
of Hagar to our devout King by your
prayers.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

**Of the Mother of God. Another Irmos.**

[\[[Eve by the sickness of disobedience gave entrance to the curse; but
you, Virgin Mother of God, by the offshoot of your child-bearing made
blessing flower for the world; therefore we all magnify
you.\]]{style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"}]{style="color:windowtext"}

[Pure Bride of God, the spiritual coal which Isaias saw you carry in
your arms, O Mother of God, united with our form and a beacon of
salvation for the world; therefore we all magÂ­nify
you.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[The Prophets proclaimed in advance the symbols of your birth-giving,
inÂ­structed in these mysteries from afar, and by the divine inspiration
of the Spirit proclaiming them loudly to the world; at whose fulfilment
we now
marvel.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[Lovely in his beauty and fairer than all is he fruit of your womb, for
you, Virgin Mother of God, gave birth to God incarnate that he might
save mankind; therefore we all magnify
you.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

**Aposticha of Lauds. Of the Cross.**

[May your Cross be a wall for us, Jesu our Saviour; for we faithful have
no other hope but you who were nailed to it and who grant us your great
mercy.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

**Model melody.**

[You have given as a sign to those who fear you, Lord, your precious
Cross, through which you triumphed over the principalities and powers of
darkness and brought us back to our ancient blessedness; therefore we
glorify your loving dispensation, O Jesu all-powerful, the Saviour of
our
souls.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

**Of the Martyrs.**

[Who is not amazed, holy Martyrs, seeing the good fight that you fought;
how while still in the body you conÂ­quered the bodiless foe, confessing
Christ and armed with the Cross? Therefore you were fittingly named
routers of demons and enemies of barbarians, as you intercede
unceasÂ­ingly that our souls may be saved.
]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[As noblest of
Martyrs.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua";
color:red"}

[When the Virgin, your Mother, saw You hanging on the Cross, O Lord, she
was amazed and cried out with yearning: My Son, so well-beloved, why
have you been fixed to the tree of the Cross, O Long-suffering One? Why
have your hands and feet been nailed by lawless men, O Word? Why have
you shed your blood, O
Master?]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[AT THE LITURGY]{style="font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"}

[**The
Beatitudes**]{style="text-transform:uppercase;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"}

[Through a tree Adam became an exÂ­ile from Paradise, but through the
Tree of the Cross the Thief made Paradise his home; the one by tasting
rejected the commandment of his Maker, the other, crucified with him
confessed the hidden God, crying: Remember me in your
kingdom.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[The Powers of heaven, at a loss through fear, were amazed seeing you
stretched on the Cross, O only Long-suffering; the earth was shaken and
the beauty of the great lights was quenched; Adam the condemned was
justified when you were judged unÂ­justly, O Lover of mankind, and he
praised your loving
kindness.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[Lifted up on Calvary you destroyed the curse of the foe; by dying on
the Tree you gave life to those who had died through the fruit of the
tree, O Master, and declared them citizens of Paradise, who ceaselessly
sing your praise, Christ our God, and cry to you: Remember us also in
your
kingÂ­dom.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

**Of the Martyrs.**

[Holy Martyrs, having taken up the Cross as a weapon you marched out
with noble intent against the ranks of the foe, and having destroyed
them you were garlanded with victors’ wreathes and gained glory and
divine splendour, O admirable ones; thereÂ­fore with faith we all call
you
blest.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[Glory.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[To show your compassion for us openly, O Saviour, who are one with the
Father and the Spirit, you were nailed to the Cross; and endured the
sponge and reed, blows and stripes, for you wished to deliver from
ever-living fire us who cry: Remember us also in your
kingdom.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[Both now.
[Theotokion.]{style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"}]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}

[The wholly uncontainable dwelt without constraint in your holy womb, O
Mother of God, immaculate Lady, and by dying on a Tree became a source
of life for the world. Implore him to slay our carnal thoughts and save
us all as he loves
mankind.]{style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Book Antiqua""}
