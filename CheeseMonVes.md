MONDAY OF CHEESE WEEK
=====================

AT VESPERS
----------

****

At

Lord I have cried**, the Stichera from the Oktoichos and the Menaion.**

At the Aposticha the following Idiomel, with the usual verses, as
yesterday.

Tone 8

Let us hurry to be cleansed through fasting from the stain of our faults
and through mercy and compassion for the poor to enter the bridal
chamber of Christ the Bridegroom, who grants us his great mercy.

****

Verse 1.

To you I lift up my eyes, to you who are enthroned in the heavens. As
the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master: or as the eyes of
a maid toward the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our
God: until he show us his mercy.

Let us hurry to be cleansed through fasting from the stain of our faults
and through mercy and compassion for the poor to enter the bridal
chamber of Christ the Bridegroom, who grants us his great mercy.

****

Verse 2.

Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we have our fill of
derision; our soul has its fill. Mockery for those at ease: and derision
for the proud.

Martyrs of the Lord, we beg you: intercede with our God and ask for our
souls a multitude of mercies and pardon of our many transgressions.

Glory. Both now.

**Theotokion.**

Let us devoutly sing the praise of the glorious and immaculate true
Bearer of God as Mother of God, greeting her like the Angel, Â‘Hail,
holy Mother of the incarnate Son of God. Hail, dwelling place of the
Holy Spirit, who ever intercede for us that our souls may be savedÂ’.
