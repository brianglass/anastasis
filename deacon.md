front of the Altar, slightly to the left. The Archdeacon
says:]{style="color:red;

Deacons come from the Sanctuary and take the one who is to be ordained
Deacon, who is standing on the Solea, and bring him into the Sanctuary,
circling the Altar as they sing the following
Troparia]{style="color:red;mso-bidi-font-style:

After this the Bishop orders him to be ungirded and the towel to be
removed. Then the one to be ordained leans his forehead

in a low

[Lord, our God, by your foreknowledge you send down the gift of your
Holy Spirit upon those who are appointed by your inscrutable power to
become ministers and to assist in the service of your most pure
Mysteries. Keep this man also, Master, whom you have been well pleased
to ordain through me to the ministry of the Diaconate, in all soberness,
holding the mystery of faith with a pure conscience. Give him the grace
which you gave to Stephen the Protomartyr, whom you also called first to
the work of your service. Count him worthy to administer in accordance
with what is well pleasing to you the rank that has been given him by
your loving kindness Â— for those who have served well, gain for
themselves a fair rank Â— and show him to be your perfect servant. For
yours is the Kingdom and the power and the glory, of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

among you, let him be your deacon. Master of all things, fill this
servant of yours, whom you have counted worthy to enter upon the
ministry of the Deacon, with all faith, love, power and sanctification
by the indwelling of your holy and life-giving Spirit; for it is not by
the laying on of my hands, but by the visitation of your rich acts of
compassion that grace is given to your worthy ones, so that he, having
become free of every sin, may take his stand before you without blame on
the dread day of your judgement, and receive the unfailing reward of
your promise. For you are our God, and to you we give glory, with the
Father and the Holy Spirit, now and forever, and to the ages of ages.

In Greek *Kelefsate*. This is said twice in the plural and the third
time in the singular, addressed to the Bishop. The latter is the exact
equivalent of the Latin *Jube, Domne*, as in the old rite for Compline,
*Jube, Domne, benedicere*. The meaning is really something like, Â‘If
you pleaseÂ’, Â‘With your permissionÂ’. The same expression is used when
a Bishop presides Vespers or a Vigil. The canonarch announces the Tone
to be sung by saying to the Bishop, Â‘With your permission, holy Master,
Tone *x*Â’. At an ordination the expression is, in effect, the request
for the clergy, the people and the Bishop to give their consent to the
candidateÂ’s ordination. The cry Â‘Axios!Â’, Â‘Worthy!Â’, occurs after
the ordination has taken
place.]{style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"}
