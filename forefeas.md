The Forefeast of the Nativity begins on the feast of Saint Ignatios of
Antioch, 20 December, and lasts until the eve of the Feast on the twenty
fourth. Christmas is described in the liturgical books as **Pascha and
the services of the Forefeast reflect those of Holy Week. For example,
the final idiomel of the Royal Hours on Christmas Eve is modelled on the
Antiphon of Matins of Good Friday,** **Today he is hung upon the Tree,
which is also sung at the Ninth Hour of the Royal Hours of Good
Friday.** Moreover at Compline each evening there is a Triode, with the
same acrostics and Irmi as those for Matins in Holy Week which refer to
the day of the week. This of course does not fit at all, unless
Christmas falls on a Saturday; and even then the week is a day short and
so the Canon for Thursday, which, as in Holy Week, has eight Odes, is
sung at Matins on the 22nd. In the Greek Menaion the Canons at Compline
are as follows:

The Canon on the 23rd is the same as that in the Greek Menaion, though
no acrostic is given.

The Canons for Matins in the Greek Menaion are as follows:

The Greek Menaion solves the problem of the short week by using the
Great Thursday Canon, which of course has the full eight odes (the word
**great in Greek here strictly means** **long), for Matins on the twenty
second and that for Great Saturday as a first canon for Matins. The
Canon at Compline is in fact written to be sung to the same set of Irmi,
whih are the ones used on Great Saturday in Holy Week.The fact that the
Greek arrangement includes all the Canons found in the Slavonic and in
addition allows for all the Canons based on those for Holy Week suggests
that the Greek is the older one, of which the Slavonic is a
simplification.**

For some of these days we only give the texts for the Forefeast, but
hope to complete them in the future.
